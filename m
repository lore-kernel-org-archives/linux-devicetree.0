U-Boot tries hard to find and bind the UART using the stdout-path
link. I would like to add it in the UART node also but we were able to
work around it so far.

This doesn't seem like a device tree binding question but let me try
to answer it.

This is a problem - one of the challenges of driver model is that the
UART gets further away from the reset vector.

In U-Boot there is a single debug UART which can be supported by the
various serial drivers (only one can be selected on each platform).
There is a special debug_uart_init() function which is supposed to set
up the UART for that platform. After that, and until driver model UART
is up, console output can go through the debug UART.

Yes U-Boot and its device tree are normally built from the same tree
at the same time. We don't expect to have to support an older or newer
device tree with the same U-Boot binary. So I don't see a problem
here.

The UART should have as few dependencies as possible. But if the
particular platform needs to check a GPIO to find out the UART number
(i.e. stdout-path cannot be used) then we would need to support that
case. It hasn't come up yet but it might. I certainly see platforms
where we need some other nodes before relocation and would like to
mark them as such. But I hope that for UART we can generally use
stdout-path.

The list of drivers doesn't help that much. What would I do with such
a list, and where would I keep such platform-specific information
other than in the device tree? It seems much simpler to hold the
information about what the platform needs to get through early boot in
one place. Then we have just a few lines of generic code to deal with
it.

OK I'll update the patch and resend it.
