slimbus is specified as "SLIMbus" in the mipi specs, so I should 
probably stay with it and make it consistent across the patchset.

Yep it is .. I will fix that..

Okay, I will make sure that driver_data is aligned.

Thanks for spotting, this looks like a leftover, There is no use of node 
in this structure so I will remove it in next version.

Yep.. will do that.
