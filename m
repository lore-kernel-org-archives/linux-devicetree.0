Hi Rob,

Thanks for the comments,

Yes, currently one version and in future we might have to add if there 
are any hardware specific changes and this is Qualcomm specific hardware.

Changed.

There are two IRQ lines which hardware can support one for non-secure 
operating system and another for secure operating system.

Changed.

Currently four clocks are needed, details updated accordingly.

Actually that is not a max clock speed, its any array of operating 
frequencies which ICE can support.

That is right, needs to have multiple device node entries which 
differentiate between storage instances.
