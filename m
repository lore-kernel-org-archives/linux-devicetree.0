I am really busy now so I am not following closely other discussions. I
assume you are referring to clk-s2mps11.c. The of_node_put() matches
of_get_child_by_name() when parsing DT.

So why not of_node_put() just after parsing DT? Well, the result of
of_get_child_by_name() is stored in state container for entire device
life-cycle so we can use it in of_clk_del_provider().

That was the idea behind it. If it looks incorrect I would be happy to
see a patch :) .

Sure, I can do this. The clock is present on few devices I can test.
Depending on the current workqueue it may take few days. Just please
mark the patch RFT so it won't be applied before receiving
reviewed/tested tags.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
