I guess the question is that if they are effectively identical, then why
would they have separate compatible values? CMA is a particular user,
but there are other potential users (out of tree ION for example). The
other difference would be reserved regions that are in-use at boot time
(ie. framebuffer) and others that are completely free, but need to be
made available later. Are there any other conditions that could be
applicable here?

Compatible happens to be a convenient property to use for identifying
the usage model, but I wonder if it is the best. Another option would be
to add flag properties to indicate usage.... However, I am thinking out
loud at the moment and not telling you that you must change the model.
However, the document needs to be very explicit about the precedence and
how compatible or extra properties affect the behaviour.

As a thought experiment, how would you differentiate between regions
intended for different allocators? Say you had an imaginary system that
needs to support both GEM and CMA regions?

Actually, I got this backwards; I think it is /NOT/ reasonable for Linux
to use a reserved region unless explicitly told that it can do so.
Otherwise it goes and overwrites framebuffers and stuff.

Possibly not, but I've learned the hard way not to gratuitously deviate
from established convention.
