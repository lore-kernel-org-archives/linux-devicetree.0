This is mostly good. Just a few comments:

This uses a single cell to represent a GPIO ID within a GPIO controller.
The standard GPIO bindings use #gpio-cells, where that's a property in
the GPIO controller's node. I wonder if we shouldn't do the same here,
and call into the GPIO driver to parse #gpio-cells and give back the
Linux GPIO ID, just like of_get_named_gpio_flags() does. This would also
make this code able to cope with the GPIO of_xlate function returning a
different GPIO chip, which Grant put in place for banked GPIO controllers.

The locking I was talking about before is between the following line:

> +		ranges[i].gc = of_node_to_gpiochip(np_gpio);

and this code:

> +		ranges[i].name = dev_name(pctldev->dev);
> +		ranges[i].base = ranges[i].gc->base + gpio_offset;
> +		ranges[i].pin_base = pin_offset;

If of_node_to_gpiochip() doesn't mark the GPIO chip as "in use", then
the module that provides that device could be unloaded between the two
blocks of code above.

Re: your locking comments in your other email: ranges[i].gc doesn't
appear to be used anywhere else in pinctrl, so I think it's OK not to
lock the GPIO chip for any more time than between the above two blocks
of code.

Finally, just a minor nit:

> +		ranges[i].gc = of_node_to_gpiochip(np_gpio);
> +		if (!ranges[i].gc) {
> +			dev_err(pctldev->dev,
> +				"can not find gpio chip of node(%s)\n",
> +				np_gpio->name);
> +			of_node_put(np_gpio);
> +			return -EPROBE_DEFER;
> +		}
> +
> +		of_node_put(np_gpio);

could be slightly simpler:

+		ranges[i].gc = of_node_to_gpiochip(np_gpio);
+		of_node_put(np_gpio); <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
+		if (!ranges[i].gc) {
+			dev_err(pctldev->dev,
+				"can not find gpio chip of node(%s)\n",
+				np_gpio->name);
+			return -EPROBE_DEFER;
+		}
