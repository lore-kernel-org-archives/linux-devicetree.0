Not really contributing to the solution, but the hard question to
answer is when do you know what the most specific driver is? The most
specific driver might well be a module that can be loaded at any time,
while there might already be other less specific drivers around.

In general I would say that if your device is specific enough to
warrant a whole new driver, it should not declare compatibility with
the generic thing in the compatible, but then this is kind of exporting
an Linux implementation detail to DT.
