I'm not so sure that converting everything yet again to another
abstraction layer is a good solution. We've got one level of
abstraction today -- DT. And we've got the un-abstracted layer of
platform devices. Churning all drivers yet again seems like the wrong
way to do this. For things that we can pre-populate instead of adding
runtime abstraction, we should.

I think we can do better -- we can ask those vendors to not ship ACPI
at all, and ship DT themselves (together with us for review, etc).
Especially since doing a broken ACPI implementation today _just for
us_ will just distract them. If they need one for RT, fine. As I
mentioned elsewhere, shipping a flashed DTB is no different from
shipping ACPI from a future-proof point of view; we'll end up
overriding either at some point once we figure out things better.

It's sort of impossible to tell today. Since there are no ARM64
servers on the market, there's no market for RT on them. Nor are there
any machines that can be acquired to look at how they implemented
stuff. And the silicon vendors who have started doing some of this
work are mostly doing it in secret on their own.

i2c devices and several other things are not probable, either are ECs
on LPC, etc. All of those mostly fall into the category of
simple-to-describe-in-any-format though.

Strong agreement from me.
