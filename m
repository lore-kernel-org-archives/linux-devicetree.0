OK, I will rephrase this.

No, FlexRM is the HW block. One instance of FlexRM provides a set of
rings (typically 32 or more).

There are lot other registers in FlexRM apart from ring registers. Out of
these, only ring registers are accessible to non-secured world (i.e. Linux)
whereas all other registers are only accessible to secure-world firmware
(typically ATF).

The FlexRM is one HW block. It provides ring-based programming
interface to various offload engines which are separate HW blocks.

The driver for FlexRM is implemented as mailbox controller driver
while the offload engine drivers will be mailbox clients.
