Sorry, I'm short on time atm.  Which specific patches now depend on his
changes?

I'll be doing a topic branch for tglx for that, so it shouldn't be
rocket surgery.  The big unknown is the MMIO patch currently in
Russell's patch tracker.

We may end up waiting for MMIO and Sebastian's changes to land, then
applying this during the next cycle.

thx,

Jason.
