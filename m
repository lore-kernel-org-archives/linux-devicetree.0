Besides the dtc output scheme, I also like the idea of a more consistent
dts/dtsi file naming. What about the scheme below, which also allows us
to get rid of vendor-soc-vendor-board.dts naming (which already leads to
quite long names):

(a) vendor,soc.dtsi and vendor,board.dts

or if dtc/cpp doesn't like ',' in includes

(b) vendor-soc.dtsi and vendor-board.dts

for this patch, that would give us

marvell,berlin2.dtsi and sony,nsz-gs7.dts.

If you propose a scheme we should follow, I'd be happy to apply that
first on this patch set. If we have a dtc output scheme, too, that
scheme can be more like best practice instead of a hard rule.
