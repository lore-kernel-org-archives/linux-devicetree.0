My patches have not fixed any bugs for ACPI NUMA, but just based on it.
There are only three related patches:
[PATCH v7 06_15] arm64, numa  rework numa_add_memblk()
[PATCH v7 07_15] arm64, numa  Cleanup NUMA disabled messages.
[PATCH v7 14_15] arm64, acpi, numa  NUMA support based on SRAT and SLIT

arch/arm64/mm/numa.c          |  28 ++++--
drivers/of/of_numa.c          |   4 +-

My patches 1-5, 8, 11 will confict with it.

Hi, Catalin
I'm sorry to reply this email too late. Because I have been thinking if
there are any other solutions.

I try to adjust the sequence of my patches as below:
1. New functionality 		//queued in your branch  (my patches 9-14, and 6, 6 is clean-up)
2. 4.8-rc1			//apci numa series and my new functionality had been merged
3. bug fixes			//other 4.8-rc versions	 (my patches 1-5)
4. clean-up (pr_fmt)		//queued in 4.9		 (my patches 7-8)

And there only one confliction exist:
++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +static u8 numa_distance[MAX_NUMNODES][MAX_NUMNODES];			//choose this
 +static int numa_off;
++=======
+ static int numa_distance_cnt;
+ static u8 *numa_distance;
+ static bool numa_off;							//choose this
++>>>>>>> acpi
