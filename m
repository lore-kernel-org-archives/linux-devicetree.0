Yes.

I guess one thing I didn't make clear was my hope that whatever
firmware API or VM host implementation exists would be pre-installed
on the system so that distros never had to deal with it, or even know
it existed. That would then transform the many different HW
configurations into a single HW configuration as far as distros are
concerned, since they only target running as firmware clients or VM
guests. Essentially, we are creating a standard platform in SW, which
perhaps is still possible, rather than in HW, which seems unlikely at
present.
