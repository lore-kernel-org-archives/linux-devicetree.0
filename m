Yeah, I meant not to add backlight control till the time we are able to
get it working using PWM. Is this needed for the basic LCD functionality
to work? I would like to avoid the churn of adding it using GPIO now and
changing to PWM later, if possible.

Ah, okay. In your schematic, is GP2[14] connected to anything?

It sounds like this is a hack to enable backlight on this board. I think
either the backlight driver needs to gain functionality to enable the
GPIO. Or backlight could be treated as part of the panel and enabled
using enable-gpios property in the panel. TBH, I will be okay either
way. Can you check with Jyri, Tomi and rest of the DRM folks on what
should be right way of dealing with this?

Thanks,
Sekhar
