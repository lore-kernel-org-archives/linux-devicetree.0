Put another way, that's qcom,auto-mode-disable. Should we have two
properties? Or is it better to mark all regulators explicitly with
either auto-mode-enable or the absence of such a property? The bindings
take an approach of giving all these "boolean" properties a 0 or 1 value
so that the absence of the property indicates that we should use the
default value in the hardware.

Ok. I'll make up another patch for this one. Perhaps call it
regulator-over-current-protection?
