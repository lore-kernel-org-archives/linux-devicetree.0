This feels like something that should be well-known for the programming
model of the device. If the number of events and/or counters shange, I'd
expect other things to also change such that the device is no longer
compatible with previous versions.

The module-id property sounds like a HW description, but it's not
entirely clear to me what cfgen-map is; more comments on that below.

Generally, I think that separate instances are preferable.

As above, it's not clear to me what this property represents. Could you
please clarify?

Thanks,
