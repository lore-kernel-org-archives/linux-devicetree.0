So they are on headers, though you have to solder the actual header pins
yourself [1]. But also these are the normal pins multiplexed with GPIOs
and other peripherals, so keeping them disabled is in line with the
existing policy, if I got this correctly.

I agree that the status="disabled" is redundant, since we have that
exact line already in the .dtsi. But I saw it in other DTs as well, most
prominently in the sun8i-h3-orangepi-one.dts.

So I think we should remove the "status=" lines here, dtc will generate
an identical dtb out of it. But we should keep the uart descriptions in
to make it easier for users to see which SoC pins are used for these
pins labeled UART[012] in the board description and schematic. Also all
it takes to enable those is to overwrite the status property, which can
easily be done inline (without resizing the dtb).

Cheers,
Andre.
