My comments on the previous version of the patch still apply:

 - The voltage ranges being set need to be specified as ranges.
 - Frequencies that can't be supported due to limitations of the
   available supplies shouldn't be exposed to users.
 - The driver needs to handle errors.

You need to define units for all of these, and for the transition
latency you need to be clear about what's being measured (it looks like
the CPU time only, not any voltage ramping).

You also need to define how the core supplies get looked up.

I guess this comment is a cut'n'paste error.

You should define pr_fmt to always include __func__ in the messages
rather than open coding - ensures consistency and is less noisy in the
code.

This seems noisy...
