No. We support both UEFI and uboot on hikey. We must reserve these
mailbox buffer in DT. Otherwise, it's a problem to support uboot.
We should only deliver one kernel and one DTB to support both UEFI and
uboot.

And mailbox driver is already upgraded from beginning. Nobody can say
that it won't be upgraded again in the future.

By the way, UEFI is loaded in the upper memory region of hikey. It won't
break anything in linux kernel.

Since those mailbox buffer is declared as reserved with "no-map"
property, it means that linux kernel won't create the page table of
them.

The meaning of "no-map" is removing it from memory memblock.

I agree that reserved region shouldn't be described in the memory node.
And Leo didn't describe reserved region in memory node too.

The main concern is that we're supporting both UEFI and uboot.
Declaring these reserved buffer in DTB will be a better choice.

Yes, it's depend on CONFIG_EFI_STUB.

No, it's not never mapped. Leo just wants it to be mapped as
uncacheable in mailbox driver.

If we look at his mailbox node in DT, Leo used these memory regions
in reg property. He wants to use ioremap() in mailbox driver.

He didn't declare those buffer in memory node. He only declared it
in reserved-memory node. And it's not never be mapped. He use ioremap()
in the driver.

And I think that Leo could use phandle to reference the reserved buffer
in mailbox node. Then it could be more clear.
