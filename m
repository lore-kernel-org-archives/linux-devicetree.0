As I mentioned in second part of my comment, is it default, minimum,
maximum or what kind of sample rate? Or is the sample rate fixed?

I meant just explaining to me, for the purpose of this review. However it
seems like the datasheet is publicly available, so let me just check this
there.

I believe that the latest document is in the works, but as for style
