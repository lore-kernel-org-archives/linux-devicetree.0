OK, from what I know is that for "trivial" changes the driver and
dt-binding changes can go through one patch.
this patch started as a four-line patch which added two lines of
documentation and two lines of driver code.
however, with all the Kconfig/comment/etc updates I think that you are
right and it's worth splitting this into two patches (one for the
clock driver and one for the dt-binding changes)

yes, especially since Carlo wrote the clock driver (and has worked for
his company with Meson8b SoCs)

Oleg has already asked if he could help testing: [0]
he confirmed that the clock controller (and my work-in-progress MMC
driver) works fine on his "Tronsmart MXIII Plus" (Meson8m2 aka S812).
I personally have a Akaso M8S (Meson8m2 aka S812, 2GiB RAM, Fast
Ethernet, 8GB NAND flash and a Realtek RTL8723BS SDIO wifi/bluetooth
chip)

on my own device I could even get the RTL8723BS driver to load the
firmware (I don't get any results when scanning, but I blame the
strange driver for now). this means that PWM works fine as well (so
the period and duty cycle are calculated correctly - or in other
words: it seems that the input clocks are correct and lead to a 32.768
kHz PWM clock output)

USB is working fine for me, whereas Oleg gets an error on his device
in the PHY driver ("USB ID detect failed!") -> this also seems to
happen on some GXBB boards, so it's unrelated to the gates (..I
guess).
