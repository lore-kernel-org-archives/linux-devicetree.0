I don't believe that was the goal in creating drivers/soc.

Well, I don't think that drivers/soc wants to be the new drivers/misc
either. ;)

Thinking more about what this RPM driver actually does, and since you
mentioned patterns across SoCs, it seems to me the RPM driver bascially
just doing the IPC.

So, rather than MFD or drivers/soc, it seems to me that it should be
implmented as a controller in the new common mailbox framwork[1] being
worked on by Jassi Brar (added to Cc.)

IIUC, RPM is actually only doing one-way IPC (it only exposes a write()
interface to clients) so it seems like a rather simple implementation of
a mailbox controller.

I believe Bjorn is already on the list of folks Cc'd on the common
mailbox framework, so it would be good to hear from him why RPM wouldn't
fit under that framework.

Thanks,

Kevin
