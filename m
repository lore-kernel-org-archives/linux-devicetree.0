This patchset adds support for memory mapped architected timers. We
don't have any other global broadcast timer in our system, so we use the
mmio timer during low power modes. The first patch is the binding.
The next two patches lay some groundwork so that the last patch is simpler.
The final patch adds support for mmio timers.

Patches are based on a recent patch from Mark that removes the
physical count reading (clocksource: arch_timer: use virtual counter,
