I share your concern, but I don't think the dma-outer-coherent attribute
would be a good solution either.

The problem really is that keystone is a platform that is sometimes
coherent, depending purely on what kernel we run, and not at all on
anything we can describe in devicetree, and I don't see any good way
to capture the behavior of the hardware in generic DT bindings.

So far, the assumption has been:

- when running a non-LPAE kernel, keystone is not coherent, and we
  must ignore both the dma-coherent properties in devices and the
  dma-ranges properties in bus nodes.
- when running an LPAE kernel, keystone is coherent, and we must
  respect both of those.

My interpretation of Bill's description above is that we now have
an additional requirement that at least I was not aware of before,
regarding the outer-sharable attribute. I don't think there is
much value in making this a boot-time option, since everyone would
want to run this platform in a cache-coherent way if at all possible.

We already have special hacks to detect the case of keystone running
in LPAE mode, in order to do the special rewrite-all-page-tables
hack at boot time for relocating the physical address, and we could
use the same hack to change the page table attributes.

The question is how to communicate the requirement for outer-sharable
for a platform. If we think it's a safe assumption that there will
not be future 32-bit platforms with this requirement (or maybe one
or two more at most), we could leave it in the special keystone hack.
Alternatively, a DT property in an appropriate node could indicate
that a particular platform requires it.
