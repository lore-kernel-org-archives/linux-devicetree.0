These enumerations can follow the MPIDR for convenience if the MPIDR
allocations are sane, but otherwise it would be abstract.  The Architecture
doesn't specify any kind of an ID for a cluster (indeed, it doesn't really
specify what a cluster is at all).


However, we could require a platform or SoC binding to specify the
enumeration and it how it maps to the actual hardware -- i.e., cluster@1
on Tuesday should be the same physical cluster as cluster@1 on Monday,
to the extent that cluster@1 is present in the DT on both days and the
hardware hasn't been physically modified (i.e., cluster@1 might refer
to a fixed physical socket on a hypothetical board with physically
pluggable CPU modules).

Correspondingly, on TC2, cluster@0 would always be the A15 cluster;
cluster@1 would always be the A7 cluster.  But if the firmware disables
one of them, that cluster and the relevant CPU nodes should be removed
from the DT before passing it to the kernel.

Does this make any sense, or is it overkill?
