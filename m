Sure.

Because it's awkward to have to do a table with each cpu compatible
value that is known to support LPAE everywhere it's needed.

Alternatively we could have a common compatible field for shared
features, but that also won't scale (we don't have a compatible field
today to indicate architecture version, and this would be an
incremental part on top of that).

That is true for many other device tree properties too.

Compare this to the PowerPC processor binding from IEEE1275, and
you'll see that there are some similarities, for example when it comes
to properties describing support of certain instructions (which could
be probed by inserting illegal instruction handlers and attempting to
execute them). They also have properties for cpu-version and a few
other similar things that can be read from registers.

It's problematic because you really need to annotate every platform
that _doesn't_ support LPAE to get something that works. Otherwise, if
you have one platform that selects something like CONFIG_HAVE_LPAE,
then just enabling that platform together with the rest of them means
you can turn it on, even if the older platforms can't boot any more.

So, you'd need every non-A15/A7 platform select a CONFIG_NO_LPAE of
whatnot, which doesn't scale.

Alternatively we'll need to add a config option per cpu, and have
CONFIG_ARM_LPAE depend on !CORTEX_A8 && !CORTEX_A9 && !<qualcomm v7
cpus> && !<marvell v7 cpus>. That's also ugly.

Yep, unfortunate.
