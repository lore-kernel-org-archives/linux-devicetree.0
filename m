or as is the "new" practice, you may used SPDX tags

Which other driver would be interested in your CAM implementation except
you. Realistically speaking none, so it is perfectly fine to do so in a
header at a right place!

Unfortunately I am not. As a patch writer you have the onus to explain it to
people who live outside the CAAM world

I prefer none. Make sure the struct instance is not global and allocated in
your driver probe routine.

This would be the right time to explain why. I understand that your subsystem
has tightly coupled DMA but that doesn't really mean the DMA controller should
not have its own IRQ and bh. This makes things harder to review and follow.

Which itself is problematic in first place and no explanation provided on
why. Yes you have a special hardware, so does every second person!

Sorry I am going to refuse to look at other references. A patch should
provide enough explanation on its own for me to review.

Please remove the line, or worst make this debug print

Overall I am not very excited about this implementation. I think things can
be improved and decoupled from crypto driver and things done independently.
If you do so this driver can be reused across different crypto
implementations where you have the same DMA controller.
