This would at least be a somewhat reasonable compromise, if that's your
preference.

However, my proposal had the advantage that potential users of the
platform are *aware* that the DT bindings are in-flux and that they may
change.

With your proposal, there is no such statement, even if we reserve the
right, on case-by-case basis to have a discussion about potentially
breaking the DT bindings.

But if that's OK for you, I'm happy with that as well.

Supporting something has absolutely nothing to do with keeping the DT
bindings unchanged. Supporting something means that I'll watch for
build failures and fix them, I'll watch for bug reports and act on
them, I'll watch on subsystem/infrastructure changes and change my
driver code accordingly. This is what supporting means.

Except if:

 1/ Your final production chip has some differences from your test chip
    which do affect the DT representation. The kernel community has
    asked for years that HW vendors start submitting code as early as
    possible, and they are now doing it. In order to do it as soon as
    possible, they start doing it based on test chips, which may be
    slightly different from the final chips. The kernel community
    should then understand this and be a bit flexible in that the
    kernel support might change a bit, as the HW might change a bit
    before it reaches production.

 2/ You have no documentation for your HW, and you're simply
    discovering how it works progressively. Look at all the folks who
    write nice upstream code solely based on crappy vendor BSPs, with
    no datasheet whatsoever. Do you think they can sanely have a good
    overall understanding of the HW from day 1 ? Certainly not. They
    will discover that such or such HW block is not only a timer, but
    also a watchdog. That this other HW block not only contains
    clocks, but reset and pinctrl lines.

I don't like to self-promote my own stuff, but I think you should read
the slides of my talk "Device Tree as a stable ABI: a fairy
tale" (http://free-electrons.com/pub/conferences/2015/elc/petazzoni-dt-as-stable-abi-fairy-tale/petazzoni-dt-as-stable-abi-fairy-tale.pdf).
I will clearly not suggest you to watch the video recording, as I don't
want you to suffer from one hour of my terrible English accent.

So you like to have tons and tons of essentially dead code to parse old
versions of DT bindings?

What really strikes me here is that the Linux kernel always had a
version strong position, detailed in
Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt, that the kernel developers don't
want to maintain a stable API for kernel modules, because keeping old
APIs around means keeping old code, that isn't tested, confuses people,
etc. Read the file if you've never done so.

And now, for something pretty much as complicated (if not more) as the
kernel module API, the DT bindings, you want to do *exactly* what this
stable_api_nonsense.txt says we shouldn't do ?

See above: the HW has changed, or the HW is not working as it was
originally understood when the DT binding was initially designed.

Irrelevant: the distro shall just ship with all the Device Trees for
all supported platforms, and that's it. Exactly like the x86 kernels
shipped by distros have essentially all kernel drivers enabled in order
to be able to have a kernel that works on all platforms.

Same, irrelevant: the DTB comes with the distro kernel package, and like
kernel modules, they are installed in a per-kernel version directory.

Exactly like they have to change their kernel modules so that they are
compatible with the kernel version they run.

Those hypervisors, bootloaders or system-level should not hardcode the
platform DTB, but simply use the one that is provided together with the
kernel.
