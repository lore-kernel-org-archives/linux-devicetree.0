But the video driver does not know what I2C *bus* it's on.  I have been unable to come up with a way to obtain the proper i2c_adapter object to use when looking for EDID data.

I tried adding a call to i2c_add_driver() in my framebuffer driver, but the I2C probe function was called *after* the framebuffer's probe function, so that doesn't help me.

I don't know how to do that, either.

I'm always in favor of doing things the simpler way.
