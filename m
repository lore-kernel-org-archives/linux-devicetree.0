Uhm, OK, sounds good. Except you must know the whole mapping in advance. 
Fair enough.
Would that work without the whole mbus driver (I guess Ezequiel's)?
I'm dealing with 3.10.

Where does the 0x82000000 come from?
What about the 0x1 (second cell)?

By "single" you mean that it's just *one* range, right?

Uhm... why? And how? You mean dynamically upgrading the ranges window?

Aren't in this case the two regions aliased? Shouldn't the fourth column 
on either row be 0x00000000? Like:

     ranges = <0x00000000  0x82000000 0x00000000 0x00000000  0x8000000 
//  BAR 0
               0x10000000  0x82000000 0x00000000 0x08000000  0x8000000> 
// BAR 1

Now I completely lost you. According to the above description (BTW, I 
like the double space to separate groups -- it makes this whole mess a 
little messy!) the child address should have a single cell.
Why use two then?

Right.

Sorry for being pedantic, but I'd really like to get this straight once 
and for all...

Thanks again,
