Even if there were an overlap, I'd say let the best test harness win.
Just as we have different LSMs that do something similar.

But this is not about that though. Although both are testing code,
they do so in *very* different ways.

The design philosophy and architecture are fundamentally different. The
*only* thing I can think of where there is overlap is that both can test
similar code paths. Beyond that, the layout of how one itemizes tests
could be borrowed, but that would be up to each kselftest author to
decide, in fact some ksefltests do exist which follow similar pattern of
itemizing test cases and running them. Kunit just provides a proper
framework to do this easily but also with a focus on UML. This last
aspect makes kselftests fundamentally orthogonal from an architecture /
design perspective.

After careful review, I cannot personally identify what could be shared
at this point. Can you? If you did identify one part, how do you
recommend to share it?
