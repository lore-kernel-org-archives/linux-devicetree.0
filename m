I guess we could indeed use this technique for almost anything.

I think the main argument to call it pinctrl/pinmux still is to provide
some named API and reason for drivers to invoke when they wanted to make
use of the feature.

In other words, it's pretty easy to see why and when a driver would
invoke a pin control API to configure the HW surrounding the HW module
that driver controls. If we don't call that pinctrl, what else might we
call it? That said, I'm sure we can come up with some reasonable more
general-purpose name.

Certainly, yes.

I think anything beyond a simple linear list of register writes would
get a /lot/ of pushback. See for example Grant's comments in one of the
links I referenced:

http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/linux/kernel/1305624

about delays in the PHY initialization sequence being "right out".

I can imagine the data including flags like 8/16/32/64-bit register
accesses, or read-modify-write vs. just write (i.e. do we need to
include a mask or not) being reasonable, but any state, looping, delay,
conditionals etc. being nak'd. Otherwise, we'd be inventing a byte code
interpreter instead of just a list of register writes. If we /did/ want
to go that route (and I suspect there's no need...) then I think we'd
want to re-use some existing byte code definition rather than creating a
new one.

Yes, the loss of semantics also doesn't entirely appeal to me. However,
I wonder if the other advantages don't outweigh that.
