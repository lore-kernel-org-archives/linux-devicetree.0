Just to confirm, instead of SoC-specific glue driver, dwc3-of-simple.c
should handle compatible "foo", right?

I also don't think that dwc3/core.c should have any SoC-specific controls.
I've thought the SoC-specific glue driver (dwc3-***.c) calls "clocks",
"resets", and "regulators".

However, although dwc3-of-simple.c can handle "clocks", it can't handle
"resets" and "regulators". Who should call them?

Thank you,
