In this case, the _regulator_get_voltage() call can succeed, but only
after a voltage is explicitly requested from the framework side.  The
intention here would then be to call _regulator_do_set_voltage() with the
constraint min_uV to max_uV range.  After that, subsequent
_regulator_get_voltage() calls will be successful.

Here is the general idea:

diff --git a/drivers/regulator/core.c b/drivers/regulator/core.c
index 65f9b7c..e61983d 100644
--- a/drivers/regulator/core.c
+++ b/drivers/regulator/core.c
@@ -910,6 +910,19 @@ static int machine_constraints_voltage(struct
regulator_dev *rdev,
 	    rdev->constraints->min_uV && rdev->constraints->max_uV) {
 		int target_min, target_max;
 		int current_uV = _regulator_get_voltage(rdev);
+		if (current_uV == -EAGAIN) {
+			/*

+			_regulator_do_set_voltage(rdev,
+						  rdev->constraints->min_uV,
+						  rdev->constraints->max_uV);
+			current_uV = _regulator_get_voltage(rdev);
+		}
 		if (current_uV < 0) {
 			rdev_err(rdev,
 				 "failed to get the current voltage(%d)\n",

Do you still have reservations about using -EAGAIN for this purpose?  If
so, which error code would you suggest using?

Thanks,
David
