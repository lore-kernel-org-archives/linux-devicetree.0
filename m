Benoit,

Please try to avoid top-posting.  I've re-flowed it, below.

Arnd, Andrew, question for both of you below.

Ignore what I said before about the patch.  It doesn't apply to your
board.  We need to fix the quirk to trigger on SoC revision, not board
compatible, as it currently does.

The only outstanding point (Arnd?), is that I think it's ok to have the
i2c...a0 compatible string in the dts files, but Andrew seems to think
otherwise.  Is that still true Andrew?

Hopefully, we'll hear from one of them today, and we can merge your
patch as-is with the minor comment reformatting.

thx,

Jason.
