I had wondered about that, but afaiu psci is a smc interface, and I
would assume bootloader drops you out of secure mode before entering
the kernel or whatever comes after first stage bootloader if you are
chain-loading?  So wasn't sure even how that could work..   (ofc, well
outside of my areas so I could be quite off base)

If there is a workaround, then I am much less concerned, and would
rather talk about that :-)

Sure.. just trying to make sure the wrong people don't end up being
the ones that suffer.  I would assume/expect that it is at least
possible for qcom to change firmware/bootloader for their dev boards
and future devices and whatnot, whether they grumble about it or not.
But I guess most of what the general public has are devices w/ signed
fw, which is why "go fix your firmware" is an option that sets off
alarm bells for me.

I guess the first device where this will matter to me and a large
group of community folks would be the dragonboard 410c..  *hopefully*
it does not require signed firmware or at least qcom could make
available signed firmware which supports psci..
