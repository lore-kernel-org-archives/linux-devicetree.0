This patchset replaces existing pinmux framework for SPEAr family of SoC with
generic pinctrl framework.

@Linus: I would need your Acks on it, after which i will take it through ARM-SoC
tree, as it has dependency on that.

V2->V3
- Add DT bindings for pinmux mappings for SPEAr
- Pass pin maps from dtb instead of mach-spear3xx/spear3*0.c files
- use of_iomap() instead of devm_ioremap() and platform_get_resource()

V1->V2
- Earlier padmux support removed
- single patch for spear pinctrl drivers broken into two: one for spear and
  other for 3xx family
- add pinctrl support in arch/arm/mach-spear3xx/ and dts files
- pinctrl-spear.* made as library instead of platform driver
- pinctrl-spear300, spear310, spear320 are now platform drivers
- other minor fixes.

Viresh Kumar (4):
  SPEAr: Remove existing padmux support for SPEAr
  pinctrl: Add SPEAr pinctrl drivers
  pinctrl: Add SPEAr3xx pinctrl drivers
  SPEAr3xx: Add pinctrl support for boards
