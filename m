This patch enables a PiFi DAC+ V2.0, which is a PCM5122-based audio
output DAC add-on board for the Raspberry Pi B+ and later, connected
to the GPIO header of the Bananapi M3 via jumper cables. The power,
ground, and I2C pins are in the same position, but the I2S ones are
not.

The I2C controller used is I2C2, while the I2S controller is I2S1.

I'm sure I've asked this before, and IIRC the answer was yes: The I2C
controllers available on the GPIO header all have proper, always-on,
external pull-ups. Does that mean we can enable them by default, seeing
as they are likely intended to be used this way (as I2C pins)?

I think we have a few boards where either I2C or UARTs on the GPIO
header are enabled by default.
