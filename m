This series has been rebased but its content has not changed.

This is series has two parts.  The first two patches are changes
to the existing Broadcom Kona family clock code to prepare for the
addition of support for another SoC, bcm21664.

The remaining three define the binding and code for bcm21664, and
replace the use of "fake" clocks in the device tree with the real
ones.  This ends up being a fairly straightforward definition of
the clocks on this SoC; the rest of the clock code is shared with
other SoCs that use the Kona style clock system.

This series depends on a number of other things that are
currently queued for Linux 3.15 or have already been sent
out for review:
    - Clock support for bcm281xx and initial BCM21664 support,
      all queued for 3.15:
        https://github.com/broadcom/mach-bcm/
	    armsoc/for-3.15/cleanup
	    armsoc/for-3.15/drivers
	    armsoc/for-3.15/dt
	    armsoc/for-3.15/soc-3
    - Additional clock fixes and features for bcm281xx (out for review)
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/4/1/876
This prerequisite code appears in the branch (below) as merges
from other publicly-available git branches where available, or
cherry-picks otherwise.

This code is available in the "review/bcm21664-clock-rebased" branch
of the git repository here:
