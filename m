The HHI register region provides more than just clocks. Several drivers may
need to access this region, such as the clock controllers and the display
driver.

Meson-gx clock controllers has been developed and merged before we knew the
hhi could be needed elsewhere, which is why it requests the region directly.
Meson-axg was built following the model of meson-gx.

To fix this situation, the clock controller should be a child of the hhi
system controllers. The hhi system controller node already exists on meson-gx.
It needs to be added on the axg.

This changeset depends on [0]. This dependency has been merged in
clk-next. A topic branch is available here [1]

  dt-bindings: clock: meson: update documentation with hhi syscon
  ARM64: dts: meson-gx: sysctrl is the parent of the clock controller
  ARM64: dts: meson-axg: use hhi syscon for the clock controller
  ARM64: dts: meson-gx: fix gxl clock controller compatible
