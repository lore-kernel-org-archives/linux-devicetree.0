Which clock are you talking about? MCLK? This seems to be fed directly from
the CCU, as there doesn't seem to be controls for it within the CSI hardware
block, and the diagram doesn't list it either. IMO you don't have to model it.
The camera sensor device node would just take a reference to it directly. You
would probably enable the (separate) pinmux setting in the CSI controller node.
