This was done so that we can remove the secure_flush mechanism, as we are the
only consumer (that I could find).  Using the DMA APIs would match the scm-64 so
it would be symmetric.  I'll add this to the commit message to give more reason
why the changes are being made.

If it was used in more than one function, yes.  But I felt that single use
functions were kind of a waste.  But this is in the eye of the beholder.

Ok.  I'll run that and see how it turns out.

Fair point.  I hadn't considered that.  Thanks for catching that.

Yes I was going to do a follow on to remove that.  I opted to not add this to
the set of patches.

If we needed access to something in the scm other than the device, yes.  If we
passed scm instead, we might be able to remove the singleton usage.  I'll look
and see if it makes sense.  Otherwise i'd leave the passing of the device.
