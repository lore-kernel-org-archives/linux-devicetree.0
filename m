It could be that "flash-leds" will remain the only one. Depending on
whether anyone would ever want to support a Xenon flash in which case we
could add a property for "flash-xenon" or such. Quite possibly not; LEDs
have improved in luminosity a lot over the recent years and aren't that far
from tiny Xenon flash devices. I don't remember seeing a mobile phone less
than five years or so with a Xenon flash.

trigger-sources is not really the same thing: it's present in the LED node,
not in the sensor to start with. The LED driver has no knowledge of the
Media device --- the sensor driver gains this information through the
endpoints. The sensor driver would need to find the node which contains a
phandle back to the sensor node.

Having this property in the sensor gives the association information
between the sensor and the LED. It could be present elsewhere, e.g. the
master device with DMA engines if there's no association with a sensor.

Some sensors do support strobing the flash, too. The flash type (Xenon or
LED) needs to be known to the strobe source (sensor).

The strobe wiring may not be there: the module vendors often omit that. Or
it could be omitted on the board. That's the case with LED flashes; they
can mostly be triggered using I²C as well albeit less precisely.
