I don't know if we need to define the constraints the PMIC itself
has. Aren't these already defined in the driver?

What I meant was that it's not unreasonable to assume that most boards
using axp209 will follow the reference design, so dcdc2 powers the cpu,
dcdc3 powers the rest of the internal logic and dll, and ldo3 powers
avcc. And we could possibly put the the SoC constraints for these in
axp209.dtsi. Maybe except vcc-cpu, which is different across sun[457]i.
