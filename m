In that case, that just "won't happen" because the soc driver is a very
soc specific driver only used for this device tree. We it will always
bind to that high level soc node.

There is a reason: We don't describe the hardware with it...

The cfg0/cfg1 register which Sanchayan needs to read in the soc bus
driver are just two register with a unique ID of the SoC. In whatever
driver throughout the system we use that ID (e.g. in a random generator
for initialization) we never describe an actual hardware relation... Its
just software and how we use that unique ID. The device tree is ment to
describe hardware. Hence the NVMEM consumer binding is not suited for
such NVMEM cells...

By describing the NVMEM cells location in device tree (producer API, the
NVMEM cells are in hardware at that location, so using the device tree
for that part is fine) and hard coding the NVMEM cell we need in the
driver code we don't violate the device tree matra "describe the
hardware"...

Looking-up the nodes direcly is what Rob suggested here:

If you can provide a solution acceptable by the device tree folks and
works without this patch, I am happy to do it...

Btw, I am not entirely happy with the API name, but did not had a better
idea... And we we should probably add a note that the device tree
consumer binding is the preferred way to do it.
