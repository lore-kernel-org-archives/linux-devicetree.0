Last time I checked, clkdev API neither implements referencing nor
unregister. This is on Mike's list and IIRC there already has been
a proposal for unregister. Si5351 was the first clkdev driver ever
that could possibly be unloaded, so there may be still some features
missing.

Good point, first I thought always disable on last user dropping it but
that may most likely break some platforms. Second thought, get back to
the state when the driver was loaded.

True, wrong clock will most likely not work on all monitors or TV. My
impression for TVs is that the the "cheaper" the brand is, the more
likely they accept any mode/clock combination ;)

Also: audio/video clock relation is sent in AVI packets over HDMI.
Picking a clock with 11% off may not even allow you to send (valid) CTS
information.

+1 for using marvell,armada-510-lcd. I like the nick-name "dove" but
armada-510 is much easier to find on Marvell's website.
