As you see right now there is separation already.

I am not fully convinced about it. Bootloader can set it up but there
shouldn't be dependency on bootloader capability that it will do it.
Also you don't need to use fully featured bootloader for doing that.
It means that for board dtses make sense to fill memory node with
correct values. If bootloader is capable to rewrite it/fix it, then it
is fine. If not, you can use let's say default values.

Also the second part of the problem is. You have bootloader which is
aware about that you have 34GB of memory in two banks. 2GB below 4GB
limit and 32GB above. But if bootloader starts to rewrite memory node
where #size-cell = <1> with 32GB size it will probably messes it up.

That's why I see the value to setup size-cells = <2>; earlier rather
than later.
IRC someone mentioning that in past when I was pushing zynqmp DTS that
we should use #size-cells = <2>;

ok. Fair enough. I need this for at least memory node because boards are
using the same zynqmp.dtsi files. For all other buses I have no problem
to keep just size-cells = <1>; and setup ranges to make dtc happy.

Thanks,
Michal
