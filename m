I applied a patch that did exactly that (109b623629), and then reverted
it (b920ecc82) shortly thereafter because add_device_randomness() is
a rather slow function and FDTs can get large. I'd like to see someone
do a reasonable analysis on the cost of using an FDT for randomness
before I reapply a patch doing something similar. An awful lot of the
FDT data is not very random, but there are certainly portions of it that
are appropriate for the random pool.
