There are couple of checkpatch errors that show up. The compatible
"lego,ev3" needs to be documented in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/davinci.txt

"at24,24c128" is undocumented. Is that an atmel chip on the EV3? If the
manufacturer name is not clear,
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/eeprom/eeprom.txt advises using just
"24c128"

Finally, lego needs to be added to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/vendor-prefixes.txt

Can you please submit the documentation portions as separate patches in
a series along with this patch.

Thanks,
Sekhar
