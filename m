This patch series adds PCIe legacy interrupt (INTx) support to the iProc
PCIe driver by modeling it with its own IRQ domain. All 4 interrupts INTA,
INTB, INTC, INTD share the same interrupt line connected to the GIC
in the system. This is now modeled by using its own IRQ domain.

Also update all relevant devicetree files to adapt to the new model

This patch series is available on GIHUB:
repo: https://github.com/Broadcom/arm64-linux.git
branch: pcie-intx-v1
