Right, I brought up AXI because it is public, well documented and easy
to talk about - every bus/interconnect (PCI, PCI-E, RapidIO,
HyperTransport, etc) I've ever seen works in essentially the same way
- links and 'switches'.

The main issue seems to be how to do merge the DT standard CPU-centric
tree with a bus graph that isn't CPU-centric - eg like in that Zynq
diagram I mentioned.

All the existing DT cases I'm aware of are able to capture the DMA bus
topology within the CPU tree - because they are the same :)

So, my attempt was to sketch a vertex list and adjacency matrix in DT.

'axi' is the container for the graph, 'axi_switch' is a vertex and
then 'downstream' encodes the adjacency list.

We can't use the natural DT tree hierarchy here because there is no
natural graph root - referring to the Zynq diagram there is no vertex
you can start at and then reach every other vertex - so a tree can't
work, and there is no such thing as a 'bus level'

The DAG would only have vertexes for switches and distinct vertexes
for 'end-ports'. So if an IP block has a master interface and a slave
interface then it would have two DAG end-port vertexes and the DAG can
remain acyclic.

The only way to create cycles is to connect switches in loops, and you
can always model a group of looped switches as a single switch vertex
to remove cycles.

If cycles really are required then it just makes the kernel's job
harder, it doesn't break the DT representation ..

Right, the DT, and the 'reg' properties should present a tree that is
the MMIO path for the CPU. That tree should be a subset of the full
bus graph.

If the bus is 'sane' then that tree matches the DMA graph as well,
which is where most implementations are today.

I choose to talk about this as a side table for a few reasons (touched
on above) but perhaps the most important is where do you put switches
that the CPU's MMIO path doesn't flow through? What is the natural
place in the DT tree?

Again refering to the Zynq diagram, you could have a SOC node like
this:

soc
{
  // Start at Cortex A9
  scu {
     OCM {}
     l2cache {
             memory {}
	     slave {
	     	   on_chip0 {reg = {}}
	     	   on_chip1 {reg = {}}
	     	   on_chip2 {reg = {}}
		   ...
	     }
     }
  }
}

Where do I put a node for the 'memory interconnect' switch? How do I
model DMA connected to the 'Cache Coherent AXI port'?

MMIO config registers for these blocks are going to fit into the MMIO
tree someplace, but that doesn't really tell you anything about how
they fit into the dma graph.

Easy to do with a side table:
axi {
    cpu {downstream = scu}
    scu {downstream = OCM,l2cache}
    l2cache {downstream = memory,slave interconnect}
    slave interconnect {} // No more switches

    hp axi {downstream = memory interconnect}
    memory interconnect {downstream = memory,OCM}
    
    coherent acp {downstream = scu}

    gp axi  {downstream = master interconnect}
    master interconnect  {downstream = central interconnect}
    central interconnect  {downstream = ocm,slave interconnect,memory}

    dma engine  {downstream = central interconnect}
}

Which captures the switch vertex list and adjacency list.

Then you have to connect the device nodes into the AXI graph:

Perhaps:

on_chip0
{ 
   reg = {}
   axi_mmio_slave_port = <&slave interconnect, M0> // Vertex and edge
   axi_bus_master_port = <&hp axi, S1>
}

Or maybe back reference from the graph table is better:

axi {
   hp axi {
       downstream = memory interconnect
       controller = &...;
       S1 {
          bus_master = &on_chip0;   // Vertex and edge
       	  axi,arbitration-priority = 10;
       }
   }
   slave interconnect {
       M0 {
          mmio_slave = &on_chip0;
       }
   }
}

It sort of feels natural that you could describe the interconnect in
under its own tidy node and the main tree remains left alone...

This might be easier to parse as well, since you know everything under
'axi' is related to interconnect and not jumbled with other stuff.

Cheers,
Jason
