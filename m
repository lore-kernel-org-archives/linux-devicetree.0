Ok got it. As enabling all interrupts by default does not influence
DMA behavior I will remove these inputs from DT.
Thanks for this explanation.

After quick search I don't find any other DMA controller that handles
this problematic.
For sure, there is no way to handle it thanks to dmaengine API.

Then, I know that previously many DMA clients could pass specific
information during channel request thanks to *fn_param as below:
struct dma_chan *__dma_request_channel(const dma_cap_mask_t *mask,
dma_filter_fn fn, void *fn_param)
But now, this API seems obsolete has new platform has to request
channel thanks to DT inputs via dma_request_slave_channel(struct
device *dev, const char *name) API.
In that way, all specific information has to be retrieved from DT.

Same remark as above

Same remark as above. We abolutely need to retrieve it from DT.
Moreover, this point really influence DMA controller behavior in term
of performance.

As other interrupt configuration, I will remove it from DT.

Thanks,
