Ok. I've dropped the cache part from this patch. I left the example as
is minus the cache-level attribute.

Understanding how the cache-level value would be used might help. I
wonder if the cache-level can just be a number that describes the
largest value that the cache could be assigned. Then if you have
different CPUs seeing different levels of cache they can traverse from
their CPU node to the cache and count how many phandles they went through.
