The reason for aligning all exynos5250 .dts files was to be able to use
diff -u to compare files for differences. Obviously the board compatible
will always show up, but by ordering alphabetically and by inheriting
some common order for the other nodes without particular convention only
the actual changes show up. That's why I had started the voluntary work
of also cleaning up boards that I do not have access to. You had already
adopted alphabetical order for Vim, thanks for that.

Basically we have two different concepts here:
One is physical reuse, e.g., the boards all use the same S905 chip from
Amlogic, so we can safely inherit meson-gxbb.dtsi.
The other is design reuse. Rather than reusing the same physical board,
they are different boards based on a common template but they may
contain variations. Thus there is no guarantee that everything in the
original template is in each derived board. The difficulty for us here
is that for most TV boxes no schematics are available to decide whether
there are any differences compared to Amlogic's P/Q reference boards. So
we would only find out when something breaks.

For example, continuing my work on the NanoPi K2 I have found several
minor variations of how power supplies are called and which GPIO is
being used, compared to Odroid-C2 or Vega.

Therefore the usual solution is that contributors of individual board
trees also need to maintain them long-term, as opposed to expecting
BayLibre to do that and magically getting everything for free.
Specifically, I added the vega-s95 and am adding the nanopi-k2, so once
you add serdev and Bluetooth nodes for your Vim, we will have to
manually adopt those for other boards. If we don't notice or don't do
our additions, the boards will continue to boot as before but just not
get any new cool features. On the other hand, if some driver change gets
performed, all in-tree files need to be updated, which provides some
more motivation for vendors and users to participate in mainline
development.

Being the Amlogic maintainer is not an "accusation".

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/arch/arm64/boot/dts/amlogic/meson-gxl-s905x-khadas-vim.dts?id=e15d2774b8c096f116bf7192b37e8652da71369e

carries his Signed-off-by, that's for a fact.

Also FTR I found it a really weird assumption that ugly naming should be
noticed during RC testing. Therefore my point that this is about review,
not testing.

Fact is also that BayLibre people appear to be working on Amlogic stuff
during the week and with few exceptions unlike you and me are rather
silent the weekend, which is when I get to look into these platforms. So
whatever their formula of payment may be (I don't care), they seem to
have more time to spend on this as part of their job. Me, I am not a
kernel developer in my day job. So telling a hobbyist contributor to do
their job is really off.

Thanks for catching that. Note that you may have some more letter twists
in your cover letter.
