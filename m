That's the interrupt number as exposed by the GIC HW (see the GICv3
specification).

Something like that. Or you could make it easy for whoever is writing
the DT and adopt the same convention as the GIC itself, exposing the SPI
number on its own.

The convention for these register offsets is to write something like:

	writel_relaxed(val, base + REG_OFFSET + reg);

which makes it clear what this offset is. I'm happy for you to keep it
around if you write it in a similar way.

Fair enough.

That'd be fine indeed.

I think that would indeed make it obvious that you do not intend to
support multiple of these. And maybe simplify the name to "AIDET", as
"UniPhier AIDET" is quite large in /proc/interrupts...
