The Linux code in drivers/mtd/maps/physmap_of.c will optionally
look for the linux,part-probe binding for hints on a partition type to
look for in the MTD. It was added in commit 9d5da3a9b849
"mtd: extend physmap_of to let the device tree specify the parition probe"

This solution is too Linux-specific and depend on some
Linux kernel-internal naming conventions. We need a proper
way of describing partition types that follow the pattern set by
other device tree bindings.

Create a "partition-type" binding for this, and add "my" bindings
for "arm,arm-flash-structure" as a starter for others to follow.
A follow-on patch adds support to the Linux kernel to handle this
binding, with some infrastructure for others to use it too.

 Representing flash partitions in devicetree
 
-Partitions can be represented by sub-nodes of an mtd device. This can be used
-on platforms which have strong conventions about which portions of a flash are
-used for what purposes, but which don't use an on-flash partition table such
-as RedBoot.
+On-device partition types:
+
+It is possible for some drivers to indicate an on-device partition type, i.e.
+partition tables, footers or other binary pattern in the flash used to
+define how the flash is partitioned. This can be done in the device tree node
+of an MTD device by specifying partition-type = "foo"; This tells the operating
+system to look for the partition type indicated.
+
+Required properties:
+- partition-type : the type of partition. Only one type can be specified.
+  Valid types are:
+  "arm,arm-flash-structure" (also called AFS)
+
+Example:
+
+flash0@40000000 {
+	/* 2 * 32MiB NOR Flash memory */
+	compatible = "arm,vexpress-flash", "cfi-flash";
+	partition-type = "arm,arm-flash-structure";
+	reg = <0x40000000 0x04000000>;
+	bank-width = <4>;
+};
+
+
+Device Tree specified partitions:
+
+If there is no specified on-device binary format, partitions can be
+represented by sub-nodes of an mtd device. This can be used on platforms which
+have strong conventions about which portions of a flash are used for what
+purposes.
+
 NOTE: if the sub-node has a compatible string, then it is not a partition.
 
 #address-cells & #size-cells must both be present in the mtd device. There are
