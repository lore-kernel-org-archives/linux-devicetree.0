The DT controls this in so far as it will arrange for the bias to be
connected to something, if it's not connected to anything then it will
only be turned on if the machine driver explicitly forces it on which is
a potential source of problems but seems comfortably in "you broke it,
you get to keep the pieces" territory.  If we really want to have a way
of explicitly specifying that some widgets should never be turned on
then it feels like rather than have something device and widget specific
like this we should instead have a higher level way of doing that which
can be applied to any widget, that is something that could be useful
especially with things like speaker drivers where there's real potential
for physical damage to the system.

Like I said in my original reply I'm also worried that this will break
existing boards by causing them to change to a voltage of 0 when they
had managed to end up with the default of 2V which happened to work for
them.
