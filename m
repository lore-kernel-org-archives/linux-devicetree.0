I'm not sure the compatible is really needed.

A label of some sort, just like the MTD partitions do would do just
fine, and wouldn't have the implicit expectation that a driver will be
probed from that node.

Oh, so you'd like to infer the data format it's stored in from the
compatible?

AFAICT, this format will be highly depending on the board itself,
rather than on the SoC, do you think it will scale enough?

Hmmmm, apparently you don't :)

I'm half convinced that the layout information will actually work for
more complex cases, like the linked list Rob described.

If such a structure is ever to be found, it would feel wrong to have
that in the EEPROM driver, but it would feel just as wrong to put that
in the client driver, that would have to handle the parsing of raw
data coming flashed by one single crazy board vendor.

Maybe we can have each cell carry a property that defines the format
it's stored in, and match that to some parsers plugins, starting with
the generic and trivial cases but still allowing for custom parsers to
be defined?

Something like

eeprom@42 {
	compatible =3D "atmel,at24something";
	reg =3D <0x42>;

	serial@0 {
		label =3D "board serial";
		reg =3D <0x0 0x10>;
		format =3D "packed";
	};

	opps@10 {
		label =3D "board serial";
		reg =3D <0x10 0x10>, <0x40 0x10>, <0x80 0x10>;
		format =3D "random-vendor,opp-linked-list";
	};
};

That would make eeprom_read always return the same format of data to
the client drivers, without cripling the generic EEPROM drivers
either.
