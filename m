The description string should specify the general name of what this is
suspporting.  Right now, with these patches, it would list

  Qualcomm MSM (Flattened Device Tree)

twice as the two targets we support (and isn't helpful when you see
which one it picks).  I'd put the "MSM" name by itself without
thinking about it too much.  It wasn't that confusing, since there was
only one at the time.

Perhaps make the 8660 one "Qualcomm MSM8660 (Flattened Device Tree)"
and the 8960 one "Qualcomm MSM8960 (Flattened Device Tree)"

I realize that the chip numbers are a bit confusing, so probably best
to pick a canonical name for the description.
