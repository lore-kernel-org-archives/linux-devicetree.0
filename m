Hmm. I have to admit I missed this one.

Well, I guess that this feature depends on the user making sure there are
no references to the tables that are to be removed, as there is no
refcounting. Let me know if I'm missing something, but nothing appears to
prevent releasing nodes that are in use.

If that is really so, then refcounting or another mechanism to achieve
something similar should be added to make removal safe, but this isn't
related to printing the node names anymore nor such fixes belong to this
patchset.
