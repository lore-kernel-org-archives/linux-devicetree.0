Hi Andy,

Thanks for the comments.

For code that is used on both OF and ACPI based systems, I think so. But if
you have something that is only used on OF, %pOF is better --- it has more
functionality that seems quite OF specific. In general I think the ability
to print a node's full name is way more important on OF. On ACPI you don't
need it so often --- which is probably the reason it hasn't been supported.

Good question. The swnodes have no hierarchy at the moment (they're only
created for a struct device as a parent) and they do not have human-readable
names. So I'd say it's not relevant right now. Should these two change,
support for swnode could (and should) be added later on.

This bit has been actually adopted from the OF counterpart. If there are
improvements in this area, then I'd just change both at the same time.

I guess it's a matter of expectations. :-) Again this works the same way
than the OF counterpart. Right now there's little to print (just the name
and the full name), but if support is added for more, then this mechanism is
fully relevant again.

The alternative would be to remove that now and add it back if it's needed
again. I have a slight preference towards keeping it extensible (i.e. as
it's now).
