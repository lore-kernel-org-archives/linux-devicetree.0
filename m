I sent a patch that takes the .oper_speed out completely and only applies it for the ACPI based devices where we know that it works.

Once Loic’s resends the patches we can get them into bluetooth-next and start merging these towards upstream. After that, Bluetooth should work just out of the box like with any USB dongle.

that means adding something like this will silence it.

+#define BCM_RECV_NULL \
+       .type = 0x00, \
+       .hlen = 0, \
+       .loff = 0, \
+       .lsize = 0, \
+       .maxlen = 0
+
+static int bcm_recv_null(struct hci_dev *hdev, struct sk_buff *skb)
+{
+       kfree_skb(skb);
+       return 0;
+}
+
 static const struct h4_recv_pkt bcm_recv_pkts[] = {
        { H4_RECV_ACL,      .recv = hci_recv_frame },
        { H4_RECV_SCO,      .recv = hci_recv_frame },
        { H4_RECV_EVENT,    .recv = hci_recv_frame },
        { BCM_RECV_LM_DIAG, .recv = hci_recv_diag  },
+       { BCM_RECV_NULL,    .recv = bcm_recv_null  },
 };

It does silence it indeed. Maybe this is some of their markers to ensure that the baud rate change worked. Or it is the indication that the reset completed. Do you happen to know between which commands we receive it?

> Regarding the speed, I'm unable to reach 3Mbps, I selected 921600 because this is the baudrate used by raspbian bt script.

That is the same I experienced. The 921600 works fine, but trying 3Mbps doesn’t. However it seems with hciattach you can crank it up to 3Mpbs somehow. Maybe the delay is just to short for the UART switching in that case.

> Maybe they had some issues at higher speed (empirical value ?), However 2Mbps seems ok on my side (need to double check/adjust).

We have to make it a DT max-speed param anyway. So I am not that worried.

Eric, any chance you can dig out the recommendation for the Bluetooth controller usage? I would also like to see the recommended PCM settings for this hardware. It bet it is somehow wired up to the sound controller.
