Yes

Some FPGA use cases already have a base bridge per FPGA that could
serve as this bus.  But this use case has a static FPGA image +
reprogrammable child fpga regions.  There's no base bridge under Linux
since the FPGA was programmed and the bridge enabled before Linux
boots.   An added base bridge that doesn't touch hardware will be
required for this type of use.

Thanks for the feedback.
