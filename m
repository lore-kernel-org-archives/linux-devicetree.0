Hi Alex,

Can you comment on my diff above? I basically tossed up some pseudo-code
to show how clk_enable calls can be nested inside of each other. I'd
like to know if that approach makes sense for your prereq clocks case.

Note that Linux device drivers that consume leaf clocks do NOT need to
know about the prereq clocks. All of that prereq clock knowledge is
stored in the .enable callback for the leaf clock (see above).

Regards,
Mike
