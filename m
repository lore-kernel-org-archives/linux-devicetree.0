Will fix it.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I am subscribed to the mailing
list however this skipped me.

I too think that should be built-in. Did not have an intention of making
it tristate, however while using other drivers as references, the perhaps
unneccessary stuff crept in.

The MODULE_* references can be removed along with the corresponding header
file. However that series has not been merged yet, so I can't use builtin_*
yet?

@Arnd

Are you ok with the patch in general? I can take care of the above changes
and send a new version. And once the builtin_driver stuff gets merged, I
can send a minor patch to change this module one to builtin?

Regards,
Sanchayan.
