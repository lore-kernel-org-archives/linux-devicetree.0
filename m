Where do you see an issue? Since panel is RGB it should have no
initialization sequence (beside regulator/gpio power on/off), so the
only thing to do is to figure out which regulators/gpios belongs to
which component - with publicly available specs it should be doable.

The whole initialization sequence is for the bridge, so you put it into
bridge driver, for starters it can be hardcoded.

Then you can:

1. Try to find other users of this ICN6211 chip and compare
initialization sequences to guess purpose of registers.

2. Try to get specs of the chip (ask vendor, distributor, grep Internet).

3. Do nothing - if there will be other users of the bridge they will do
this work.
