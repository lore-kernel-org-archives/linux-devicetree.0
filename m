Hi Maxime,

Now that we have support for both PMICs, we can turn on the
regulators needed for the onboard WiFi chips.

This is a fairly simple series. The WiFi chips themselves are
supported by the brcmfmac driver, but the user needs to get an
nvram.txt file and put it in their firmware directory, in
addition to the firmware file in linux-firmware. Otherwise we
just need to enable the mmc controller and supply the vmmc and
vqmmc regulators.


Regards
ChenYu
