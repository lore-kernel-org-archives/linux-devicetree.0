New series was posted week ago https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/11/21/182
"[PATCH v2 00/10] Reuse davinci-nand driver for Keystone arch"

Now we will need to remove one patch form it, which will go alone
as discussed - no other comments were provided.

Patch:
 "[PATCH v2 09/10] mtd: nand: davinci: don't set timings if AEMIF is used"

replaced by:
 https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/11/27/256
 "[PATCH v2] ARM: davinci: aemif: get rid of davinci-nand driver dependency on aemif"
