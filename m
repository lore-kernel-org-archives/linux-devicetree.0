Russel,

that is the plan and that's why the whole patch set is preliminary.
Maybe it would have been more precise to call it RFC instead.

Exactly, and that is what I am looking into right now. But hell, I am
not an expert in linux irq yet. Moreover, I am not even sure if it is
okay to rely on irqdomain or at least irq_data->hw_irq at all.

My current impression is, that generic chip knowns nothing about irq
domains. But my first modification of it was to use irqd_to_hwirq(d)
where ever it uses d->irq instead. This should allow to abstract from
virtual irqs and retain compatibility (_if_ hw_irq is also set on
!CONFIG_IRQ_DOMAIN).

To add more juice: IRQF_VALID and IRQF_PROBE are ARM only flags. I
tried to find out what they are good for, but stopped googl'ing after
a while. (I know you explained that before somewhere)

Yeah, that would be very nice. But the current limitation to one
register set with max 32 irqs of generic chip would still require to
keep a list of primary generic irq chips to flip through in the
irq_handler.

This also raises the question, how to check if an generic irq chip
flow handler has to be called. Current irq_chip_regs don't know nothing
about a cause/status register. And actually you don't even know if it
is high/low active and how to mask it with the high/low active mask
register or mask_cache.
