So my objection here is that by keeping the of_* terms in the driver we
are required to include of, although it does safely convert to returning
NULL if !CONFIG_OF I suppose.

That is correct, in ACPI this would be properly implemented with the
_STA reserved named method. In which case it wouldn't enumerate.
