As long as no one enables both ehci-platform and ehci-ppc-of at the same time
there is no problem. ehci-ppc-of should be removed in favor of ehci-platform
and make sure that the specific quirk in ehci-ppc-of also gets ported, other 
that I see no issue using "usb-ehci" as the least detailed compatible property
name.
