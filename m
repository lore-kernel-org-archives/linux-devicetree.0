I really don't like the idea of introducing drivers/platform/arm/ because
very little of the stuff that one would put in there are actually ARM
specific.

I have suggested a drivers/bus/ before and people did not see the need
back then, and we agreed to continue having a directory for each bus,
as we have for the big ones (pci, usb, i2c, spi, ...) and a lot of
simple (amba, rapidio, bcma, ...) or obscure (tc,  vlynq, nubus, ...)
ones.

I think we should reconsider the idea of drivers/bus/ with a file per
bus in there at least for new buses, but doing a new drivers/scp/
would be ok for me if there is enough opposition against the idea
of drivers/bus aggregating different buses.
