Jisheng,

referring to the sunxi clock related thread, I am glad you finally
picked up the idea of merging clock nodes. Before you start reworking
bg4 clocks, I think I should be a little bit more clear about what I
expect to be the outcome.

When I said "one single clock complex node", I was referring to the
clocks located within the system-controller reg region, i.e. those at
0xea0000. With bg2x we came to the conclusion that those registers
cannot be not cleanly separated by functions, so we decided to have
a single system-controller simple-mfd node with sub-nodes for
pinctrl, clock, reset, and whatever we will find there in the future.

Please also follow this scheme for bg4 because when you start looking
at reset, you'll likely see the same issues we were facing: Either you
have a reset controller node with a plethora of reg property entries
or you constantly undermine the concept of requested resources by using
of_iomap().

Using simple-mfd is a compromise between detailed HW description and
usability. It will also automatically deal with concurrent accesses to
the same register for e.g. clock and reset because simple-mfd and syscon
install an access lock for the reg region. Even though there may be no
real concurrent accesses to the same register, it does no real harm
because we are locking resisters that aren't supposed to be used in
high-speed applications. Some of them are touched once at boot, most
of them are never touched by Linux at all.

For the other PLLs at <0x922000 0x14> and <0x940034 0x14>, I do accept
that they are not part of the system-controller sub-node. For the short
run, I would accept separate nodes for the PLLs alone, but on the long
run they should be hidden within the functional node they belong to,
i.e. mempll should be a clock provided by some memory-controller node.
As soon as you look at power saving modes for the memory-controller,
you would need access to memory-controller register _and_ mempll anyway.

We do have our DT tagged unstable, so we still can easily revert our
limited view of some nodes later.

BTW, if the clock provided by mempll is used to generate peripheral
clocks that are dealt with in the sysctrl clock complex, you should,
of course, expose that relation in DT, e.g.:

sysctrl: system-controller {
	reg = <0xea0700 0xfoo>;

	sysclk: clock {
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clocks = <&osc>, <&memctrl 0>;
		clock-names = "osc", "mempll";
	};
};

memctrl: memory-controller {
	reg = <0x920000 0xbar>;
	/*
	 * clock-cells can also be 0
	 * if there is no other clock provided
	 */
	#clock-cells = <1>;

	clocks = <&osc>;
	clock-names = "osc";
};

some-peripheral: bla {
	clocks = <&sysclk SOME_PERIPHERAL_CLOCK_ID>;
};
