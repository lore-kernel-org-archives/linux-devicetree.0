It's just weird that the arm64 file includes the .dtsi files from arch/arm/
and is then again included back from another file there.

I can see two possible ways to handle this better:

- leave the complete set of bcm2837 files in arch/arm and then have one
  reference from arch/arm64 per .dts that refers to just that file.

- come up with a rule to also build the .dtb files in arch/arm64 when
  we run 'make dtbs' for arch/arm and leave this file there. The argument
  that one could use the same dtb with a 32-bit kernel should basically
  hold true for any arm64 system, it's not specific to rpi-3 really.
  We don't normally test 32-bit kernels on 64-bit SoCs because 64-bit
  kernels are more efficient in a number of ways, and I'm sure there
  are bugs that prevent some systems from working (aside from how some
  machines cannot work because they don't have RAM below 4GB), but if
  this is now something that users are interested in, making it just
  work seems nicer than having a couple of board specific hacks.
