Hi Olof,

Thanks for the comments.  Please see my questions inline before we 
determine what needs to be done for the defconfig patchset.

OK, easy to do.  Are there other files that we need to be aware of that 
have these different requirements to merge as well?

Hi Olof, we can do this.  But this makes bcm_defconfig unusable for us 
in a product and is not a simple configuration to start from for our 
customers.  bcm_defconfig is a different SoC family based around the 
Kona architecture. bcm_defconfig won't be what we build and test on 
Cygnus at all.  There is a script in scripts/kconfig/mergeconfig.pl that 
allows you to merge config files together if you wish to have a kernel 
support multiple SoCs.  I see the same problem with multi_v7_defconfig 
but even worse.  It isn't a configuration we will ever use.  Its only 
purpose seems to be to enable our drivers in the that build just in case 
somebody else happens to break something in the build.

As it stands, multi_v7_defconfig boots noticably slower than 
bcm_cygnus_defconfig.  And, the kernel is larger than we want.  And, the 
kconfigs are more complicated than we need for our boards.  I also 
notice some of the other SoCs families enabled automatically turn on a 
lot of features we don't want on.

Perhaps most of the multi_v7_defconfig merge issue you are facing could 
be solved if you used the mergconfig.pl script to merge multiple 
defconfigs together?

What we wish to do is have a config file that only supports the Cygnus 
family of SoCs.  This allows others to easily see what applies to Cygnus 
without being confused by other configurations.  And, if somebody wishes 
to use scripts/kconfig/mergeconfig.pl to merge different SoC support 
together they are free to do so.

So, we can do as you ask to get this upstreamed.  But it really serves 
little purpose for us other than verifying things build.

Where do we upstream the defconfig that we actually use?  Or is this 
just not done and everyone keeps everything locally and has to continue 
to maintain it there?
