PowerPC has in_le32/out_le32 and variants of those, which unfortunately
are not defined for most other architectures, so you cannot use them
in portable code. They are the same as readl/writel, but without the
PCI error handling.

All combinations of little/big endian CPUs and peripherals have been
done in the past, including peripherals that switch their endianess
dynamically when you change the mode of the CPU, and those that come
with an extra register to add byte-swapping for operating systems
that don't deal with it.

It's all a big mess and there is no good solution that anyone has
managed to come with to cover all possibilities. My recommendation
is generally to use the little-endian accessors when they work,
and have your bus-specific or driver-specific wrapper around those
when the endianess is not always the same.
