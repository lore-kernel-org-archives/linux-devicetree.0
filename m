OK, but I'm guessing that they're using the same IP that is in other
SoCs which do have the DSP so even if you don't care for this device it
might still be an issue.

Right, it may be that all that's needed here is some indication as to
how to describe a system which *does* have a DSP.  Perhaps require that
the devices be children of the DSP, that way if people want to access
the hardware directly they can load a dummy driver for the DSP that just
passes things through if they don't want to use the DSP?
