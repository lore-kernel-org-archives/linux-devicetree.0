OK. The issue here is that a coresight component could be an Arm IP or
a custom partner IP. So, the vendor could be either arm or the partner id.
However, this property is kind of a generic one for the Coresight family,
which is why we opted for "coresight". What is the guideline for such
cases ?

Or in other words I see the following possible options :

1) coresight,hwid	- coresight generic
2) arm,coresight-hwid	- arm vendor, however the device could be from any vendor.
3) hwid			- Generic
4) none of the above, something completely different.

What do you recommend from the above ?

We do have many-to-1 input (e.g, funnels) and 1-to-many outputs
(e.g replicators). However, we have (so far) used only one endpoint per
port.

Also we could potentially have multiple data streams flowing through
the ports, which gets filtered to different ports in 1-to-many components
(read programmable-replicator).

So the point is we have a shared path which carries different data
streams with mux/demux components. I am open for suggestions based on
the above facts.

Sorry, thats a mistake. I will fix it.
