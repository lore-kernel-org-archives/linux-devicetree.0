You mean one dtb right, because the kernel itself already runtime
adjusts itself.

But we will still need different configs in u-boot, and we need
to add code + config to u-boot to plug in the extra compatibles
to automatically select the right built-in overlays.

Ok, so for now this is not really an issue at all since the dts
does not yet decribe the lcd at all. So can you merge this one
renamed to a more generic name for 4.2?

That will work fine for now.

Then we can use the DT quirks interface to add different lcd
nodes for different variants once we get lcd support in the kernel,
and teach u-boot to add the extra board compatible to select
the right lcd node at that time.
