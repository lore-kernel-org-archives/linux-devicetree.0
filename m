Users of the MacBookPro13,1 and MacBookPro14,1 are reporting similar
timeouts when the Bluetooth controller is reset on ->setup.

These are the models without touchbar.  The models with touchbar
(MBP13,2, MBP13,3, MBP14,2, MBP14,3) as well as the 12" MacBooks
(MB8,1, MB9,1, MB10,1) do not suffer from this issue.

Christoph Gysin (+cc) reports that applying your patch on 4.16-rc4 gets
Bluetooth working on his MBP13,1:
https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux/issues/29#issuecomment-371434970

For some reason, not toggling the device_wake pin in bcm_gpio_set_power()
also fixed the issue for those users.  They did complain about stuttering
audio though.

Users of the touchbar models reported that stuttering audio only occurs
when the GNOME Bluetooth control panel is open. Closing it made the
stuttering audio go away.  But apparently on the non-touchbar models,
the stuttering persisted regardless.  Both the stuttering audio as well as
the timeouts on ->setup might be explained by a lack of hardware flow
control on those models.  The chipset (and thus the UART) is identical
on the touchbar versus non-touchbar models.  It would seem odd if Apple
did not wire CTS consistently on all models.

Thanks,

Lukas
