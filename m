As told in some other mail, such a video binding should be generic.
The number of ports depends on the hardware. Most SoCs have only one
port per LCD, but some other have many ports as the A83T (3 ports from
the LCD0).

Well, this example is extracted from the H3 where the DE and LCDs have
different clocks, I/O resources and functions (the DE builds the video
frames while the LCDs - TCONs - convert them to video flows).

The example is not complete because there are 2 LCDs in the H3:
		ports =3D <&lcd0_p>,		/* HDMI */
			<&lcd1_p>;		/* TV (CVBS) */
But, for SoCs with only one LCD, the description would be the same.
