Makes sense. I'll change it.

That's right. For the SoC I used as the example, there are four SPU 
hardware blocks. The driver round robins crypto requests to the hardware 
blocks to handle requests in parallel and increase throughput. I want 
one instance of the SPU driver that registers algos once with the crypto 
API and manages all the mailbox channels. Maybe I can achieve that with 
separate device tree entries for each SPU block, I'm not sure. I'll look 
into it.

Yes, each of these mailbox channels corresponds to a different SPU. PDC 
is a DMA ring manager for DMAs to the SPUs.
