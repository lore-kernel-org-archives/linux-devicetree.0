It seems quite close from what you want to achieve with cape manager.

You can have a look here:
https://github.com/linux4sam/linux-at91/tree/master/arch/arm/boot/dts

=46or example, we have up to 6 dts files for a single device:
sama5d36ek.dts, sama5d36ek_hdmi.dts, sama5d36ek_pda4.dts,
sama5d36ek_pda7.dts, sama5d36ek_revc.dts, sama5d36ek_revc_pda4.dts,
sama5d36ek_revc_pda7.dts

Our goal is that customers don't have to care about all this stuff. The=
y
load a single dtb file which can manage all these cases.
The change between revison c and revison d is the i2c device to which
the audio codec is connected. Difference between pda4 and pda7 (which
are display modules with a capacitive touchscreen) can be the irq used
the touch keyboard or the touchscreen.

Information we need are stored in an EEPROM which is accessible through
a one wire bus. As I said, we would like that the customers have no
dependency on other components if possible: bootloader, userspace,
firmware.

Do you think it's too early to use it? We are currently trying to
release a new kernel (based on 3.18) with some patches which have not b=
een
sent or accepted yet. Since I could merge easily your patches from Gran=
t
branch, I thought we could try to use it but spending time on a oneshoo=
t
solution is useless. That's why I would like to know what is the status
since it seems only the sysfs part is still in development.

Thanks so what is the next step? Posting a new patch series or the cape
manager? I mean if you plan to do it, I could have a look on how to
access the EEPROM through one wire.
