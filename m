Of course, that's how you turn off TDM mode.

It's possible there's bugs in older drivers, sometimes things get missed
in review.

I'd expect errors from previous uses of the driver to be discarded,
especially things that might've resulted from something like the reboot
process.

I'm not sure what you mean by a "single CODEC device".  Most devices are
so CODEC enables in I2C probe and then either leave everything on all
the time or manage the regulators with runtime power management of some
kind (either actual runtime PM or DAPM).  Managing things only in the
ASoC level probe increases complexity and in actual running systems
makes a marginal difference to real systems (you'd need to enable the
CODEC but not the card).

On both entry to _ON and both entries to _PREPARE (from _ON and from
_STANDBY)?  How does the device know we made these state changes?  It's
a total sleep of 1s on power on.

This doesn't seem very joined up with the rest of the power control of
the device - you're setting the high impedence state here, it's not
clear what undoes that and there's other power control in the suspend
and resume stuff.  I didn't notice anything in a nearby place that
cleared this state for example.
