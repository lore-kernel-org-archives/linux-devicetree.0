This:
 include/linux/mfd/madera/registers.h | 8832 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Get included in all subdrivers I suppose?

So you are broadcasting 8800+ lines into every subdriver across the
entire kernel.

Just the time spent in the preprocessor parsing this will affect compilation
time.

Please implement separation of concerns. Move the register definitions into
the drivers, and if they are too large, atleast make a local include file in
sound/soc for the codec parts so the GPIO subdriver does not have
to churn through all this to get its job done.

I know there are other MFD drivers doing this but it's not a good pattern.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
