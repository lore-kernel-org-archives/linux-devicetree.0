agreed about the DT node. But the drm_device must be associated with a
struct device. There is no reason to have the device representing the
whole display subsystem hang off of one IPU over the other, and I'd
rather not special case the IPU code with master/slave cases.

Except that one IPU has to create the drm_device and the other needs to
be drm_device-less.

Somehow it needs to know whether it should create the component master
and drm_device, or just register as a slave component. I'd strongly
prefer to have a look at the graph over giving explicit "master;" or
"slave;" properties to the IPU device nodes for this single
Linux-specific reason.

which is a sensible default for i.MX6.

Exactly. I'm not even sure it is necessary to assign a number.

I guess I missed it, though. Rereading the context, I am just
(re)stating that this is a problem beyond DRM and fbdev. Compiling a
kernel with two drivers binding to the same device, you effectively say
"whichever binds first, I don't care". To change this, we'd need
something similar to module blacklists for non-modular builds. I'd
rather strive to remove the need for duplicate drivers in the kernel.
