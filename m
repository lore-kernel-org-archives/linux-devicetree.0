Modules do work after init happened, that isn't what this feature is about.

Some initcalls assume that stuff is present when they called probe or 
register and do further action based on the rc code.

The list could be build just like the list of initcalls, but containing 
structs platform instead of function pointers.

The order is in now way part of this list, after all that's what this 
feature is about. The order is determined by metadatas in the DT, to get 
rid of a lot of otherwise necessary hardcoded stuff to fix the order in 
drivers.
