So this is something akin to the number of DMA channels a device might
use.

Either that's implicit knowledge of the device (if fixed), which doesn't
need to be in the DT, or a real property that should be described
explicitly in the device binding, that has nothing to do with UIO.

In general, a device which you might want to use with UIO may not
require such properties, so this is imposing a requirement on DTBs
purely for the sake of userspace software.

If the devices are so different, they should not be handled by the same
driver that has no knowledge of those differences. Platform VFIO has the
same problem, and requires device-specific reset drivers.

I don't follow. Here Rob stated:

  DT describes h/w. UIO is not a h/w block, so this does not belong in DT. A
  UIO vs. kernel driver is purely a kernel decision which shouldn't
  require a DT change.

  The properties should be part of match data for a compatible string that
  needs them set. Or if they can be defined in a way that is actually a
  property of the h/w, then it would be acceptible. You'd still need to
  define compatible strings that the properties apply to.

Above, you have come up with a default set of property names which you
go looking for, and you expect a class of property, even if you don't
expect specific names. That constitutes a binding, and a poorly-defined
one at that.

Per my reading, Rob's point in https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/23/539 was
that providing the *values* as module parameters was fine, not providing
the *property names*.

If you're looking for properties in the DT, you're assuming a binding of
some sort, regardless of whether you expect particular names.

To be clear, NAK to this as it stands.

Thanks,
Mark.
