Hi Sai,

I wanted to see if I could make some time to get your patches working. We are
hitting usecases that need something like this as well. Basically devices
hanging and then the ramdump does not tell us much, so in this case pstore
events can be really helpful. This usecase came up last year as well.

Anyway while I was going through your patches, I cleaned up some pstore code
as well and I have 3 more patches on top of yours for this clean up. I prefer
we submit the patches together and sync our work together so that there is
least conflict.

Here's my latest tree:

(note that I have only build tested the patches since I just wrote them and
its quite late in the night here ;-))

thanks,

- Joel
