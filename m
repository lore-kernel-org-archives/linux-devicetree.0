This patch series implements a read-only version of memremap() via
a new MEMREMAP_RO flag. If this is passed in the mapping call, we'll
try to map the memory region as read-only if it doesn't intersect
with an existing mapping. Otherwise, we'll try to fallback to other
flags to try to map the memory that way.

The main use case I have is to map the command-db memory region on
Qualcomm devices with a read-only mapping. It's already a const marked
pointer and the API returns const pointers as well, so this series makes
sure that even stray writes can't modify the memory. To get there we
introduce a devm version of memremap() for a reserved memory region, add
a memremap() flag, and implement support for that flag on arm64.

Changes from v1:
 * Picked up tags and rebased to v5.2-rc3
