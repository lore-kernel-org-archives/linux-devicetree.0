Will use armada-370.dtsi ones.

Will do.

ack. will also rename everything to -/_pins instead of pmx_/-

My bad. I reused what I found in kirkwood files w/o checking
trivial-devices.txt or vendor-prefixes.txt. Do you want me to add an
additional patch for kirkwood files too?

The 32-35 is for the MPP i.e. fan uses mpp32 to mpp35 (3 MPP for speed,
one for alarm). I don't know what the 100 part means. What I did is I
googled to see which fan supported kirkwood models have and noticed
that the DS212j uses the exact same fan, i.e. Y.S.Tech FD129225LL-N so
I opted for the same naming.

On that aspect, you may be able to explain why the speed-map for this
fan goes up to 5000 RPM. This fan is supposed to operate at 1900RPM.
Note that it does not matter in practice.

Cheers,
