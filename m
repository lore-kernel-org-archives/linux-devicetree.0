Just one more clarification.

First let me explain the IRQ routes a bit deeply. As I said earlier there are 
three ways in which IRQ can flow in AM65x SoC
1) Device directly connected to GIC
	- Device IRQ --> GIC
2) Device connected to INTR.
	- Device IRQ --> INTR --> GIC
3) Devices connected to INTA.
	- Device IRQ --> INTA --> INTR --> GIC

1 and 2 are straight forward and we use DT for IRQ representation. Coming to 3 
the trickier part is that Input to INTA and output from INTA and dynamically 
managed. To be more specific:
- By hardware design there are certain set of physical global events(interrupts) 
attached to an INTA. Out of which a certain range are assigned to the current 
linux host that can be queried from system-controller.
- Similarly out of all the INTA outputs(referenced as vints) a certain range can 
be used by the current linux host.


So for configuring an IRQ route in case 3, the following steps are needed:
- Device id and device resource index for which the interrupt is needed
- A free event id from the range assigned to the INTA in this host context
- A free vint from the range assigned to the INTA in this host context
- A free gic IRQ from the range assigned to the INTR in this host context.

With the above information, linux should send a message to system-controller 
using TISCI protocol. After policing the given information, system-controller 
does the following:
- Attaches the interrupt(INTA input) to the device resource index
- Muxes the interrupt(INTA input) to corresponding vint(INTA output)
- Muxes the vint(INTR input) to GIC irq(INTR output).

For grouping of interrupts, the same vint number is to be passed to 
system-controller for all the requests.

Keeping all the above in mind, I see the following as software IRQ Domain Hierarchy:

1) INTA multi MSI --> 2)INTA  -->3) MSI --> 4) INTR  -->5) GIC

INTA driver has to set a chained IRQ using virq allocated from its parent MSI. 
This is to differentiate the grouped interrupts within INTA.

Inorder to cover the above two MSI domains, a new bus driver has to be created 
as I couldn't find a fit with the existing bus drivers.

Does the above approach make sense? Please correct me if i am wrong.

Thanks and regards,
Lokesh
