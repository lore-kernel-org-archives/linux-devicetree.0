Hi Jassi,

Ping.
I posted some questions on another email to the ARM SMC mailbox
driver. But no response yet.
There are some issues with the latest ARM SMC mailbox driver I have seen so far.

* The message length is very limited. In our case, in order to send or
receive message from our mailbox hardware,
  we will need to extend the message length, in our case it is 32bytes.
  Here is what I am thinking about:
     * Opt 1: pass pointer from kernel to ATF to allow ATF to
read/write to the pointer.
     * Opt 2: define ARM-SMC message as
        struct arm_smc_msg {
                u32 len;
                void *msg;
                void *resp;
         };
         When sends to the message, use multiple SMC calls to copy the
message content to the SMCC parameters.
         Also use multiple SMC calls to get the response from SMCC parameters.
     * Opt3: even if our driver is using SMCC to send and receive
messages, but those SMCC calls will be specific to our hardware.
Instead of using a generic ARM-SMC mailbox driver, we have our vendor
specific mailbox driver in Linux kernel.

How do you think about the above options?

Thanks,
Wendy
