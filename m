But how do you know if this is the case?

Can you please name platform that has enough support for Alexander to
care about backwards and forwards compatibility but lacks a pinctrl
driver.

I agree that there is a chance that you _might_ get some parts of the
system working by relying on the boot loader configuration, but
misconfiguration issues applies to any other fundamental providers, such
as clocks, regulators, power domains and gpios as well.

As above, this is in no way limited to pinctrl drivers.

On the Qualcomm platform most drivers are tristate and on most platforms
there are size restrictions in the proprietary boot loader preventing us
from boot the kernel after switching all these frameworks from tristate
to bool (which feels like a more appropriate solution than your hack).

There are two cases here:
1) DT contains compatibles that isn't supported by the kernel. In this
case the associated device will remain in the probe deferral list and
user space won't know about the device.

2) DT contains compatibles known to the kernel but has new optional
properties that makes things functional or works around hardware bugs.

Cool, so what about graphics, audio, networking, usb and all the other
things that people actually expect when they _use_ a distro?

You forgot the humongous printout here that tells the users that we do
not want any bug reports related hardware not working as expected after
this point.

I do not agree with the partial benefits of this at the cost of not
supporting kernel modules.
