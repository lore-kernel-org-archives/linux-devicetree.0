The crypto_client is an example mailbox client for FlexRM mailbox.

The example shows that we have FlexRM ring manager providing
ring based programming interface to Crypto offload engine. The
Crypto offload engine driver is a mailbox client driver.

FlexRM mailbox requires 3 cells to specify each mailbox channel in
"mboxes" attribute of mailbox client DT node. The 1st cell is
mailbox channel number (or FlexRM ring number). Rest of the
cells are explained in bindings document.

Complete node would look something like below:

crypto_client {
     compatible = "brcm,iproc-spu2";
     mboxes = <&crypto_mbox 0 0x1 0xffff>,
                     <&crypto_mbox 1 0x1 0xffff>,
                     <&crypto_mbox 16 0x1 0xffff>,
                     <&crypto_mbox 17 0x1 0xffff>,
                     <&crypto_mbox 30 0x1 0xffff>,
                     <&crypto_mbox 31 0x1 0xffff>;
};

The Crypto driver was recently submitted by Rob Rice.
Refer https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg2395306.html

Similar to Crypto offload engine, we also have RAID offload
engine. The RAID offload engine driver is also implemented
as mailbox client driver.
