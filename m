In our current XGene platforms, there are 2 MCBs and each MCB has 2 MCs.
   MCB0 --> MC0 and MC1
   MCB1 --> MC2 and MC3
There are 2 CSR are being used (each uses 1 bit) together as indicators:
  CSR1 indicates if both MCBs are active.
  CSR2 indicates if both MCs of the same MCB are active.

This is the true table:
dual MCB      dual MC
0                   0            --> MC0 active
0                   1            --> MC0/MC1 active
1                   0            --> MC0/MC2 active
1                   1            --> MC0/MC1/MC2/MC3 active

At the time the driver initializes, I check the 2 CSRs to come up with
the mcb_active_mask and mc_active_mask.
The index bits are used to compare against the mcb_active_mask/mc_active_mask.

Yes, it's always a single bit. I'll use *-bit-index for these sub-nodes.

Thanks,
