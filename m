Again, they would be there serving as HW description. Like documentation.
3rd parties and the open-source community could then use them to write
drivers.

Also, it would avoid having multiple DTs (bootloader, Linux, etc.) or
using 'binary DT overlays'.

In one case the nodes/properties would be made public, most likely with
documentation (even if there's no driver for them), in the other case
undocumented 'binary DT overlays' are used.

I understand that.
However, it does not looks crazy to add some sort of 'staging', actually,
I found this:

$ find . -name 'stag*'
./Documentation/devicetree/bindings/staging
./drivers/staging
...
$ ls -1R ./Documentation/devicetree/bindings/staging
./Documentation/devicetree/bindings/staging:
iio
ion

./Documentation/devicetree/bindings/staging/iio:
adc

./Documentation/devicetree/bindings/staging/iio/adc:
lpc32xx-adc.txt
spear-adc.txt

./Documentation/devicetree/bindings/staging/ion:
hi6220-ion.txt

$ ls -1R ./drivers/staging | wc -l
2134

Isn't that a similar use to the one discussed in this thread?

Again, you are talking about drivers, but it is not the case at hand.

DT seems essentially free-form, like XML.
One could imagine that some tool could then be used to guarantee that
some parts of DT conform to a given XML schema, including backwards
compatibility, while at the same time ignoring 'staging' stuff.

The last step of my description, where the 'staging' bindings may not have
been used, was listed only for the sake of completeness since it is just a
possibility.
The hope is that they would be eventually used (most likely as is, but
there is also the possibility of having to rethink the bindings when
moving them from 'staging' to 'stable').

The immediate benefit is complete HW description, which, if generalised and
done properly would amount to HW documentation, isn't that good?

The commitment to stability can be enforced later, since changes would be
reviewed.

If the "user of the binding" is not Linux, under what circumstances
could "Linux" have the legitimacy of guaranteeing or enforcing any Linux-
specific commitment?

Interesting, do you know where in QEMU's code should I look for that?

Because the example I had in mind is something like (totally out of my
imagination):

   /sigma/ {
       audio_decoder_0: {
          version  = <2>;
          revision = <1>;
          program-memory = <0x20100000 0x1000>;
          data-memory    = <0x20101000 0x1000>;
          hwbug-list = <33, 57, 11>;
          arch = <DSP32>;
          mutex-id = <12>;
          irq-line = <9>;
          mbus-read-channels  = <2, 3>;
          mbus-write-channels = <12, 13>;
          has-AAC-support = <1>;
          has-DTS-support = <1>;
          has-SPDIF-output = <1>;
          ...
       };
       audio_decoder_1: {
          version  = <1>;
          revision = <0>;
          program-memory = <0x20200000 0x1000>;
          data-memory    = <0x20201000 0x1000>;
          hwbug-list = <33, 57>;
          arch = <DSP16>;
          mutex-id = <11>;
          irq-line = <8>;
          mbus-read-channels = <4>;
          mbus-write-channels = <14>;
          has-AAC-support = <1>;
          has-DTS-support = <0>;
          has-SPDIF-output = <0>;
          ...
       };
       ethernet: {
          mac-address = [ 00 11 22 33 44 55 ];
          hwbug-list = <23>;
       };
       video_decoder: {
          version = <4>;
          revision = <0>;
          memory = <0x20300000 0x10000>;
          arch = <MIPS4K>;
          mutex-id = <12>;
          irq-line = <7>;
          has-H264-support = <1>;
          ...
       };
   ...
   };

We could even imagine a section like:

   boot: {
      verify-images = <1>;
      boot-order = <NAND, SD, SATA>;
      enable-uart = <0>;
      debug-level = <1>;
   };

I gave one above, but I still don't understand why would it matter.
I mean, it should be easy:
- is the node/property used by a Linux driver?
  - YES => you must submit both DT+driver
  - NO  => we don't care

I see, thanks.

Like I said, this started like an hypothetical question as a way to centralise
all HW description in a single place.
Currently it is spread over multiple places and it is very error prone, not
to mention that not everybody gets all the information at once.
Also, DT is meant to be shared by at least Bootloader and Linux, so it would
be better if it was unique.

Anyway, I tried to make a more concrete example further above.
Hopefully it serves to illustrate more the idea.

Yes, but "must be evolved so as to allow software to handle them in a stable
fashion, supporting old and new DTBs." makes sense for Linux drivers, or
from Linux's perspective.

Project independence rules should allow for projects to cooperate without
interfering with each other.

IMHO, they apply only when there's a Linux driver, or any other public
user of such bindings. But if there's no user, it seems like an unnecessary
constraint.
