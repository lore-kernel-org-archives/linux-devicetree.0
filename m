Changes since v1:
- Collected reviews and acks
- Addressed Stephen's review comments (hopefully I got them all).
- Completely removed critical interrupt infrastructure from this series.
  Will post that separately.
- Fixed a bug in sign-extension of temperature.
- Fixed DT bindings to use the name of the interrupt e.g. "uplow" and use
  platform_get_irq_byname().

Add interrupt support to TSENS. The first 6 patches are general fixes and
cleanups to the driver before interrupt support is introduced.

This series has been developed against qcs404 and sdm845 and then tested on
msm8916 and msm8974 (Thanks Brian). Testing on msm8998 would be appreciated since I don't
have hardware handy.
