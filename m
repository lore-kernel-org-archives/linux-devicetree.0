I think for the clocks we need something describing which bits
in the clock register the "pll" and "pll-switched" belong to.

Otherwise we'll end up having to map all that data in the clock
driver for various SoC variants.

Here I think we need a better solution for finding the
clocks by name. Doing clock-input = <&osc 0>, <&pll 1> means
that we have redefine the uart for similar SoC many times.

How about using source + option in the name instead:

	   clock-source-name = "osc.osc", "pll.pll-switched";

This same solution would also work for the pinctrl names:

	   pinctrl-source-name = "uart1_rx.uart1_rx", "dss_data7.uart1_tx";

The reason I'm worried here is that just for omap2/3/4 we already
have 3 options for uart1 clock and 19 options for uart1_rx pin!

Using the signal names for both clocks and pinctrl would
allow defining the uart entry for for each reg address instead
of for each clock and pinctrl option.
