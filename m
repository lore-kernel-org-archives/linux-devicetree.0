I'm not sure I follow. If it's not acceptable to increase the size, 
why's there overlay support in the first place?

There're distros/downstreams that support overlays today, like armbian, 
beaglebone and rpi. All carrying their own patches to enable symbols [1] 
[2] [3] and I'm sure others will follow. Why can't there be some sort of 
switch for those to build their dtbs with symbols?

Andre
