Yeah, I know that, and it's exactly why we have these nodes
pre-populated it. But my point was exactly that: Why not leverage the
fact that we have that possibility to add the missing clock for the
frontend, and just use that.

Heh :)

I'm not really asking for a crystal ball. I even expect that list to
grow, as some board will probably need the second display engine on
SoCs that have one, and that's ok. But my concern is more that we will
end up with multiple similar options, including ones that we know are
not in use, but can't really remove either.

But yeah, ok.
