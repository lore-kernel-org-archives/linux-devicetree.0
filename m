Recent Qualcomm PMIC's devices are accessed over SPMI bus.
Every PMIC has several "sub-function" devices inside.

First three patches are adding device nodes to PM8841, PM8941 and PMA8084 PMIC's.
Next two are introducing PM8916 PMIC chip with its device nodes. The sixth one
add restart device node for MSM8916 chip. And the last one add initial GPIO
definitions for APQ8016 SBC board.

checkpatch will complain about "appears un-documented" for several drivers,
but I am expecting they to mergeed soon, hopefully during this merge window.

Changes since v0 [2]:

* Add proper IRQ_TYPE_* specifiers in the interrupt bidings.

Patches are created top of Kumar's kernel tree and tags/qcom-dt-for-4.1 [1].
