I don't see what that would change. Doing a cross-device binding in DT
is hard, as we see by lots of people (e.g. the above "samsung,mbox-names"
crap) getting it wrong. If we do it properly once, everyone can use the
same binding, and common code to parse the connection between the
mailbox driver and the user.

I don't see why we should do it any different from the other bindings.
Let's just stick with mboxes/mbox-names or mailboxes/mailbox-names
if you prefer.

That is a major benefit though.
Also even if most drivers won't work across multiple platforms, there
is still a reasonable chance that /some/ drivers will.
