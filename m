Hi,

Version 3 has following changes compared to v2 [1]:
- rebased on top of 4.9-rc1
- dropped some of the controversial DT properties like ti,ssc-clocks etc.
- driver now registers all the SCI clocks during probe time, for this,
  there is an array built-in to the driver with knowledge of valid clocks
  for the device
- xlate only picks up the clocks registered during probe

This series depends on the base SCI protocol support series [2]
and the TI-SCI generic PM domain support series for the device
ID include file [3].

Quick boot test seems to be fine.
