Even if I set the budget to something large, unless I limit the rx side in some 
way it could go on multiple rounds around the circular buffer until it have used 
all the budget. So in some way or another, grcan_receive must be hindered from 
using all the budget.

Sorry, but I am not sure what aspect of the marvell driver poll handling you 
want me to mimic. Without having analyzed exactly how the queueing works yet, it 
seems to make sure that every function that is called from the poll function 
gets ample opportunity to do work by not letting one function hogging all the 
budget. If you want me to mimic it in the aspect of doing work in series of 16 
or something like that, sure, no problem. If it is something else you want to 
point to, please let me know what.


The simplest way to make sure that both tx and rx gets to run is to take 
inspiration from the ethoc driver [1] and just let the tx side get just as much 
budget as the rx side and be done with it. With the echo frames for can, the 
budget should be halved for each I guess to make sure no more frames are 
delivered than the budget, but apart from that I don't see the problem with such 
a simple approach.

static int ethoc_poll(struct napi_struct *napi, int budget)
{
	struct ethoc *priv = container_of(napi, struct ethoc, napi);
	int rx_work_done = 0;
	int tx_work_done = 0;

	rx_work_done = ethoc_rx(priv->netdev, budget);
	tx_work_done = ethoc_tx(priv->netdev, budget);

	if (rx_work_done < budget && tx_work_done < budget) {
		napi_complete(napi);
		ethoc_enable_irq(priv, INT_MASK_TX | INT_MASK_RX);
	}

	return rx_work_done;
}
