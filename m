Looking at the original code I remember not mandating enpoints to be
valid for debugging purposes.  That certainly helps when building up a
device tree file but also has the side effect of silently overlooking
specification problems.  Fortunately the revamping you did on that
part of the code makes it very easy to change that, something I think
we should take advantage of (it can only lead to positive scenarios
where defective specifications get pointed out).

That being said and because the original behaviour is just as
permissive, you can leave as is.

Thanks,
Mathieu
