Don't design bindings around what ASoC wants and don't explain it in 
terms of how ALSA works. Design bindings in a way that reflects the h/w.

This explanation seems completely wrong to me. It seems like you are 
abusing OF graph to just create 2 instances of a simple-card which would 
be working around some ASoC limitation.

I'd expect the top level node to be the card node that knows how to find 
all the components. The graph should reflect the data flow. For example, 
the data goes to audio DSP to I2S host to codec to amp.
