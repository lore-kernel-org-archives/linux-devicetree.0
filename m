Yes because the property replaces the quirk, I can split the changes between
the codec and machine driver into 2 patches but then the intermediate state
will be that the jack-detection no longer works.

It is not _that_ fragile, but I agree that it would be good to add
a comment about not moving the property-parsing to the codec driver.

I will rebase and submit a new version with a comment added.
Do you want me to split this patch into separate codec and machine
driver patches while at it?

The problem here is that the data is not coming from the firmware,
which is a reality we have to deal with leading to some sort of
compromise.

Ack.

Something like DT overlays for ACPI? With the overlays being triggered
by a DMI match? Interesting concept, but given how much discussion there
still is surrounding DT overlays I don't see this happening anytime soon.
