Ok, I understand that if the user just updates to new kernel(w/o
updating bootloader) then this patch will end up setting "misc"
partition at wrong offset. At this point, I don't see how to provide a
way to upgrade boot loader at the same time support old and new layouts
simultaneously.
Could you please suggest an alternative approach that would enable users
to update U-Boot partition?
If not, then I guess, will have to drop this patch. Note that, this
means there won't be a straight forward way of updating SPI U-Boot
partition from kernel for K2 devices.
