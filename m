True, corresponds with the left-over #include in linux/irqchip/orion.h.

I see what I can do.

The reason for a new compatible string is, that we will also need an
secondary irq controller for bridge irqs. That could be called
marvell,orion-spic. Dove is again a little bit different than the
others and this will require timer and especially rtc not to share
bridge irqs here. RTC irq is located in PMU regs on Dove instead of
bridge regs.

But I don't have a strong opinion here and we can also reuse
marvell,orion-intc for the irqchip driver.

I didn't follow irqchip discussion lately, but will catch up.

Same as above.

Thanks for the review,
