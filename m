There is no need. You can simply revert the patches, it's OK that the
drivers bounce in and out of the kernel.

The clock driver will just probe instead of the reset driver (due to being
earlier in the link order... OK fragile but it works), so there
will not even be a runtime conflict.

There is no need for that, the bindings do not change with this approach.

OK then that is what we're gonna do.

I'm onto it!
