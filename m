Good point.

I thought about PM runtime operations a little while back but wondered if it is
really a good thing to have them around.  When this code is called the system
has crashed and as such making PM runtimes call isn't a good idea.

One thing we could do is _not_ call pm_runtime_put() at the end of the probe()
operation.  That way we wouldn't have to mess around with PM runtime operations
on an unstable system.  This, of course, is costly in terms of power consumption
but the system is under test/debug anyway.

Thoughts?
