Hi Kevin,

It was purely informative.

No problem. BTW do you also consider CONFIG_ items not arch specific
(like CONFIG_NET_VENDOR_SMSC) ?

That's what I thought too, mainline U-Boot is using omapl138_lcdk but
yes da850 is less confusing given the code already present (downside is
when you search for da850 on the net there's nothing).
