I will rework the commit message

Other drivers like prima2 have the same problem.
They have solve it by checking if the current time is still below next event
time after wirting it, so the function will be like that:

unsigned long now, next;

next = readl_relaxed(timer_of_base(to) + TIM_CNT) + evt;
writel_relaxed(next, timer_of_base(to) + TIM_CCR1);
writel_relaxed(TIM_DIER_CC1IE, timer_of_base(to) + TIM_DIER);
now = readl_relaxed(timer_of_base(to) + TIM_CNT);

return next - now > delta ? -ETIME : 0;

The  CPU is a CortexM4 @ 200MHZ and the clocks driving the timers are at 90MHZ
with a min delta at 1 you could have an interrupt each 0.01 ms which
is really to much.
By increase it to 0x60 it give time to CPU to handle the interrupt.

Also want to remove 16 bits counters because the maximum period is around 750 ms
which is a short period for a clocksource.
With 32 bits this period is close 47 secondes.

I will forward you point of to the hardware designer but I will have to deal the
hardware I have anyway.
