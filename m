The manual which Fabio pointed me at (iMX 6Solo/6DualLite - IMX6SDLRM.pdf)
doesn't correspond - figure 28-1 is something entirely different.

Okay, but from what I'm working from (which works) the order is:

- Set IOMUXC GPR1 bit 21.
- Set ipg/ahb ethernet clock to 50MHz
- IOMUX settings applied, including setting the reference clock SION bit
- Reset lowered, wait 2ms, reset raised
- imx6_init_fec(fec_data_rgmii) called

After that is the time that the phy is configured to supply the 125MHz
reference clock into the IMX6.

That order seems to be happening with my 3.12-rc1 kernel, although a
little more spread out.

Thanks.
