Alright, thanks for the detailed explanation. I dropped the "ti,am33xx-
tilcdc" from the list and here is the updated patch I am queuing for

    ARM: dts: da850: add a node for the LCD controller
    
    Add pins used by the LCD controller and a disabled LCDC node to be
    reused in device trees including da850.dtsi.

    [Bartosz:
      - added the commit description
      - changed the dt node name to a generic one
      - added a da850-specific compatible string
      - removed the tilcdc,panel node
      - moved the pins definitions to da850.dtsi as suggested by
        Sekhar Nori (was in: da850-lcdk.dts)]
