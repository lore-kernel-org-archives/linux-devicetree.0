It will be a bit of a stretch, but it's possible. Most syscalls are
done in linux-next,
I have a few more pending, and only clock_adjtime is really missing now (I had
some earlier patches that I could revive).

My plan was to get that all into 4.20, and then have a conversation about the
actual syscall table changes in 4.21. If we need it for both csky and rv32,
we might just change the generic syscall table that way in 4.21 without
changing all the other ones along with them. I don't want to drag things out
over too many merge windows though, and my plan was to do all architectures
together to simplify the version checks in the libc code to only have to check
for a single version.
