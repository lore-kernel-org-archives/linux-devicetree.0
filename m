I find it quite strange that you must explicitly enable the parent
node, but not the uart node.

How do you debug the DM itself? It seems like you still would need
something earlier for debug like earlycon in the kernel. u-boot DM is
probably simple enough you can get away with using it early, but you
often can't as the complexity increases. Ultimately you need something
simple that just hits all the registers needed to get characters out.
What happens when you add pinmux, clocks, PMIC, power domains, etc. to
the DM and they all become dependencies for the UART?

Can't the need for that property change over time? Either as more
drivers are converted to DM you need to add this or you add some
feature that depends on a driver (e.g. get a board rev or boot mode
from GPIO). You would have backwards compatibility issues with this.
I'm somewhat less worried about that for u-boot as we should be
bundling the dtb and bootloader rather than kernel and dtb. For the
UART, you can just get which UART to initialize early from
stdout-path. But for other cases, couldn't you just have the platform
provide the list of needed drivers. Then when u-boot needs change, you
just change u-boot.

Well, for starters bindings need to be documented, so you need to send
this as a binding doc with this detail.
