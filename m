As far as I can tell, this looks correct. A few key things though:

- Please write decent commit logs. Indicate *why* you think these
  properties can be removed (hint: not finding corresponding in the
  drivers is not enough a reason, the binding itself matters).

- Spend two minutes looking at the ML archives, and try to find why we
  ended-up with these orphan properties (something like this:
  https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/devicetree-discuss/2012-November/023482.html
  contains useful historical information).

- Cc the relevant platform maintainers. You're changing things that they
  care about, basic courtesy is to keep them in the loop.

All of this will help maintainers to quickly decide on the fate of these
patches.

Thanks,

	M.

Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.
