How do you know which i2s inputs to enable?

Does it make sense for the audio inputs to be mixed like that?

You will need to enable one i2s for front L+R, and increasingly others
for the additional channels.

I think we need to understand exactly how the 998x map I2S inputs to the
HDMI channels to avoid making a mistake with the binding; remember, the
binding isn't something that can be easily "bug fixed" at a later date
as anything we come up with now has to be supported long term by the
kernel.
