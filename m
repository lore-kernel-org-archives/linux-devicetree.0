In this fifth revision the patchset moves away from the idea
including ARMv7-M platforms into ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM, but
instead adds a new top-level config symbol ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M
Patch 7 adds this new config symbol while patch 8 alters the
existing ARMv7-M platform ARCH_EFM32 to use ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M.
I chose to move the config symbol of the ARMv7-M specific
architectures (ARCH_EFM32 at that point) below the multiarch
includes. I think it is a good idea to keep them together, but
I'm not sure if this is an appropriate place. The architecture
which Vybrid is depending on, ARCH_MXC, is not also selectable
when ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M is selected.

Since v3, this patchset does not contain the interrupt router
driver anymore (MSCM IR). The driver has been merged inbetween:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/3/8/6

This patchset extends the NVIC driver to support irq domain
hierarchy and the MSCM IR driver to support NVIC as a parent
irq controller.

The patchset has proven to be working on the Cortex-M4 of the
Vybrid SoC using a Colibri VF61 module.

Note: This patchset has dependencies on "ARM: ARMv7-M: Enlarge
vector table up to 256 entries" (Maxime Coquelin) and the
"irqchip: vf610-mscm: add MSCM interrupt router driver" patch-
set (lined up for next in Jason Cooper's irqchip git tree).

Changes since v4:
- Added ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M as top-level config symbol for ARMv7-M
  architectures
- Cleaned up unnecessary selects within SOC_VF610
- Added linux,stdout-path to device tree

Changes since v3:
- Added dependency IRQ_DOMAIN_HIERARCHY for ARM_NVIC
- Fix MSCM IR disable function check
- Remove "ARM: imx: depend MXC debug board on 3DS machines",
  the patch has been merged

Changes since v2:
- Update MSCM patches to merged version of MSCM interrupt router
- Use the GPLv2/X11 dual license in the new device tree files
- Drop SD controller in device tree (initramfs works now and is
  probably more appropriate for most cases)
- Disable GPIO nodes since the A5 is using them
- Drop CONFIG_ prefixes in Kconfig changes for MXC_DEBUG_BOARD
- Drop vector table resizing in favor of Maxime Coquelin's patch
  (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/2/20/399)
- Remove !MMU dependency for ARCH_EFM32 since its part of
  ARCH_MULTI_V7M
- Rebased on v4.0-rc1

Changes since v1:
- Remove MSCM driver
- Support irq domain hierarchy with NVIC irq controller
- Extend MSCM interrupt router with NVIC as parent in the irq
  domain hierarchy 
- Rebased on v3.19-rc1 with MSCM driver
- NVIC: Register only the amount of IRQ's which vectors are
  available for

Changes since RFC:
- Unified addruart calls for MMU/!MMU
- Add MSCM support along with routable IRQ support in NVIC
- Rebased on Shawns for-next tree which made some changes
  obsolete (mainly the Vybrid SoC device tree files in for-next
  are already prepared for Cortex-M4 support)
- Removed SRC_GPR3 hack, this is now part of a mini boot-loader:
