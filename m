I can follow your rationale of only describing the extended register set,
if available.

However:
  1) The DT bindings should state clearly that the AUDMAPP register
     block should point to the extended register set, if available,
  2) Can the driver distinguish between an old DTB describing the basic
     register set, and a new DTB describing the extended register set?
     I.e. will the driver avoid using busif4-7 when using an old DTB
     describing the basic register set, to maintain backwards compatibility?

Thanks!

P.S. The binding doc seems to need some love.
     I came up with the following a while ago, but got interrupted.
     Feel free to steal ;-)
