Actually, how I've been guiding folks is 2 levels of nodes.

eim {
  #address-cells = <3>;
  cs@0,0 {
    compatible = "bar,some-device";
    foo,eim-timing-prop = <0>;
  };

This is how most bindings have been done. There's not really any point
to 3 levels other than keeping CS properties separate, but they don't
need to be if they are properly prefixed. The timing for a device is a
property of the device even though we express them in terms of the
controller.

Yes.

Yes.
