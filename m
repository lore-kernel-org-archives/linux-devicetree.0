Hi Stephen,

I just happened across a to-do list note telling me to respond to this
email. Better late than never.

The meeting you're referring to did not focus on clock provider bindings
as much as it focused on a pair of standard clock attributes that could
be referenced by clock consumers. They are "assigned-clock-parent" and
"assigned-clock-rate". The usage scribbled on the white board[1] was
something like:

mux: mux {
	clocks = <&clock-foo>, <&clock-bar>;
};

uart: uart {
	clocks = <&mux>;
	assigned-clock-parent = <1>;
};

In the example above assigned-clock-parent uses the index of the mux,
but I prefer the following:

uart: uart {
	clocks = <&mux>;
	assigned-clock-parent = <&clock-bar>;
};

This is a way to establish initial configuration from the consumer's
perspective. Similarly something can be done for the clock rate with
assigned-clock-rate.

With all of that said this is consumer-level stuff. We'll definitely
talk about the clock provider DT bindings at the ARM Summit, which is
what you discuss above.

Regards,
Mike
