Based on this patch series, the only difference seems to be w.r.t ARM
components, not peripherals outside ARM subystem. Vybrid VF610 is a
similar case, though not identical (it can have both instead of
either), deals w/o extra symbols,

Your wish fulfilled, Vybrid VF610 has both A5 & M4F and mainline Linux
boots on both (simultaneously as well), and the second Linux support,
i.e. on M4 went thr' your keyboard, see above commit :)

There are quite a few others as well, TI's AM335x (A8 + M3), AM437x
(A9 + M3), AM57x (A15 + M4), but of these Cortex M's, the one in AM57x
only can be Linux'able. On others they are meant for PM with limited
resources.

Me being an electrical engineer & worked to some extent in motor
control on RTOS/no OS (the value of my opinion is questionable
though), the thought of handling the same in Linux (even RT) sends
shivers down my spine. Here, case being considered is the type of
motor (like permanent magnet ones) where each phase of the motor has
to be properly excited during every PWM period (say every 100us,
depending on the feedback, algorithm, other synchronization) w/o which
the motor that has been told to run might try to fly. This is
different from stepper motor where if control misbehaves/stops nothing
harmful normally happens.

But my opinion is a kind of knee-jerk reaction and based on prevalent
atitude in that field, hmm.., probably i should attempt it first.
