ACPI is a mix of binary tables (can be dereferenced directly as C
structs) and the "ACPI Namespace" which looks remarkably like a device
tree, except the nodes contains bytecode methods instead of static
properties. Many of the methods are defined by the ACPI standard to be
called for various events; like initialization and power management
activities. A lot of core devices on the platform are described both in
the static tables and the ACPI namespace.

(The ACPI namepaces is the structure decoded by interpreting the bytecode
in the DSDT and SSDT tables.)

As I see it, ACPI prefers to defer the difficult bits to the platform
by using a bytecode to perform arbitrary operations. DT on the other
hand defers to the kernel.

This too should look transparent to device drivers. DT and ACPI have
different mechanism for doing cross tree references, but the concept is
the same. A driver calling something like "platform_get_my_gpio_resource()"
should do the right thing with either an ACPI or DT backend. None of
that should appear as custom device driver or architecture code. It
should be generic code supporting the driver core.

Regardless of the ACPI on ARM question, we need to do this anyway. There
are Intel platforms that need it.
