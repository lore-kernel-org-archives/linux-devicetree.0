Should we still try to have a common behaviour where possible?
Such that even if there are two bindings, they don't diverge in
"unnecessary" ways?

But given that we already are past -rc5, I guess the suggested
change is too late for v3.14 anyway.  So we have to live with the
fact of a mainline release of different behaviour.

And the backwards compatibility support in the MPC512x CCF
implementation allows to cope with a potential future "ipg"
unification while still working with former "per" using device
trees.  There's no blocker.  So nevermind.
