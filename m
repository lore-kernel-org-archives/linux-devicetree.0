There is no first or second output in the kirkwood controller; there
are I2S and S/PDIF outputs. Their hardware controls are done by bits in
the different registers. Then, the driver may define its DAIs in any
order and assign any DAI ID to these DAIs. So, for a given DAI, there
is no relation between its type (I2s or S/PDIF), index in the dai
driver (=3D asoc component index) and ID.

In the simple-card DT, the CPU DAI (as the CODEC DAI) is referenced by
a phandle (the audio-controller) and a number which should identify the
DAI. This number is translated to a DAI name thanks to the function
snd_soc_get_dai_name(). This function scans the components and returns
the name of the DAI (component) supported by the audio controller with
the searched number equal to the component index (there is no 'xlate'
function).

So, with the simple-card, the CPU or CODEC DAI binding (phandle +
number) identifies what the software has put in its table, but not a
hardware entity.

A card builder is a device which
- scans the graph of ports,
- fills the struct snd_soc_card according to the links between the
  ports and their properties,
- and, eventually, calls snd_soc_register_card().

The simple card builder, 'dt-card' (maybe a better name would have been
'graph-card'), acts just like the simple-card except that it does not
appear in the DT. Its creation is done by an audio controller.

=46or complex cards, a card builder would be the same as an actual card
driver, but with the capability to know about the board thanks to the
graph of ports. Its creation could be done by a compatible device in
the DT (as actually) or by the unique or a 'master' audio controller.

A card builder is subject to a PROBE_DEFER after calling
snd_soc_register_card(), so, when it is created by an audio controller,
this last one should have created its own resources.

An audio controller does the following:
- initialize the hardware and software,
- create the DAIs from:
	- the graph of ports or
	- default values
- register these DAIs and
- if the DAIs where created by a graph of port,
	create the card builder.

Well, forget about this. I never clearly understood why some widgets
and routes had to be defined at card level.

Using a graph of port to describe the audio subsystem has been pushed
forwards by many people for a long time, as shown by the creation of
the document Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

Anyway, I am also glad to have this discussion.
