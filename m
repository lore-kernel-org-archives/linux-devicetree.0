Overall the inner workings are hidden as there is an ops struct
instead of public functions.

I agree that the "fetch the node" boilerplate code could be put behind
a helper, but at the same time this code helps remind the developer
that there needs to be a canvas node in the dts, and that it has to be
linked in your own device node.

I would like to keep it that way if that is okay with you.
