Hi everyone,

This series adds new "sunxi-ng" style drivers for the CCUs found in the
Allwinner A80 SoC. The A80 contains 1 main clock control unit, and some
subsystem specific clock control units at separate addresses. These
include the USB, display engine, and MMC.

  - The MMC clocks can be supported by the old clock drivers,
    hence here we do not add a new driver for it.

  - The old USB clock driver is intertwined with other SoCs,
    requires old style bindings with clock-output-names and
    CLK_OF_DECLARE for its parents. It is easier to switch
    to a new binding and driver.

  - The display engine (DE) CCU was not supported in the past.

The A80 CCU also has some quirks about its design. It has

  - Separate registers for PLL lock status

  - P1, P2 dividers, which are power-of-2 and only 1 bit wide

The first 3 patches fix and extend the behavior of sunxi-ng's
mux clock type, based on the behavior of the clk subsystem's
basic mux clock.

The fourth patch adds support for checking PLL lock status
bits in separate registers, as opposed to within the PLL's
config register.

Patches 5 through 7 add drivers for the CCU blocks.

Patches 8 through 10 do some cleanup of the sunxi/allwinner dts
files prior to switching sun9i dts to the new sunxi-ng clock
bindings. These are independent of the clk stuff, but touch the
same lines for sun9i. Including them should make it easier to
apply and test patches.

Patch 11 has sun9i switch over to the new clock bindings.

Please take a look and let me know what you think.

I also have a series adding support for the first display pipeline
of the A80 with RGB LCD panel output which I will send out later
on.


Regards
ChenYu
