Interesting. I have been playing with the idea of putting a .register()
callback into struct clk_init_data. Then it would be called by a new
clk_register_desc() top-level registration function.

You've done that here, but you've put the registration function in your
machine-specific struct. Nothing wrong with that.

Do you actually need a machine-specific registration function? Many clk
drivers only use their machine-specific registration functions to
allocate a stuct clk_hw and populate the contents of struct
clk_init_data, which can be done by the framework and reduce duplicate
code in drivers.

(they do this because the basic clk types like clk-divider, clk-gate,
etc do it, and everyone loves to copy/paste that code)

bcm2835 seems to register two clks in the PLL registration function (one
of which is a fixed factor divider), but you could just add those
post-PLL dividers to your array of clk data?

I guess that you can order them in your array? Just start with the root
clocks at the beginning of the array (regardless of "clk type") and walk
through the array registering them.
