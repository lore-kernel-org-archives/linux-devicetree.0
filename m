Maybe I missed something but as the crypto is fully integrated in the SoC,
if for a given SoC it works on a board it would work on all the boards using
the same SoC.

The board specific part seems about setting memory address on the mbus.

By the way could you add a comment in front of the new line ? so next time
someone will copy and past one of the dts file, he will understand the
signification of these two lines.

But is it really depending of the board itself?
I see that the first lines are the same on all the dts, I just remember that
there was a reason why we could not put it in the dtsi. My point here, is as
the configuration is the same on all the boards, adding the crypto on all the
board should work without any issue.


Thanks,

Gregory
