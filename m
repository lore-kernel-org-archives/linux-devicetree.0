After having a dig around, the comment at the top of the file says
this implementation was originally cloned from arch/arm/mach-vexpress/platsmp.c.

After some googling I can see that you submitted this patch
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2010-December/033678.html
which consolidated this call back in December 2010 from the platform specific
secondary startup code into the common SMP code.

At this time, the STi implementation was being maintained 'out of tree', so
although I can't say for certain, I strongly suspect that this could be why
the call is there, and that when this implementation was submitted in 2013
it was missed during the review process.

100% agree. This is a good example of why upstreaming code is a good idea.

None that I'm aware of, however I'm not the original author or submitter of
the code. I just booted several times with this call removed and everything
appears to work OK.

As I suspect it is due to the implementation being 'out of tree' at the time
of your patch, I will submit another patch which removes this call.

regards,

Peter.
