I have done it and tested. It works as expected. Thanks.
I have created region at phys addr 0x10000000 with selected size.
I had to move carveout in resource table to be first in this area.
Also removed that copying from kick function.



I have one small problem which is that physical address is 0x10000000
which means that firmware entry point is the same.
In rproc_load_segments is da composed from phdr->p_paddr which is 0x10000000.
And code is designed that this load addr is offset.

Here is the code:
	/* go through the available ELF segments */
	for (i = 0; i < ehdr->e_phnum; i++, phdr++) {
		u32 da = phdr->p_paddr; // OFFSET 0x10000000
		u32 memsz = phdr->p_memsz;

But for my case is physical address correct and it is not offset 0x10000000.
I have created temporary fix which substract virtual address to get correct da.

u32 da = phdr->p_paddr - phdr->p_vaddr;

What should be correct solution?

ok. It also works.

Thanks,
