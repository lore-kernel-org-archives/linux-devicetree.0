Well, in fact the of_find_matching_node() function already indent the 
ref. count...

... That is why I added this comment ^^

But maybe for sake of clarity, I may have used what you propose anyway. 
What it your opinion?

That looks nice. I will try to implement this. I will try to figure out 
when of_irq_init() is called compared to the other init_IRQ() function.

That is a annoying point: I do not want to add all this "default" 
priority stuff in the DT. It is kind of useless until we use the 
threaded interrupts everywhere and may bloat the DT...

I will try to find a way to pass the default priority table to the DT 
called function.

Thanks for your review,
