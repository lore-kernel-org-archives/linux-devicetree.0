We've been inconsistent in the past, hence why it would be great to
have bus instead.

Look into the other devices, for other SoCs. Pointing out that we've
been bad in the past doesn't mean that we can't improve.

How do you deal with SoCs with multiple display engines then?

What do you mean with LCD? Panels? Why would panels have a phandle to
the display engine?

I have no idea what you're talking about, sorry.

Pointing out random example in the tree doesn't make a compelling

Why are you about framebuffer now, this is nowhere in that
discussion. Any way, the framebuffer is also what is put in a plane,
so there's a name collision here, and you'll probably want to change
it.

Judging by the previous discussion, this should really be called
encoder if it encodes the frames on a bus format, or CRTC if it
composes the planes.

You can check all the constraints you exposed above in atomic_check
instead of hardcoding it.

If it's different drivers, why are they in the same module?

I'm sorry, but that doesn't make any sense. The crtc device should
take care of the CRTC functions. Your DRM CRTC and encoders can
definitely be shared across different devices, you can have a look at
how we're doing it for sun4i.

We basically have 3 drivers to create most of the display pipeline:
  - One for the DRM device
  - One for the display engine
  - One for the TCON

Once they have all loaded and registered in the component framework,
their bind callback is called, and it's when the DRM entities are
created using exported functions to manipulate what needs to be setup.

It's definitely doable, it just takes some effort.

You can use those planes to do composition too, with each application
having one or more plane. Android uses that.

There's no argument to have a cursor plane, really. Even regular
graphic stack like X can use a regular overlay to have its cursor on
it. It doesn't *remove* anything, it just allows to use the plane for
what it was supposed to be used for.
