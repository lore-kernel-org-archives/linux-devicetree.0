SLIMbus (Serial Low Power Interchip Media Bus) is a specification
developed by MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) alliance.
SLIMbus is a 2-wire implementation, which is used to communicate with
peripheral components like audio-codec.
SLIMbus uses Time-Division-Multiplexing to accommodate multiple data
channels, and control channel. Control channel has messages to do
device-enumeration, messages to send/receive control-data to/from
slimbus devices, messages for port/channel management, and messages to
do bandwidth allocation.
The framework supports multiple instances of the bus (1 controller per
bus), and multiple slave devices per controller.

This patch does device enumeration, logical address assignment,
informing device when the device reports present/absent etc.
Reporting present may need the driver to do the needful (e.g. turning
on voltage regulators powering the device). Additionally device is
probed when it reports present if that device doesn't need any such
steps mentioned above.

+SLIM(Serial Low Power Interchip Media Bus) bus
+
+SLIMbus is a 2-wire bus, and is used to communicate with peripheral
+components like audio-codec.
+
+Controller is a normal device using binding for whatever bus it is
+on (e.g. platform bus).
+Required property for SLIMbus controller node:
+- compatible	- name of SLIMbus controller following generic names
+		recommended practice.
+- #address-cells - should be 2
+- #size-cells	- should be 0
+
+No other properties are required in the SLIMbus controller bus node.
+
+Child nodes:
+Every SLIMbus controller node can contain zero or more child nodes
+representing slave devices on the bus. Every SLIMbus slave device is
+uniquely determined by the enumeration address containing 4 fields:
+Manufacturer ID, Product code, Device index, and Instance value for
+the device.
+If child node is not present and it is instantiated after device
+discovery (slave device reporting itself present).
+
+In some cases it may be necessary to describe non-probeable device
+details such as non-standard ways of powering up a device. In
+such cases, child nodes for those devices will be present as
+slaves of the slimbus-controller, as detailed below.
+
+Required property for SLIMbus child node if it is present:
+- reg		- Is Duplex (Device index, Instance ID) from Enumeration
+		  Address.
+		  Device Index Uniquely identifies multiple Devices within
+		  a single Component.
+		  Instance ID Is for the cases where multiple Devices of the
+		  same type or Class are attached to the bus.
+
+- compatible	-"slimMID,PID". The textual representation of Manufacturer ID,
+	 	  Product Code, shall be in lower case hexadecimal with leading
+		  zeroes suppressed
+
+SLIMbus example for Qualcomm's slimbus manager component:
+
+	slim@28080000 {
+		compatible = "qcom,slim-msm";
+		reg = <0x28080000 0x2000>,
+		interrupts = <0 33 0>;
+		clocks = <&lcc SLIMBUS_SRC>, <&lcc AUDIO_SLIMBUS_CLK>;
+		clock-names = "iface_clk", "core_clk";
+		#address-cells = <2>;
+		#size-cells = <0>;
+
+		codec: wcd9310@1{
+			compatible = "slim217,60"";
+			reg = <1 0>;
+		};
+	};

+Overview of Linux kernel SLIMbus support
+========================================
+
+What is SLIMbus?
+----------------
+SLIMbus (Serial Low Power Interchip Media Bus) is a specification developed by
+MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) alliance. The bus uses master/slave
+configuration, and is a 2-wire multi-drop implementation (clock, and data).
+
+Currently, SLIMbus is used to interface between application processors of SoCs
+(System-on-Chip) and peripheral components (typically codec).SLIMbus uses
+Time-Division-Multiplexing to accommodate multiple data channels, and
+a control channel.
+
+The control channel is used for various control functions such as bus
+management, configuration and status updates.These messages can be unicast (e.g.
+reading/writing device specific values), or multicast (e.g. data channel
+reconfiguration sequence is a broadcast message announced to all devices)
+
+A data channel is used for data-transfer between 2 Slimbus devices. Data
+channel uses dedicated ports on the device.
+
+Hardware description:
+---------------------
+Slimbus specification has different types of device classifications based on
+their capabilities.
+A manager device is responsible for enumeration, configuration, and dynamic
+channel allocation. Every bus has 1 active manager.
+
+A generic device is a device providing application functionality (e.g. codec).
+
+Framer device is responsible for clocking the bus, and transmitting frame-sync
+and framing information on the bus.
+
+Each SLIMbus component has an interface device for monitoring physical layer.
+
+Typically each SoC contains SLIMbus component having 1 manager, 1 framer device,
+1 generic device (for data channel support), and 1 interface device.
+External peripheral SLIMbus component usually has 1 generic device (for
+functionality/data channel support), and an associated interface device.
+The generic device's registers are mapped as 'value elements' so that they can
+be written/read using Slimbus control channel exchanging control/status type of
+information.
+In case there are multiple framer devices on the same bus, manager device is
+responsible to select the active-framer for clocking the bus.
+
+Per specification, Slimbus uses "clock gears" to do power management based on
+current frequency and bandwidth requirements. There are 10 clock gears and each
+gear changes the Slimbus frequency to be twice its previous gear.
+
+Each device has a 6-byte enumeration-address and the manager assigns every
+device with a 1-byte logical address after the devices report presence on the
+bus.
+
+Software description:
+---------------------
+There are 2 types of SLIMbus drivers:
+
+slim_controller represents a 'controller' for SLIMbus. This driver should
+implement duties needed by the SoC (manager device, associated
+interface device for monitoring the layers and reporting errors, default
+framer device).
+
+slim_device represents the 'generic device/component' for SLIMbus, and a
+slim_driver should implement driver for that slim_device.
+
+Device notifications to the driver:
+-----------------------------------
+Since SLIMbus devices have mechanisms for reporting their presence, the
+framework allows drivers to bind when corresponding devices report their
+presence on the bus.
+However, it is possible that the driver needs to be probed
+first so that it can enable corresponding SLIMbus devie (e.g. power it up and/or
+take it out of reset). To support that behavior, the framework allows drivers
+to probe first as well  (e.g. using standard DeviceTree compatbility field).
+This creates the necessity for the driver to know when the device is functional
+(i.e. reported present). device_up callback is used for that reason when the
+device reports present and is assigned a logical address by the controller.
+
+Similarly, SLIMbus devices 'report absent' when they go down. A 'device_down'
+callback notifies the driver when the device reports absent and its logical
+address assignment is invalidated by the controller.
+
+Another notification "boot_device" is used to notify the slim_driver when
+controller resets the bus. This notification allows the driver to take necessary
+steps to boot the device so that it's functional after the bus has been reset.
+
+Clock-pause:
+------------
+SLIMbus mandates that a reconfiguration sequence (known as clock-pause) be
+broadcast to all active devices on the bus before the bus can enter low-power
+mode. Controller uses this sequence when it decides to enter low-power mode so
+that corresponding clocks and/or power-rails can be turned off to save power.
+Clock-pause is exited by waking up framer device (if controller driver initiates
+exiting low power mode), or by toggling the data line (if a slave device wants
+to initiate it).
+
+Messaging APIs:
+---------------
+The framework supports APIs to exchange control-information with a SLIMbus
+device. APIs can be synchronous or asynchronous.
+From controller's perspective, multiple buffers can be queued to/from
+hardware for sending/receiving data using slim_ctrl_buf circular buffer.
+The header file <linux/slimbus.h> has more documentation about messaging APIs.
+
+-----------------------------------------------------------------
+<Sections will be added to this document when port/channel bandwidth management
+support, multi-xfer APIs are added to the framework>

+ *	allocation, channel setup, and port associations per channel.
+ *	Device management means Logical address assignment/removal based on
+ *	enumeration (report-present, report-absent) if a device.
+ *	Bandwidth allocation is done dynamically by the manager based on active
+ *	channels on the bus, message-bandwidth requests made by slimbus devices.
+ *	Based on current bandwidth usage, manager chooses a frequency to run
+ *	the bus at (in steps of 'clock-gear', 1 through 10, each clock gear
+ *	representing twice the frequency than the previous gear).
+ *	Manager is also responsible for entering (and exiting) low-power-mode
+ *	(known as 'clock pause').
+ *	Manager can do handover of framer if there are multiple framers on the
+ *	bus and a certain usecase warrants using certain framer to avoid keeping
+ *	previous framer being powered-on.
+ *
+ *	Controller here performs duties of the manager device, and 'interface
+ *	device'. Interface device is responsible for monitoring the bus and
+ *	reporting information such as loss-of-synchronization, data
+ *	slot-collision.
+ * @dev: Device interface to this driver

+ * @list: Link with other slimbus controllers
+ * @name: Name for this controller

+ * @a_framer: Active framer which is clocking the bus managed by this controller
+ * @m_ctrl: Mutex protecting controller data structures
+ * @addrt: Logical address table
+ * @num_dev: Number of active slimbus slaves on this bus
+ * @wq: Workqueue per controller used to notify devices when they report present
+ * @xfer_msg: Transfer a message on this controller (this can be a broadcast
+ *	control/status message like data channel setup, or a unicast message
+ *	like value element read/write.
+ * @set_laddr: Setup logical address at laddr for the slave with elemental
+ *	address e_addr. Drivers implementing controller will be expected to
+ *	send unicast message to this device with its logical address.
+ * @get_laddr: It is possible that controller needs to set fixed logical
+ *	address table and get_laddr can be used in that case so that controller
