I don't understand this. Are you referring to the old clock system? Or
to the proposed SCPI approach? Or to sunxi-ng with DT descriptions?

And why would a *driver* care about a specific clock if it's using the
common clock framework?
Confused ...

Again which new clock drivers? The old sunxi-clks?
For the SCPI version I propose we don't need any ACKs (apart from the
new .dtsi, maybe), because the clocks are already there.

We don't need to comply with some common clock framework in firmware, we
just need to provide implementations for specific clocks. From a
maintainer's point of view the CCF is nice, but its implementation is
quite complicated and hard to understand for mere mortals. Also tweaking
a particular clock is not easy, as it has to fit into the framework and
we may miss the interfaces.

See the MMC clock implementation for instance: it's just a simple
divider clock. My implementation in ATF is probably bad and stupid, but
at the end of the day I just have to provide a way to set a frequency of
one single clock.
I think we win a lot if we go away from possibly tuning the parent's
clocks (AHB, PLL6 & friends), instead leaving them as fixed clocks - my
understanding is that Allwinner recommends this anyway. Then the whole
complex clock tree degrades into just a bunch of more or less
independent clock registers.
Also we can go with a much easier implementation, since we don't need to
support all clocks in one image, but just the clocks for one particular
SoC. This brings the complexity down, so we can get away with a much
simpler implementation (compare U-Boot, though this isn't the best
example, admittedly).

But currently distributions do upgrade U-Boot, don't they? ATF would be
part of a FIT image, compiled alongside U-Boot and included in one image
with the SPL and the U-Boot proper. In the Allwinner world with firmware
on SD cards or in eMMC I don't see big issues.
Also honestly I don't expect frequent updates. Yes: in the beginning we
may have changes, but at some point we make a (tested) release and maybe
publish updates every now and then. Either these updates fix bugs or
provide new features, so there is some incentive for users to update. Or
they don't care, in which case it may just work for them and they keep
using the old version.

I wasn't referring to SCPI in particular (which is indeed used only by
Juno at the moment), but about not exposing the actual internal clock
layout to Linux. PCs certainly don't, but also AMD Seattle and ThunderX
avoid this.

I don't see that these are related - unless you consider the DT part of
the kernel - which it clearly isn't (although the current scheme of DT
updates suggests this). Actually the firmware should provide the DT,
just advertising all the clocks it implements.
And as I don't expect implementing an isolated clock as an SCPI clock to
be rocket science, I'd hope for the error rate to be minimal.
So we may publish an early firmware version with support for certain
devices only and later upgrade this. U-Boot gets also upgraded via the
distributions at the moment. We could even introduce some firmware
upgrade infrastructure (or use the Linux one) if we find us in dire need
for.

Again how does this differ from U-Boot, which I consider firmware as
well and which is handled by the distributions (although I don't like
this approach very much, because it pushes hardware support to Linux
vendors).

I can understand that we can just do what we did in the past: Spoon feed
every new SoC as soon as we get our hands on some boards and explicitly
add support for it in the Linux kernel.
But I'd like to revisit this approach, as it actually takes quite some
time for support to trickle in down the kernel road - especially if we
look at major distributions (think LTS).
If we can get closer to a state were new SoCs just require appropriate
firmware and a DT - without any new kernel code - I see a big
opportunity to get much quicker support for new SoCs - up to a point
where the firmware is the only thing that's needed. Maybe some day the
board vendors provide these firmware bits even, who knows?

Another thing that strikes me: Currently we have strict per-SoC pinctrl
drivers, which is unfortunate. But now we are adding new clock
_descriptions_ for new SoCs as well, partly degrading the DT to a mere
"board file selector". IIRC Linus complained about those numerous clock
updates for ARM boards back then in his big ARM rant, I am just afraid
that we go back to this state, bloating the kernel with SoC specific
clock details - that it not necessarily needs to know about. In the end
the kernel just wants to program this MMC clock to 52 MHz.
