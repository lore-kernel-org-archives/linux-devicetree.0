Sure, I'll change this.

I was trying to follow the guideline that kernel C source files should use
C style comments while at the same time following the SPDX guideline that
C++ style comments are needed for the SPDX line in C source files [1].

I'll change this.

My thinking here was to have a consistent mapping for consumers to use
between REGULATOR_MODE_* and physical regulator modes for both LDO and
SMPS type regulators:

REGULATOR_MODE_STANDBY --> Retention (if supported)
REGULATOR_MODE_IDLE    --> Low power mode (if supported)
                           LPM for LDO and PFM for SMPS
REGULATOR_MODE_NORMAL  --> Auto HW switching between low and high power
                           mode (if supported)
REGULATOR_MODE_FAST    --> High power mode
                           HPM for LDO and PWM for SMPS

This allows a consumer to request NORMAL in typical use cases and FAST in
use cases that require low voltage ripple.  If NORMAL is not supported,
then it automatically gets upgraded to FAST by the regulator framework.

I could change it so that REGULATOR_MODE_NORMAL maps to LDO HPM mode.
However, doing so would make it so that REGULATOR_MODE_FAST requests would
fail for LDOs.  Thus, consumers would need to know if their supply is an
LDO or an SMPS (which seems undesirable).

Would it be acceptable to have both NORMAL and FAST map to LDO HPM?

LDO type regulators physically do not support AUTO mode.  That is why I
specified REGULATOR_MODE_INVALID in the mapping.

I'll change this.
