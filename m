I think its better to add the comment when its actually applicable, even
if it needs to be a separate patch.

This disabling later should not happen because you have the timer clocks
marked as LPSC_ALWAYS_ENABLED which translates to CLK_IS_CRITICAL and
that should make sure they are never disabled.

The issue should be documented is that we depend on bootloader leaving
the timer0 enabled on DM355, DM365, DM644x and DM646x. Of these, I have
tested only DM644x so far. I will check others and see the status of
timer0 there.

Its not really a great situation here, but I don't have a good
alternative to suggest as well if having genpd support in PSC means we
cannot be using CLK_OF_DECLARE().

Thanks,
