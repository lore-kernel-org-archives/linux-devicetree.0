I am not aware of interrupts associated with vanilla :) "arm,arch-cache"
objects, so I think that should be handled as a "qcom,krait" specific property
(in the cpu node), or you should add another cache binding (compatible) for
that.

As you might have noticed (idle states thread) I am keen on defining objects
for L1 caches explicitly, that patch still requires an ACK though (and
you need to update it since you cannot add an interrupt property for all
"arm,arch-cache" objects. I am sorry for being a pain, but I do not
think that's correct from a HW description standpoint).

It seems fine to me, but it requires an ACK from platform bus and DT
maintainers.
