After all it most likely depends on the firmware loaded since it is the config ram space that this changes.

Ah I see, so you suggest simply putting an identifier
in the DT which we then use to build the config-file
filename to request. That pretty much matches with what
I have in mind for the x86 code-paths as well as for
the somewhat related broadcom wifi nvram files.

So yes that sounds like a good idea.

With that said, given that I'm only testing this on x86
I think that for v2 of the patch-set it is probably best
to just drop the DT specific bits. Then when someone
comes along who wants to add the necessary glue for DT
based platforms they can brush the dust of the DT specific
patches and submit an actually tested version of them.

So for v2 I plan to just drop the DT bits and add a
patch to use the ACPI HID as an identifier in the
config-file filename requested on ACPI platforms.

I remember that some .hcd files contain also HCI commands to do extra settings. Maybe we need a tool that shows the details of these files. We have this for nokfw and rtlfw now.

I'm using hcd files for broadcom.
