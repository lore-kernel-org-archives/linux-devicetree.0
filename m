Hello,

As part of an automated build of the Debian Linux kernel packages I
think we have observed a race (or at least some unexpected extra
recursion) in the handling of dtb-subdirs vs subdirs-y in
arch/arm64/boot/dts when using make -j<N>.

Looking at the log at [0] and removing the unrelated stuff happening
due to other parallelism we see:

Where it appears that multiple instance of __dtbs_install_prep have
been running in parallel at least the apm and arm subdirectories of
arch/arm64/boot/dts, with both of them then racing in the=A0
    $(Q)if [ -d $(INSTALL_DTBS_PATH) ]; then mv $(INSTALL_DTBS_PATH) $(IN=
STALL_DTBS_PATH).old; fi
rule since apparently $(INSTALL_DTBS_PATH) existed during the "-d"
check but had gone by the time of the move. The build is in an
automated buildd pristine environment with INSTALL_DTBS_PATH pointing
to a brand new directory, so for $(INSTALL_DTBS_PATH) to exist at all
there must have been a third instance of __dtbs_install_prep earlier
which created it.

I understand that the mv bit of the rule in question is likely to be
removed quite soon[1] but I think the underlying race / extra recursion
still exits and might have other implications.

Ben and I have hypothesised that this is because
arch/arm64/boot/dts/Makefile has:

    subdir-y=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0:=3D $(dts-dirs)

which means that dtbs_install recurses twice, once due to the dts-dirs
handling in scripts/Makefile.dtbinst rules (via $(dtbsinst-dirs)) and
once again for the (generic) subdir-y handling. BTW many of the subdir
Makefiles have the same construct, I'm not sure why since they have no
sub-sub-dirs, although it seems more harmless in that context.

By my reading the __dtbs_install_prep rule is supposed to run once as
part of arch/*/boot/dts/Makefile and not as part of any each of the
subdirectories.

I've experimented with removing the subdir-y assignment, but that seems
to break the dtbs and clean rules.

I'm not sure how else this can/should be fixed with Kbuild. Any ideas?

Thanks,
Ian.
