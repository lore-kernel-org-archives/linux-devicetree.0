No, you're missing the point - why not set the sample rate based on the
sample rate the interface is running at?

What I'm saying is that this should not be selectable by the user at
runtime.  It's not like the user is going to open their system and start
soldering links onto the board or anything.

If the user can't reconfigure the stream while it's running the user
shouldn't be able to reconfigure the stream while it's running - we
should block the change if it can't be implemented.  Then the user can
make the change while the interface is idle and and=20

This explains what the data is but not why you have chosen to use
atomics to do this; what other concurrency primitives were considered,
why were they rejected and what's the analysis that shows how the use of
atomics is safe?

The ideal thing is to just not set it at all and use whatever the
hardware designers picked.
