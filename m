Agreed. Why can't we expand the size in DT and then access the
registers directly in the driver. Hopefully it keeps working to
apply the dts patch without the driver patch too (and
vice-versa), because the kernel can only make a mapping as small
as a page which would cover these newly added reg properties
anyway.
