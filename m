I wouldn't be surprised if you hit on a bug in v4l2-compliance. I 
stopped with v4l2-compliance
at a different test failure that also didn't make sense to me:

Streaming ioctls:
     test read/write: OK (Not Supported)
         Video Capture:
         Buffer: 0 Sequence: 0 Field: Any Timestamp: 41.664259s
         fail: 
.../v4l-utils-1.6.2/utils/v4l2-compliance/v4l2-test-buffers.cpp(281): 
!(g_flags() & (V4L2_BUF_FLAG_DONE | V4L2_BUF_FLAG_ERROR))
         fail: 
.../v4l-utils-1.6.2/utils/v4l2-compliance/v4l2-test-buffers.cpp(610): 
buf.check(q, last_seq)
         fail: 
.../v4l-utils-1.6.2/utils/v4l2-compliance/v4l2-test-buffers.cpp(883): 
captureBufs(node, q, m2m_q, frame_count, false)
     test MMAP: FAIL
     test USERPTR: OK (Not Supported)
     test DMABUF: Cannot test, specify --expbuf-device

Total: 42, Succeeded: 38, Failed: 4, Warnings: 0


In this case the driver completed and returned only one buffer, and it set
VB2_BUF_STATE_DONE, so these test failures didn't make sense to me. I
was using version 1.6.2 at the time.
