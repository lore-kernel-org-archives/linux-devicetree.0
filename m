In my opinion otg structure should belong to the USB core part that takes care
of the OTG/DRD state machine. We still don't have a clear solution here and
I'm currently investigating this.
My current work is to get Dual role functionality working with DWC3 controller and TI
platforms.

Currently phy drivers take care of OTG operation themselves but there is an opportunity
to share code and centralize USB role switching.
The USB core should be the owner of the Host controller, Gadget controller and the OTG phy
and should take care of the that.

I don't think PHY is the right place for this even though older drivers seem to be doing so.
But at the same time there is nowhere else to add this at the moment.
The right place should be the USB core that is aware of host/gadget, phy and the state of the bus.

I wrote the extcon-gpio-usb.c driver for exactly your use case. It is
queued for v4.1
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/2/2/187

It takes care of debouncing for you. Although currently it supports only ID gpio,
it should be very easy to extend to VBUS sense GPIO.

> I think I am still not understanding extcon-gpio, not sure why need use this API here.

several reasons. Let me list a few.
1) Code reuse. Every PHY driver doesn't need to implement GPIO/interrupt handling and debouncing.
It just registers what cable events it wants to hear and gets a notification.
2) The events (ID/VBUS) are not only interesting for the PHY driver but also the controller
driver and the OTG state machine (whenever it exists at a common place) ;).
3) standardization because of common API.
