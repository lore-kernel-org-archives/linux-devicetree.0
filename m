The delay is not just for the line-in/mic path it is also for the out
path. More technical, it is needed to charge the decouple capacity which
provides the voltage bias for the analog input/output frontends.

I found the: "ti,charge-period (sound/ti,tas5086.txt)" binding which
represents nearly the same but it is not common. One opportunity would be to
introduce a common "charge-period-us" binding and change the ti binding the
common binding later.

Would that be okay?
