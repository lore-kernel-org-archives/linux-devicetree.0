Okay. However, if this is common for QCom blocks maybe we should
reconsider. I think compatible makes sense if the programming model
changes.

Yes, in the dts you should use interrupts-extended. However, for
documentation purposes that aspect is not important. So we just use
interrupts most everywhere.
