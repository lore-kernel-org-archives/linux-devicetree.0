I can do that, Thanks

Frequency = (64xFs)/(N+2)
N = chgfreq value
Fs = sample rate

I can do that as well. Thanks

I can add a little more but it is best explained in the datasheet. I can 
add a little more explaination and reference the datasheet section. I feel 
this file might be the wrong place to go into too much depth of the pieces 
of the device when the datasheet could be referenced. Would a reference be 
OK?

I can change this as well.  While we are talking about coding style, is 
there a new format document somewhere with the style that was agreed to at 
the conference just recently?

Thanks,
Brian
