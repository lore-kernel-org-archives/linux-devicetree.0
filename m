All the parameters are only rate and format.
And even rate is implementation dependent. Knowing the name of the=20
hardware give nothing. You still have to look at the schematic or look=20
at the board to know valid rates.
Actually is anything but a PCM5102A codec driver. It is a driver for an=
=20
I2S device accepting PCM rate from 8khz to 192khz with bck rate of 48fs=
=20
or 64fs (32fs is normally supported too by the hw mode used in hifiberr=
y).

Yes this push more effort on the DT side, but I think this is better to=
=20
describe in DT the actual "I2S only" hardware capabilities of the=20
implementation of the device guided by wiring or design choice.
Doing code cut&paste and two static assignment adjustment to create a=20
"new" driver is completely overkill and nonflexible.

instead of the proposed dt, we could have :

/* pcm5102a in HW mode with external SCK (4wire mode)
  * at 128fs, 192fs or 256fs
  */
	pcm5102a-4w: pcm5102a {
		compatible =3D "simple-i2s-codec";
		rate =3D <SNDRV_PCM_RATE_8000_192000>;
		format =3D < SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_S16_LE
			|SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_S24_LE
			|SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_S32_LE>;
	};
or
/* pcm5102a in HW mode with PLL on BCK (3wire mode)
  * 16to384khz but only with bck rate of 64fs
  */
	pcm5102a-4w: pcm5102a {
		compatible =3D "simple-i2s-codec";
		rate =3D <SNDRV_PCM_RATE_8000_192000
			^ SNDRV_PCM_RATE_8000>;
		format =3D <SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_S32_LE>;
	};
Or
/* ES9023 in asynchronous mode mclk > 37Mhz
  * I did not try bck rate <64fs as the sabre family did not generally
  * support it.
  */
	es9023: es9023 {
		compatible =3D "simple-i2s-codec";
		rate =3D <SNDRV_PCM_RATE_8000_192000>;
		format =3D <SNDRV_PCM_FMTBIT_S32_LE>;
	};

We could use I2S friendly property instead of "format" :
		bckrates =3D <48, 64>;


With two or tree more property (gpio for mute, de-emphasis and filter=20
selection), you could cover 98% of I2S DAC with hardware only=20
interfaces. It cover too startup mode of most hifi I2C or SPI=20
controllable DAC. Which is a good starting point for chip for which a=20
driver is not already written.
