I think this is going to be too big of a hammer for pinctrl at least.
My current thought is to define a pinctrl DT property to indicate pins
are configured already which the OS can use to decide if pinctrl is
optional or not. I'd prefer to keep it simple and be a per pin
controller flag even though this is quite possibly a per client or pin
group state (as you say, the bootloader may only configure what it
uses). Making this per pin group could be a lot of nodes and difficult
to really get right without testing. Making it per pin controller
could make drivers fail in less predictable ways if their pins are not
configured.
