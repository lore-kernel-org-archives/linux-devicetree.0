IMHO, FreeBSD also ships some GPL'ed software.

As the DTS/DTB is an entirely separate entity, I don't see any
conflict or viral effect here. Of course, if they patch something
here, these patches would fall under the GPL (as with all the other
GPL'ed packages).

Yes, that's the whole purpose of the GPL. The deal is pretty simple:
if you take some GPL'ed software and change it, you'll have to publish
your changes under the same rules. For entirely separate entities
(eg. dedicated programs) that's not an big issue. And for libraries,
we have LGPL.

If the DTS license would be a problem, it would be worse w/ ACPI
and any proprietary firmware/BIOSes.

What's the big deal here ?

The dts patches will fall under GPL, the others on whichever license
the other code has.

In that particular case, he doesn't need to - just publish the patches
under the same license as the original was.

I see the problem from a different side: certain companies simply dont
wanna play by the rules - they wanna take the benefits of FOSS (and get
it for free - like free beer), but then refuse to give anything back.
Those folks instead should buy something proprietary.

Aggreed at this point.
But that's IMHO an entirely different discussion.
(quite similiar to the discussion, whether udev should be bundled
or separate from systemd)

> But think of it like a BIOS on your PC.

I'd rather not think about BIOS and PC at all :p
The situation here is so ugly that I'd rather wish an own law for
enforcing these things as FOSS.

I really wish, DTS (yes source! not just binary) would replace BIOS and
ACPI completely, so I could simply run my own bootloader (eg. barebox).
Compared with x86, the ARM world (even with its thousands of different
SoCs and boards) is quite easy ;-o

> You wouldn't want to have that BIOS project driven by a single OS,

If that project would be the official Linux kernel, I'd actually be
pretty happy about that. Way better than all the UEFI crap.

Well, more careful than all these board vendors with the broken
BIOSes ... :p

We're just talking about one file (per board type), which is entirely
separate from the actually running OS (besides the fact, that DT-source
traditionally ships with the linux source tree).

OS vendors dont need to care about its license, just like they dont
need to care about the dozens BIOS licenses.

But board vendors need to care. And that's exactly the are which really
needs to be freed (free like freedom), because it is so vital. The whol=
e
UEFI/TC debacle clearly shows that we *need* free firmware, because
sooner or later the boards will simply refuse to boot alternative OSes.

YES: this whole issue has a big political dimension. And that's why the
GPL had been invented in the first place. It's not just about sharing
ideas and code, it's about freedom. Goethe has written about this over
200 years ago, and today it's more valid than ever.

And the Linux kernel is probably the most advanced (general-use)
kernel, scaling from tiny embedded stuff to big super clusters.
The development momentum is so huge here, that it (technically) doesn't
make any sense to roll an own projects. For the DTB stuff - anybody can
just use and ship it. Even commercial vendors like Microsoft could do
that - I don't see any problem here.

I only see one practical usecase for and BSD-licensed DTS: to allow
people (eg. board vendors) to close down their own branch. And that's
exactly what the GPL shall prevent.

I *am* an developer, and I know how the GPL works. And I *am* often
developing for my customers. License problems with FOSS licenses just
arise when you're going to mix code under different licenes or link
libraries. Both aren't the case for DTS.

Except for one scenario: if you want to compile-in the DTB into some
proprietary blob. I'd consider that an invalid usecase. Technically
a bad idea. One might wanna do that for just one reason: to make
hard for other people (IOW: the folks who buy the devices, therefore
then are the *owners* of them). And that's exactly GPL shall prevent.

 > you tend to prefer that way because most developers are not lawyers

I'm also not a lawyer. But, as my math teacher, back in school,
used to say: read the text.

It's really not that complicated at all, once you got used to the
language - basicly just like learning a new programming language.
In fact, legal stuff and software engineering is pretty much the same
(legal systems just tend to have a higher grade of indeterminism)
Actually, I know lots of former lawyers who're now software engineers
and vice versa. Oh, and legal hacking can be great fun ;-)

 > and don't have the money to consult them.

Not necessary. Better spend some time and study the texts yourself,
instead of just blindly trusting somebody else's oppinion. Not so
different from reading source code.

And I'd highly recommend everybody to do that - even for daily life.

(oh, and if anybody likes to have some tips here, feel free to ask.
I can't give any real legal advice, as some still practised Nazi
law forbids that, if you're not an licensed attourney)

I'm not scared about that at all, and I don't see why anybody should be=
=2E
If some board vendor (as already done in x86 world) goes the ACPI route=
,
we can either reverse engineer the stuff (and write proper DTS'es) or
simply boycott their products, let them starve.

But thats the big danger with licenses that allow closing down
the source.

In case of DTS/DTB, there's no need for changing the license for
that purpose - it's an separate entity anyways.

Sure. But often, it's just the pure unwillingness for cooperation.
BSD license easily allows that - you dont need to publish your changes.
Most of the time, such decisions are made by people, who know nothing
about software engineering. If we have an viral copyleft license, like
GPL, those people are quite easy to convince (especially regarding the
fact, that the companies in question usually aren't software vendors)

Yes, and exactly that works pretty fine. *With* GPL.
Most of my clients wouldn't do this on their own, if there wasn't
an legal requirement.

There isn't anything like that on my SoC. It has some tiny logic
(in cpu microcode), which just reads a few blocks via SPI (emmc,
sd, etc, depending on some pin configurations) and directly jumps
into it. The boodloader is barebox, with some own patches, compiled
own my own.

That's how I also would like to have it on x86.

Well, it obviously needs some specified interface (eg. CPU's opcodes,
register specs on perhiphals, etc, etc). If I don't get the proper spec=
s
for that, it's pretty much useless for me.

=46or example, on my current mx53 system, I can't use the GPUs due to l=
ack
of specs.

 > or you build your own hardware, CPU etc.

Actually, that's already in the pipeline. Will be an entirely
different architecture, more like a huge transputer grid ... but that's
going to be off-topic ...

Yes, and I need to know exactly how to do that initialization, so I can
put my own firmware/bootloader in here. Maybe even an XIP kernel.

> You have to decide what's acceptable to you. We all do that.

Yes, and I made the decision, that I can't tolerate any proprietary
code - not on mission critical embedded systems.
