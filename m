I did that because I tried to keep node-name generic as described in the DT
spec. The idea of numbering the nodes (without a reg property) in such a way
came from :
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/simple-card.txt:
=> look at the multi dai link example. I'm doing exactly the same on the axg
card's dai-links. Nothing new here.

that being said, section 2.2.1 of the DT specs says:

" If the node has no reg property, the @unit-address must be omitted and the
node-name alone differentiates the node from other nodes at the same level in
the tree "

So apparently, this is used but not ok ?
I could make 'linein' the node-name instead of the label but that wouldn't be
very generic.
We could also have dai-link-2 instead dai-link@2 (audio-codec-3 instead of 
audio-codec@3). I seems to be OK with the spec, but it also looks weird ...

Rob, do you have opinion on this ?

This string is used to prefix the name of the different widgets and controls
provided. It is useful when several devices provides component and control with
the same names. It happens when several instances of a component are used but
also with classic names, such as "Playback"

I don't think there is a rule regarding capitalization.
Some name are all capital in ASoC, some just have the first letter in upper
case. It doesn't change anything technically, and I personally don't care.
