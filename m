You're right, this needs to be consistent. So I would like us to update
the existing nodes,

I discussed the matter with my colleagues and we concluded that we want
to keep the muxing in the platform.dtsi and move the specification of
the electrical properties (pinconf) to the board.dts(i).

We did discuss having some "default values" in the platform file, but
pushing these down to the board file gives an indication to others that
these values are board specific.


PS. If you're willing to provide a patch for the existing nodes I would
be happy to review this as well!
