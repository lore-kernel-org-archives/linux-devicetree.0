It not a codec but a simple I2S DAC.
No I2S master mode.
Like most DAC before the CODEC era and all the big mess around them.
In the ES9023 case, the MCLK could either have no frequency an no phase =

relationship with the I2S clocks.
In this case, the MCLK is surely derived from a clock of the Rpi SOC so =

you are right, and the whole HifiBerry driver should be rewritten with =

proper abstraction like Mark suggested : Clock binding etc ...
But now as Mark say too, clock api integration is a goal, but not there.
The proposed hw param rules is a start to not have to write specific =

machine driver because of clocking constraints.
It is the second time I am scratching my head because of clocking =

constraints and because I want to do something better than writing =

another trivial machine driver.
In my case (BBB or other Ti soc using mcasp) I will have to had =

mux/clk_set_parent switching action and/or clk_set_rate action. But I am =

not persuaded that is it the way to go.

That why, by the time we get proper clock api integration with proper =

constraint and constraint description mechanism, a simple DT =

configurable codec driver in which we push the resulting constraint =

(DAC+SOC+design choice) was appealing.

But you are all right. This is not the long term proper way. And the =

actual ultra simple PCM510xA driver could evolve to support all GPIO and =

later properly express all his clock constraints independently of the =

implementation choices.

Thank your for your patience.

Emmanuel.
