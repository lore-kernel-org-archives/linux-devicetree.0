Looking at how the DTSI patch structures things (without going into
whether it is correct or accurate):

The D-PHY is not part of the component graph. However it requests
the DSI gate clock from the TCON-TOP.

The TCON-TOP driver, in its current form, only registers the clocks
it provides at component bind time. Thus the D-PHY can't successfully
probe until the TCON-TOP has been bound.

The DSI interface requires the D-PHY to bind. It will return -EPROBE_DEFER
if it cannot request it. This in turn goes into the error path of
component_bind_all, which unbinds all previous components.

So it's actually

    D-PHY -> TCON-TOP -> DSI
      ^                   |
      |--------------------

I've not checked, but I suspect there's no possibility of having other
drivers probe (to deal with deferred probing) within component_bind_all.
Otherwise we shouldn't run into this weird circular dependency issue.

So the question for Jagan is that is this indeed the case? Does this
patch solve it, or at least work around it.
