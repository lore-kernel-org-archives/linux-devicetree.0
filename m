If you have a nominally-64-bit device with a 
narrower-than-the-main-interconnect link in front of it, that should 
already be fixed in 4.19-rc by bus_dma_mask picking up DT dma-ranges, 
provided the interconnect hierarchy can be described appropriately (or 
at least massaged sufficiently to satisfy the binding), e.g.:

/ {
	...

	soc {
		ranges;
		dma-ranges = <0 0 10000 0>;

		dev_48bit { ... };

		periph_bus {
			ranges;
			dma-ranges = <0 0 100 0>;

			dev_40bit { ... };
		};
	};
};

and if that fails to work as expected (except for PCI hosts where 
handling dma-ranges properly still needs sorting out), please do let us 
know ;)
