Also I forgot to clean-up the headers list from the previous iterations.

It was a platform driver in the first versions but I changed to this
form after Rob suggested to have it in the /firmware node and without
compatibility to the "simple-bus".

yeah, better I think

Agree

Probably it's better to stay on the safe side and just to rule !4K
kernels out with Kconfig

Yes, the meson_sm_get_fw() was used to enforce probe ordering when the
driver was a platform driver. Since this is now probed on
device_initcall() I think we can safely remove this.

ouch, right

Since Rob required this to be under /firmware (and using no "simple-bus"
compatible to trigger the automatic creation) making it a platform
driver just adds a lot of boilerplate code. If this doesn't mean a NACK
on your side, I still would leave the code as is with the
device_initcall() calling the init.

Not really, as written before that was used to enforce probe ordering.
I'll take that out in the next revision.
