I was actually referring to ranges within the PCI *device* (~leaf node).
So not thinking about mvebu, but rather about general PCI devices.

I see drivers/of/address.c implements some:

extern const __be32 *of_get_pci_address(struct device_node *dev, int bar_no,
			       u64 *size, unsigned int *flags);
extern int of_pci_address_to_resource(struct device_node *dev, int bar,
				      struct resource *r);

Which are not hooked to any ranges (of_bus) mechanisms nor any DT-aware 
PCI device driver and that's where I got completely lost.
But I'm probably looking at it from a wrong perspective.

Thanks,
Gerlando
