The Qualcomm Technologies HIDMA device has been designed
to support virtualization technology. The driver has been
divided into two to follow the hardware design.

1. HIDMA Management driver
2. HIDMA Channel driver

Each HIDMA HW consists of multiple channels. These channels
share some set of common parameters. These parameters are
initialized by the management driver during power up.
Same management driver is used for monitoring the execution
of the channels. Management driver can change the performance
behavior dynamically such as bandwidth allocation and
prioritization in the future.

The management driver is executed in hypervisor context and
is the main management entity for all channels provided by
the device.

* Clean up style issues
* make depend on CONFIG_OF_IRQ too as SPARC arch doesn't seem to define
CONFIG_OF_IRQ but it defines CONFIG_OF.
