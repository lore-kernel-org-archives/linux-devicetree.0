I did address your comment in v5? The helper no longer tries to read
"name" property if the callback fails.

That is a fair point. I choose to not to convert
fwnode_get_named_child_node() to use this helper because it would mean
we would have to allocate the buffer there, and I don't know if it's
worth it.

Let's forget about this for now. I was planning to use this helper for
matching a requested remote-endpoint (graph) device, but I'm not sure
if the node name is usable there.

I'll resend these as part of a real user for the API, if I ever have
one.
