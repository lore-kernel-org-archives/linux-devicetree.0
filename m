I'm kinda in the middle on this topic. I agree with Sakari that
frame rate can fluctuate, but that should only be temporary. If
the frame rate permanently shifts from what a subdev reports via
g_frame_interval, then that is a system problem. So I agree with
Phillip and Russell that a link validation of frame interval still
makes sense.

But I also have to agree with Sakari that a subdev that has no
control over frame rate has no business implementing those ops.

And then I agree with Russell that for subdevs that do have control
over frame rate, they would have to walk the graph to find the frame
rate source.

So we're stuck in a broken situation: either the subdevs have to walk
the graph to find the source of frame rate, or s_frame_interval
would have to be mandatory and validated between pads, same as set_fmt.
