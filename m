If the attempt to read id registers will not hang the system, it can
work. Like the case [1], without PHY ref_clk, it will hang when
configure PHY mode (visit portsc.pts), it has no chance to read id
registers. So, I still think the ULPI bus driver needs to do power
sequence for its children, unless you have some place to open the
ref_clk.

For this patch, it is ok for me.
