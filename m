[This is an updated version of my previous RFC, which can be found at
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2012-October/128205.html]

Current devicetree bindings for devices which use cpu-affine shared interrupts
assume that interrupts are listed in ascending order of physical cpu id
(MPIDR.Aff{2,1,0}). This is problematic for drivers because:

(1) The driver must convert each physical id to a logical id for the purpose of
    managing interrupts.

(2) In multi-cluster systems the physical ids are not necessarily contiguous,
    and drivers cannot simply iterate over ids from 0 to NR_CPUS.

(3) It is not possible to specify sets of interrupts which are wired to a
    subset of cpus (i.e. clusters) not starting at physical id 0, as we can't
    specify which cpu to start from, and can't skip cpus. This makes it
    impossible to represent some devices (e.g. cpu PMUs) which may not exist
    in the first cluster.

(4) Some devices may either be wired with PPIs or SPIs. It is not possible to
    differentiate the two cases in general from the interrupts list (e.g. when
    a device has multiple PPIs wired to all cpus).

To represent the general case, we require a mechanism to describe the cpu
affinity of a device, and a consistent way to map each interrupt to a cpu (or
set of cpus). So far, the only workable mechanism I've been able to come up
with is the following:

In addition to the interrupts list we add an optional 'interrupts-affinity'
list which describes how to map an interrupt to cpu(s). Each interrupt would
have a corresponding element in the interrupts-affinity list.

Each element consists of a pair of cells specifying how to test if a cpu is
affine. This test specification consists of a most significant affinity level
to match, and values for the MPIDR affinity bits down to this level. Each pair
of cells has the form:

    < N 0x00AABBCC >
       \   \ \ \ \__ MPIDR.Aff0
        \   \ \ \___ MPIDR.Aff1
         \   \ \____ MPIDR.Aff2
          \   \_____ [must be zero]
           \________ level-specifier

The level-specifier is in the range [0-3]. When the value is 3, MPIDR affinity
levels 2,1,0 are ignored, and thus all cpus are matched. When the value is 0,
levels 2,1,0 must all be matched for a cpu to be considered affine. Affinity
bits which are not to be matched should be set to zero.

In practice, use of the binding would look something like:

> device@0 {
> 	compatible = "example,example-affine-device";
> 	interrupts = <0 130 4>,
> 	             <0 131 4>,
> 	             <1 12 4>;
> 	interrupts-affinity = <0 0x00000000>,
>	                      <0 0x00000001>,
> 	                      <1 0x00000100>;
> };

To request/free interrupts, drivers would walk over all interrupts, and request
the affine cpu(s), which can be automatically mapped to logical ids by common
code. This fixes issues 1, 2, and 3. 4 is partially solved, in that we know
whether an interrupt is targeted at a single cpu or multiple cpus (i.e.
whether it's an SPI or a PPI), but we can't differentiate multiple interrupts
targeted at the same cpu. We could solve this with an additional
"interrupt-names" property, or something of that sort.

The following patches implement common code that could be used by drivers to
deal with this affinity information, allowing drivers to extract a (logical)
cpumask specifying the affinity of each interrupt, and additional information
specifying whether an interrupt targets multiple cpus.

The patches are based on rmk's for-next branch.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
Mark.
