I had read all the emails interaction. Yes I can write a single EDAC
driver. But I actually have multiple instances and single instance of
the same IP's. For example, I have 4 DDR controllers, 4 CPU domains,
one L3 and one SoC. If you can suggest to me how this would work with
devicetree, I might be able to make it works. But from HW point of
view (take the memory controller as an example), there is really 4
hardware blocks and some shared IP's block for status. It is much
simple representation with multiple instance of the driver. In
addition, should one day we have 6 memory controllers, I would just
add two more instances in the DT node.

I think we should first agreed on the DT binding and let's not worry
about APEI. Then, whether we have one file or multiple file. Again,
the HW consist of:

1. One top level interrupt and status registers
2. CSW, MCB A and MCB B for detection of any active memory controllers
3. 4 individual memory controller instance
4. 4 CPU domain instance with its own individual L2 registers
5. Each CPU has instance own L1
6. One L3 instance
7. One SoC instance

As for as what is useful, we find that the memory controller and the
L1 and L2 are useful as it provides info for errors - for HW/system
debugging as well as margin of DDR.
