I know. That doesn't mean it is good practice or not in need of
refactoring as fwnode API expands.

That helps absolutely nothing.

What do you mean by manipulating? A fwnode should be statically
pointing to a DT node and the DT node is static.

4 or 8 bytes, really?

It was, but you're adding a lot.

I'd guess the problem is V4L2 has common graph code and DRM does not.
I'd also guess we can find common patterns in both that could be
abstracted. And as you noticed, ALSA folks are working on using OF
graph.

I think generally we want drivers to avoid walking the port and
endpoint nodes themselves. Rather, have functions like "For my device
node, give me the device node connected via port N, endpoint M."
Essentially, that is of_graph_get_endpoint_by_regs and
of_graph_get_remote_port_parent. The only time drivers really should
have port or endpoint node ptrs is to read properties, so maybe we add
property retrieval functions that take the device node and port and
endpoint numbers.

Really it may be an exercise in just removing some of the functions
which are too low level.

Take of_cal_create_instance() as an example. Here's what it does:

- Find port with reg == inst
- Get port's first endpoint
- Get remote port parent and save sensor_node
- Get the remote endpoint node
- Parse the remote endpoint properties (v4l2_of_parse_endpoint)

The first 3 steps are 40 lines of code and could be just 1 function
call returning node ptr for sensor_node.

v4l2_of_parse_link also open codes stuff that should be in the core.

Right, I had similar comments there.
