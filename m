What do you mean ? The binding provides a way to describe arbitrary
register fields and expose them to userspace. I'm not sure what you
mean by backward compatibility.

There is simply no way these things can be "abstracted" via some kind
of nice layered Linux subsystem of some sort. It's just a whole bunch
of knobs that control various things integral to the operation of the
host system. Andrew can provide a more precise list if you need to.

Register *field*. I think you are looking at this from the wrong angle.
This isn't about exposing 236821643 SoC registers in an embedded
product. This is about exposing a dozen or so tunables that don't
control the SoC from the perspective of the OS running on it, but
controls how various features of the SoC are exposed to the *host*
system. Examples could be which of the SoC internal PCIe devices
exposed to the host is enabled (the SoC can appear as a GPU, a BMC misc
device or both or neither, it can have a DMA controller or not,
etc...). Other examples are scratch registers that need to be set to
system specific values by userspace, which the BIOS of the host will
read to determine some configuration information. That sort of thing.

There isn't that many, scalability isn't a problem. Both the list of
registers of interest and what needs to go in them is very much
system/vendor specific. This is a way for the kernel to act as a
"conduit" that doesn't need to know the specifics of a given
system/vendor/BIOS combination.

Your response smells like yet another case of trying to apply one of
those general "blanket" rules to something where it's completely
unapplicable.

GPIOs are binary values right ? These are arbitrary fields. We want
arbitrary fields. This is really needed Rob, otherwise we'll NEVER have
BMC support upstream. 

The other option will be a dozen random ad-hoc char-devs that would
have to be updated every time a new bit needs to be added or changed.
