The defconfigs shipped in the mainline kernel only serve the purpose of
building as many drivers/subsystems as possible and making sure they
work well together from a general distribution perspective like
Debian/Ubuntu/OE... That does not mean this is your configuration
template for a downstream kernel with only a specific set of SoCs to
support.

Right, you are also very likely to see code blow away that has been
enabled as part of the multi_v7_defconfig, but actually assumes that it
will only run on a a particular family of SoCs, of course, all of this
is good to fix to improve the multiplatform kernel, but does not
necessarily impact you directly.

FWIW, this is typically what we do for the brcmstb_defconfig, it is just
present in our downstream kernel, but we do use the multi_v7_defconfig
when testing upstream.
