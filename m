I don't really see a case where we would traverse a series of nodes
where the msi-map property wouldn't be in the first node. Could you
please give me an example?

A PCI device will only be configured to talk to a single MSI
controller, but here you stop parsing the msi-map on the first match,
and assume that you must have found the right MSI controller:

I think this should read:

+			if (masked_devid < rid_base ||
+			    masked_devid >= rid_base + rid_len ||
			    domain->of_node != of_find_node_by_phandle(phandle)) {
+				msi_map_len -= 4 * sizeof(__be32);
+				msi_map += 4;
+				continue;
+			}
+			matched = true;
+			break;
