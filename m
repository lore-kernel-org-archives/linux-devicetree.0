These compatibles could be optional. As it might not be required for 
devices which are simple and do not require any special interpretation 
of eeprom data.

Do we still need eeprom-cells if we are moving to use reg property here?

Yes, this looks good, and Sasha was also recommending something on these 
lines too. Also this addresses the use cases like serial number too.

Yes this sounds more sensible to let the consumer driver interpret the 
eeprom data than the eeprom framework itself.
