Add interrupt support to TSENS. The first 6 patches are general fixes and
cleanups to the driver before interrupt support is introduced.

This series has been developed against qcs404 and sdm845 and then tested on
msm8916. Testing on msm8998 and msm8974 would be appreciated since I don't
have hardware handy. Further, I plan to test on msm8996 and also submit to
kernelci.

I'm sending this out for more review to get help with testing.
