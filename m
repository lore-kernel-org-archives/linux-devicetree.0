When I've been fiding exactly that kind of bug in the PHY code, I've
been adding comments to the docbook function header detailing the
requirement to balance the reference.  IMHO, this is a good idea,
because the more places that get it with these APIs, the more likely
people are to potentially read it.

The comment I've been putting in the phy code is:

 * If successful, returns a pointer to the phy_device with the embedded
 * struct device refcount incremented by one, or NULL on failure. The
 * refcount must be dropped by calling phy_disconnect() or phy_detach().

which even goes as far as telling people how they should be dropping
the reference.  So there should be no excuse (ignorance is not an
excuse for this!)
