Because there are no DP0 or DPn registers defined for Masters in the 
SoundWire 1.x spec. DisCo is about specifying properties for standard 
registers, when they are not standard vendor extensions need to come 
into play.

Not necessarily. They define the allocation expected on that link and I 
see no problem specifying those values here. It's the moral equivalent 
of specifying which TDM slots and the bit depth of one slot you'd use 
for DSP_A/B.
And if you push back, then what would be your alternate proposal on 
where those values might be stored? This is a very specific usage of the 
link and it makes sense to me to have the information in firmware - 
exposed with properties - rather than hard-coded in a pretend bus 
allocation routine in the kernel. Either the allocation is fully dynamic 
and it's handled by the kernel or it's static and it's better to store 
it in firmware to deal with platform-to-platform variations.
