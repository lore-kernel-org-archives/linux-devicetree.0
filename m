Thanks Stephen for the review.

I beg to differ.

"Bindings for CPU nodes follow the ePAPR standard...."

ePAPR v1.1

3.6 CPUS node properties

"A cpus node is required for all device trees".

It is mentioned before cpus node and cpu node descriptions start.

I think you have a point though and it can be omitted, I certainly would
like to understand better what's "standard enough" in DT world to write
these bindings, I took ePAPR as a reference and tried to assume nothing.

I have not reinvented the wheel, just had a look at powerPC bindings and
tried to comply. If "Usage" is not proper we also have to patch a number
of in-kernel DT bindings and update the ePAPR.

Yes, I think I should add an explicit note.

Ok, I will reword it.

Mmm, I need to read more on dtc+cpp, I do not think that leaving it
as a string would hurt though, am I wrong ? Can we assume that all dts
are preprocessed before being compiled and passed to the kernel ?

I need to catch up on dtc+cpp before commenting further though, thanks
for the hint.

Yes, you have a point even though the bit-size implicitly plays a role
since we have to decouple 32-bit vs 64-bit boot methods.

Well, an OS-agnostic DT binding definition in the Linux kernel Documentation
directory. I would like to hear more on this to understand where these
bindings should be published, for now I have no choice but to point
people at Linux kernel documentation (and the ePAPR does too BTW, even
though it is not for explicit bindings).

Thank you !
