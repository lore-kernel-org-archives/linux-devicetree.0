I'm not suggesting a sycon node or binding usage here. There's an
"always on" hw block here that could be implemented as an MFD
driver that binds and creates a clk subdevice and whatever else
is sitting in here. Those subdevices could be informed of the
register base by knowing their parent driver is an MFD with a
certain driver data structure inside and then get at an __iomem
pointer through the parent's driver data. Or they could use a
regmap approach and rewrite a bunch of code. Or there could be
just a clk driver that binds to this node for now until a later
time that other features are needed.

I think we have regmap clk duplicated a couple times in the
drivers/clk/ directory now. Not sure how this is related, except
for that there looks to be a desire to use a syscon binding here
and that forces regmap on drivers?
