Me either.

It would require building ohci-platform into the kernel instead of 
making it a separate module.  That shouldn't matter much for 
embedded/SoC systems, though.  It seems like a good approach.

Exactly.

Thank you.

Space isn't a big consideration, because we're not likely to see a 
system with more a few controllers.  I say keep it simple.  If someone 
comes up with a controller using more than 3 clocks, we can change to 
dynamic allocation then.
