Instead of "depends on MULTIPLEXER", just add "select MULTIPLEXER"
to the Kconfig. Otherwise, you'll have to convince Linus that we
really do need a Kconfig question for the subsystem :-)

Yes, mux_control_get_optional should be easy to add.

Maybe no need for a compatible update either, if it works to do something
like this in the DT?

	usb_switch: usb-switch {
		compatible = "gpio-mux";
		mux-gpios = <&pm8916_gpios 4 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
			    <&pm8916_gpios XXX GPIO_ACTIVE_XXX>;
		idle-state = <2>;
		#mux-control-cells = <0>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&usb_sw_sel_pm>;
	};

But I obviously know little about how things are wired and really works,
so that might be totally off...

Otherwise, maybe a generic mux-pinctrl driver would do the trick?
(compare with drivers/i2c/muxes/i2c-mux-pinctrl.c)
