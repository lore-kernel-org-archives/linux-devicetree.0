The GIC case was supposed to be a hack for Exynos SoCs that do not have 
banked per-CPU registers. Currently I consider it broken, because it does 
not scale for multi cluster configurations. I believe you should consider 
the same.

IMHO the way to provide per-CPU properties should involve CPU nodes to 
make sure that the same CPU ID namespace is always used.
