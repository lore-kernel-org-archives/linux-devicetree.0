This phy is specifically for sata.

http://www.synopsys.com/dw/ipdir.php?ds=dwc_sata_phy
name can be: dwc_sata_phy
However, not find register from the website, not sure whether the 
register are totally same, or there is some change.
Other soc from hisilicon using the same ip can share this driver.

"hisilicon,peripheral-syscon" is privide power supply, etc.

Do you mean change the compatible to "hisilicon,dwc-sata-phy" or 
multiple compatible?
