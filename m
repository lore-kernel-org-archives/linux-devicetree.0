Users relying on finding the sec_mon node will obviously stop working.=0A=
I don't see any in-kernel users, however there could be others I am not=0A=
aware of and DT bindings should provide for backwards compatibility.=0A=
=0A=
I could deprecate "sec_mon" in the bindings and suggest "sec-mon"=0A=
instead, while leaving all existing dts files as-is.=0A=
The risk is breaking LS1012A users relying on "sec_mon".=0A=
=0A=
I see that ePAPR:=0A=
-allows both for hyphen and underline in case of node names=0A=
-allows only for hyphen (i.e. forbids underline) in case of alias nodes=0A=
=0A=
In the first case, I understand there's an (undocumented?) agreement to=0A=
prefer hyphen over underline.=0A=
For the 2nd one, does this mean I should change alias names?=0A=
=0A=
