I don't like this because it creates 2 different meanings for
dma-coherent. dma-coherent is meant to be a property of DMA masters
and that is not really what the L2 is. Perhaps "arm,io-coherent" or
"pl310-io-coherent" instead.

Arguably, the cache nodes would be the more correct location to
describe coherency if we described the DMA buses properly, but we
don't.

Why do you need a whole new struct. Can't you just null out the sync ptr?
