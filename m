    That file doesn't match the reality at all. It says:

<<
- compatible: must contain one of the following
         - "renesas,mmcif-r8a7740" for the MMCIF found in r8a7740 SoCs
         - "renesas,mmcif-r8a7790" for the MMCIF found in r8a7790 SoCs
         - "renesas,mmcif-r8a7791" for the MMCIF found in r8a7791 SoCs
         - "renesas,sh-mmcif" for the generic MMCIF
 >>

while in reality, the driver only matches on the latter string and doesn't 
care for the SoC specific strings.

WBR, Sergei
