Changes in v3:
* Dropped the "Correct GIC_PPI interrupt flags" patch from the series,
  as it was already accepted
* Disabled the i2c bus by default, to follow current convention (per
  Florian)

Changes in v2:
* Rafal discovered an issue with the GIC_PPI flags being incorrect.
  Since there was a dependency on that DT entry in this series, I added
  a patch to correct the issue and reworked the TWD patch with the
  changes.


These seemed to have been lost sometime last year.  See
https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/11/953

I am dropping the syscon reboot from the series, as I believe that was
the sticking point, and resending the TWD and i2c patches.
