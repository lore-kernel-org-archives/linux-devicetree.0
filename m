I'll have to go digging into what exactly perf_pmu_migrate_context
requires. Given the race, I'm not sure if that's going to work. It's
certainly not going to be self contained.

That also won't work for CPU PMUs, where it makes no sense to migrate
context or IRQs.  For those we appear to already be using have
IRQF_NOBALANCING, which sounds like exactly what we want.

That appears to influence irq_can_set_affinity(), which the procfs
helpers check.

Tai, can you try requesting the IRQ with the IRQF_NOBALANCING flag?

Thanks,
Mark.
