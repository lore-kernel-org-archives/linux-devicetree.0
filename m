Ugh, that should have been in:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/touchscreen/silead_gsl1680.txt

But somehow it is not (I believe it was there in earlier revisions of
the patch), I'll send a patch to fix this.

About it being suspicious, this is not really firmware it is a bunch
of configuration data / lookup tables for the controller which tell
it in which order the touchscreen horizontal / vertical sensor
lines are connected to its sense pins, and what values to send
for finger x% between line z and line z+1, which differs per
tablet model, since not all tablets use the same digitizer.

Regards,

Hans
