My stance is the same as last week: ACPI is the wrong tool for the job
at this time on ARM. The job in question is kernel and device runtime
configuration.

In the future, it might be more suitable, but likely not for at least
a couple of years, maybe more. Making strict statements about its use in
the future seems counterproductive at this time since there's no guarantee
that it'll reach that point in a given timeframe. Maybe it will for some
firmware vendors and platform vendors, while for others it won't, etc.

As my original email said, I don't think there's a reason to pick up
and pollute the whole kernel with double code paths at this time, while
the vendors using ACPI is still trying to figure out what to do and how
to do it. It's better to keep it out of the kernel, especially since it
will require either re-abstracting all drivers and subsystems, or adding
dual code paths to them for platform support that is likely to change.

Until then, if someone wants to boot with ACPI, then the best path would
be to translate as much of the simple data over to device tree and boot
with that as the in-kernel abstraction layer. That can be done at boot
or by crafting static device trees. Likely the first few generations of
hardware will not have elaborate complex AML-based ACPI workarounds for
stuff in the first place, so chances are this will not be a big issue.

If, down the road, ACPI seems to have their act together, have worked out
their kinks and reached a usable stable platform, then we can consider
bringing in the parts of it that doesn't make the kernel explode in
complexity and messiness. When this will be is impossible to predict
today, but I expect it to take a couple of years and some generations
of hardware.

Again, merging a substantial amount of ACPI enablement is premature for
the reasons already stated in the thread; it adds complexity and is likely
to churn several times as vendors figure out just how to work with it. The
two examples at hand (APM SATA and Exynos AHCI) both indicate that.

While vendors are free to implement it in their firmware, we are much
better off not relying on it right now. ACPI was messy on x86 in the
beginning too. Luckily we have an alternative that will get the work
done while the rest is being worked out.

So, if we're not going to merge the ACPI-enabling code yet,
mandating ACPI for booting isn't going to work if you expect to rely
on native-all-the-way-through-the-kernel ACPI implementation. It will
however work to some extent for the ACPI-to-DT approach, given that
the platforms are kept reasonably simplistic. And if it doesn't, we can
fall back to static DT and native implementation of whatever stuff ACPI
would have abstracted for us (clock drivers, reset drivers) if we really
have to.
