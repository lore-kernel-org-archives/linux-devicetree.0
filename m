(All those things are based on the assumption that mixer0, mixer1, tcon0
and tcon1 are all enabled in DT. If one group of mixer-tcon pair is 
fully
disabled in DT it will behave properly.)

For the backward search:

A) The current behaviour is to take the first engine found, which will 
be
wrong in the situation of tcon1 if mixer0 and mixer1 are both enabled:
mixer0 is taken for tcon1 instead of mixer1.

B) It takes mixer0 as it matches the first endpoint of tcon0's input.

C) It's a logic failure in the backward search, as it only considered
the DE1 situation, in which TCONs will only have one engine as input.

For the bind process:

A) The current behaviour is to try to bind all output endpoints of the
engine, during binding all outputs of mixer0, these will happen:
   1. tcon1 is bound with mixer0 as its engine if backward searching
   is not fixed.
   2. tcon1 fails to be bound as its engine is not yet bound when
   backward searching works properly, then sun4i_drv will refuse
   to continue as a component is not properly bound.
B) The binding process in sun4i_drv will bind a component that is not
really an working output of the forward component, but only exists in
the endpoint list as a theortically possible output (in fact not an
real output).
C) I tested with this patch's sun4i_drv_node_is_swappable_de2_mixer
function masked (always return false), and then the multiple
mixer+tcon situations don't work properly.

P.S. I think the BFS solution is really a dirty hack -- although we
bind components, not connections, we should decide the next component
to bind according to the connections -- not really connected
components shouldn't be bound.

For example, if we enabled mixer0, tcon0 and tcon1, tcon1 shouldn't
be bound at all. However in BFS situation tcon1 will also be bound
and then fail to be bound if the backward engine searching is fixed.
