Jens,

I want to specify that I tested those patches on Renesas RCAR H3 platform.
So my please update my Tested-by:

Tested-by: Volodymyr Babchuk <vlad.babchuk-Re5JQEeQqe8AvxtiuMwx3w@public.gmane.org> (RCAR H3)

As far as I know, Renesas plans to use OP-TEE as a driver for cryptographic
accelerators and others secure peripherals. So TEE support will be crucial
for theirs platform.

Also I suspect that every platform on ARMv8 will include ARM Trusted Firmwa=
re
(because it now provides PSCI) and some sort of TEE. So we really need
generic TEE interface in the kernel.
