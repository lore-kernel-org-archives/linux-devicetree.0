Well, my concern is the small, single chip platforms with limited ram and 
speeds measured in MHz.  My goal was that these platforms that had very basic 
gpio needs, no offboard gpio, just toggling a few pins for spi or whatever, 
could do that without pulling in a bunch of code they dont need.  I realize 
that for x86 or arm people with their giga Hz cpus with gigabytes of ram, its 
no big deal, but my little 60 MHz coldfire v2s with only 16 megs of ram (and 
even more constraining, 2 megs of flash) need all the help they can get.

I haven't been keeping up with the kernel list of late, can someone point me 
to what''s being discussed so I can see what were talking about here?
