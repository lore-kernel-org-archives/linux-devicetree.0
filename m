Without this option, it still does not boot.  Without device tree it
hangs after:

[snip]

NET: Registered protocol family 17
Loading compiled-in X.509 certificates
console [netcon0] enabled
netconsole: network logging started
davinci_emac davinci_emac.1: using random MAC addr: 5e:38:1a:1f:4f:77
mmc0: host does not support reading read-only switch, assuming write-enable
hctosys: unable to open rtc device (rtc0)
mmc0: new high speed SDHC card at address b368


With device tree it hangs after:

[snip]
mmc0: host does not support reading read-only switch, assuming write-enable
mmc0: new high speed SDHC card at address b368
mmcblk0: mmc0:b368 00000 3.75 GiB

Disabling the low-level debugging eliminated the garbage.

If/when you have more to me to test, feel free to e-mail me. I am
available today and tomorrow to test.
