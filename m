Ah, this is BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf still. I found the footnote you 
mentioned.

Ah. I've been thinking about the typical uses of barriers to ensure 
ordering of transactions on a standards-compliant ARM CPU.

It was pointed out on IRC that perhaps the barriers are to work around a 
CPU/SoC bug. In which case, if the CPU/bus really can swap results, then 
I can see how barriers might be required and how they might solve the 
problem. If this is the real reason, it sounds truly massively scary.

I think this deserves a complete description in each driver file and in 
the commit description for any commit that introduces these barriers. 
Otherwise someone else will just want to rip them out.

I'm also concerned that we need to add barriers in many more places than 
just that start/end of ISRs. For example, what if the ISR for the 
mailbox ends up calling back into some other driver that goes and 
touches a different HW module. Now we need to put barriers either at the 
start/end of that callback function, or immediately before/after we call 
that callback function. This has potential to need barriers in a whole 
bunch of places one wouldn't expect.

I sure hope this was fixed on bcm2836, or that the ordering issue 
appears separately within each CPU core and there's no interaction 
between multiple CPU cores. Otherwise, two separate pieces of code 
running on two separate CPU cores are going to have trouble when they 
start touching different peripherals.
