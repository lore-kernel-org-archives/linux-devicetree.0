Hi Arnd,

It's not as much a problem as a generic question : does a driver belong to
arch/* ?

Personaly it would have been far simpler for me to have it through the pxa tree,
but I want to be sure it's the right place. Others will follow, pxa mainstone is
such a candidate.

I was thinking so far that arch/arm/mach-* was for machine description,
ie. wirings, interconnections, initial setup etc ... The "driver" part, ie. code
really driving dynamics in IPs was as per my understanding in drivers/...

Now I can create arch/arm/mach-pxa/lubbock_cplds.c, that won't make any
difference to me, provided that it's the right thing to do.

Cheers.
