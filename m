Well - I wanted to get them in just in case we need them later.

If you have got access to documentation which states the correct
parent mux, then please share them so that we can implement them
correctly.

Also listing all allows us then to expose the values of the registers
via debugfs in case we need it - see separate RFC-patch 9 -  where
we expose the raw register values as well.

Correct - my issue (copy paste - I assume).

See comment above: please provide parent clock mux.
See also my comment about 3 clock that may be gates - this applies.

See comment above: please provide parent clock.

Well - there is the corresponding register at 0x7e101000 which reads as:
ctl = 0x0000636d
div = 0x0000636d

So we could remove this one if this is really the case of a dummy -
even though I wonder why there would be space in io-space reserved for
this "description" only.

maybe we allow setting debug in the PM at a later point in time?

As long as they are not referenced in the DT these only are read only
and can get read via debugfs - these are disabled anyway:

root@raspcm:/build/linux# head /sys/kernel/debug/clk/td*/clk_rate
==> /sys/kernel/debug/clk/td0/clk_rate <==
0

==> /sys/kernel/debug/clk/td1/clk_rate <==
0

I will change that.

Please propose how to continue to get the clocks in.

If you want some clocks left out, then that is fine and we
can accommodate that and just leave the defines in the bindings
header for later use...

Just list them.
