Yep, I will fix this, I think I picked this up variant while this was 
still being discussed. I will fix all such occurrences.

It is specific to Audio firmware build.
AFAIK, DSP port IDs are consistent across a given range of AVS firmware 
builds. So far I have seen them not change in any of the B family SoCs.
However on older A family SOCs these are very different numbers. Which 
is where ADSP version info would help select correct map.

This is just to protect the list from anyone deleting this.

Its very rare but the use case could be somelike the adsp is up and we 
are in the middle of finding a port and then adsp went down or crashed 
we would delete an entry in the list.

Yep, I will fix this.

This callback is invoked in interrupt context and sends are serialized 
at afe level.

Yep, It does not make sense to have a global state, I will fix this by 
making this state specific to port.

If I make this state specific to port, we could handle this case much 
cleanly.

Will do that.

Intention here is that we have plans to support different version of 
ADSP, on A family this command is different, so having this wrapper 
would help tackle this use-case.

Yes, I can probably free it here instead of depending on device core to 
do that.

Yes, I need to use _irqsave/restore variant here, Will fix that in next 
version,
