I don't think this has anything to do with the presence of a MMU or not.

If you don't have a way of signaling back to userspace when a vblank event
has occured then the driver needs to have additional code to reject ioctls
that depend on that functionality. So your patch is not wrong, it just needs
more code to be really useful.
