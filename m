...and there are lots of those sources! You should try getting out of
your imx219 shell some time, and have a look around! :)

Anyway, no the user is not allowed to configure a path that is not
allowed by the hardware, such as attempting to pass raw bayer through
an Image Converter path.

I guess you are simply commenting that for users of bayer sensors, the
other pipelines can be "confusing". But I trust you're not saying those
other pipelines should therefore not be present, which would be a
completely nutty argument.
