No, most of them don't.  Maybe a few cases do for historical reasons, 
but there are other hooks now to link probing and initialization code 
to.

The static mappings should be just that: static.  Most things should be 
dynamically mapped instead.  With the series I'm working on, everybody 
will get the benefit of a static mapping when one is available even if 
the dynamic mapping interface like ioremap() is used.  So having a bunch 
of static mappings is not bad, especially if they are easy.  But you 
should defer as much hardware probing as possible after the memory is 
initialized and the standard interfaces are available, keeping reliance 
on direct access to static mappings as small as possible.

Your best bet would probably consist of keeping the virtual address 
constant while the physical address is variable.  Adjusting the .pfn 
field in the v2m_io_desc table right before calling iotable_init() 
should be fine.  Alternatively you could have two such tables and select 
the right one at run time.  The io_p2v macro doesn't make any sense 
anymore in that context so it should be eliminated, and keeping only a 
minimum set of fixed virtual addresses for the peripherals that can't 
wait until ioremap is available should be fine.

Of course you should use the largest alignment for the same peripheral 
mapping.

That's what I'm suggesting: keep the virtual addresses constant, and 
adjust the static mapping's physical address accordingly.  But never 
should virtual addresses be part of DT as this is just an implementation 
detail.

And if static mappings are a problem, then try to live without them as 
much as possible.  Again there is no reason you should be doing too much 
hardware probing at .map_io time.
