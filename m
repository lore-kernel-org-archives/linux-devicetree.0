You can add request_line number and leave first two fields, cfghi and lo.

Yes it can be in dw_dma_chan :)

Okay, it was just a question from my side :)

You can still keep fargs as is and just fill them as:

       fargs.cfg_lo = 0;

if (DMA_TO_DEV)
       // dest is periph
       fargs.cfg_hi = be32_to_cpup(dma_spec->args+0) << 11;
else if (DEV_TO_DMA)
       // src is periph
       fargs.cfg_hi = be32_to_cpup(dma_spec->args+0) << 7;

The field size is 4 bits.

I don't have any sort of access for testing these :(
But, Vipul might try these at his end.
