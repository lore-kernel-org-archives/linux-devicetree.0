Then you should fix it so it works with DE2. For DE2 it would be something
like this:

Mixer probe
-----------
You have two choices on how to get its ID: a) Look downstream to TCONs,
and get the reg value from the remote endpoint, or b) get the display-engin=
e
node, and check the index of the phandle that points to itself (the mixer).
A is easier, and it is why I asked you to follow the connection ID rule in
the device tree binding.

TCON probe
----------
Similar to A) for the mixers, look upstream and get the reg value from the
remote endpoint.

Afterwards you would have correct IDs on both sides, then it's just a matte=
r
of going through the list of mixers and TCONs and pairing them up.


Mixer0  0 ---- 0  TCON0
        1      1 <- This would be the remote endpoint reg value for mixer1.
         \    /
          \  /
           \/
           /\
          /  \
         /    \
        0      0 <- This would be the remote endpoint reg value for mixer0.
Mixer1  1 ---- 1  TCON1

Hope this makes things clearer.

Actually that's not true. The TCON is bound to the backend. I don't see
any controls for muxing that. So the TCON-backend search routine is very
simple for DE1. The frontends are free to feed either backend though.

My code deals with muxes between the TCON and the downstream encoders (HDMI=
/TV).

You need something similar to deal with the mux between the mixers and TCON=
s.
My code doesn't fit DE2, because the case hadn't been added yet.

Maybe I missed something? TCONs and everything before them should always
be enabled. There's no reason not to. This is especially true for TCON0
which holds the mux register on some SoCs.

About Maxime's long term view: there's no reason we can't just silently
ignore a component if its supposed companion is missing, like a TCON
missing its backend, or the other way around. The current code already
covers the latter case: since the CRTC (and by extension, all DRM/KMS
functionality related to that pipeline) is created in the TCON bind
function, if the TCON is not enabled, the backend just idles.
