Hi David,

thanks, with the u-boot fix everything seems to work fine. I tested
da850-lcdk and da850-evm boards in DT and board file modes.

I'll be working with this series in the following days and will do
some thorough testing and rebase my aemif series on top of it. I'll
also use the recently merged reset support for board files to get rid
of the exported reset functions.

Thanks for your work!

Best regards,
Bartosz Golaszewski
