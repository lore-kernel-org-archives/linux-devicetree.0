The feature is already in the GPIO I2C mux driver.

True. Do any I2C I2C muxes not work like that though?

That'd be nice, bus a GPIO I2C mux isn't an addressable device on the
I2C bus; it has no I2C accessible registers or functionality. Since
there's no I2C address, I don't think we can make it a child of the I2C
bus without breaking existing semantics of the reg property for I2C
child nodes.
