Hello,

This patch set makes the use of the of PCI address translator less
restrictive. At the end it will allow to use the mvebu_get_soc_id
unconditionally.

The mvebu SoC (such as Kirkwood, Dove or Armada XP for instance) come
with an IP of a PCI controller. The ID and the revision of a SoC are
stored in the registers of this controller. Being able to get this
information allows to deals with errata more dynamically.

To manage to read this information, we need to map the registers, and
for this we need to use the of PCI translator which depend of the PCI
support.

However there are mvebu board without any PCI devices, and where
selecting the PCI support would be useless.

Moreover translating an address from a PCI node of the device-tree
into a CPU physical address doesn't require the core PCI
support. Those translations are just related to the device tree
itself.

The 1st patch introduces a new config symbol: OF_ADDRESS_PCI, which
will be selected as soon as PCI will be selected, so we remains in the
same situation the current code. It should go to the of tree.

The 2nd patch selects OF_ADDRESS_PCI as soon as ARCH_MVEBU will be
selected. This will make mvebu_get_soc_id available even without the
PCI support. It should go to the mvebu tree.

Thanks,
