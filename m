Timers are not initialized in the .timer init hook? The clock init is
definitely in init_early in some cases, but I don't think the actual
timer init can be.

Seems so, but my view is avoiding it altogether is the right way to me
just based on how few users there are of either within drivers/.

Anyway, this is all really besides the point for this series. If and
when the clock framework supports bootmem or memblock, then the DT clk
code can easily be adapted as part of that. It's just a matter of timing
and if you're not planning bootmem/memblock for 3.6 we can add this later.
