Unless it was very recently, it didn't solve my case.

Both, clk-fixed-rate as well as clk-vf610 are initialized using
CLK_OF_DECLARE. So I guess its the dt order. Or is it compile time
order? But I think driver code is linked before arch code.

Hm, this would then be a feature needed in the small boot loader I plan
to integrate with m4boot.

Ok, having a look at that. Do I see things right that this is somewhat
like a default "console=" argument? But probably not picked up by
user-space (systemd) later on...

Hm, actually all peripherals are accessible from both core. However,
since we do have different interrupt controllers, the interrupt property
looks different. But I guess it's perfectly ok to add this property in
the m4 and a5 specific dtsi.

We already discussed the shared dtsi issue for Vybird in a different
thread (VF500 support). Considering we want to create a shared dtsi for
both cores and all variants, I guess it would something look like that:

vfxxx.dtsi => vf500.dtsi (Cortex-A5, single core)
           => vf600m4.dtsi (Cortex-M4)
           => vf600.dtsi (Cortex-A5)
           => vf610.dtsi (Cortex-A5 with L2 Cache)

Or do we want the core included on all dtsi?

vfxxx.dtsi => vf500a5.dtsi (Cortex-A5, single core)
           => vf600m4.dtsi (Cortex-M4)
           => vf600a5.dtsi (Cortex-A5)
           => vf610a5.dtsi (Cortex-A5 with L2 Cache)
