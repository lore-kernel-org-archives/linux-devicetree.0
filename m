I will add the binding documentation in next version.

I have a question for this, do all nodes in dts file should be physical 
device?

The SSC part is a little different with other SoC family. So, I think, 
if I keep the ssc driver in driver/misc folder as the library code. And 
create new code into sound/soc/atmel for ssc which used for audio, would 
this be acceptable? If so, the framework will be the same with other SoC 
family.
