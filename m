Ranges property can set empty, but this means 1:1 translation. the I/O=20
port range is translated to MMIO address 0x00000001 00000000 to=20
0x00000001 00000004, it looks wrong else. I wonder if anyone get legacy=
=20
I/O port resource from dts.

=46or ipmi driver, I can get I/O port resource by DMI rather than dts.
