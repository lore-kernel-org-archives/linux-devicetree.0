Aargh, the web interface appears to have given me a duff URL. Let's try
again [3]. ;)

The comments note state-ids 0x01, 0x02, and 0x22, which don't appear to
match the DT. It might be that I've just misunderstood, but it could be
that every attempt to idle simply fails if we're passing the wrong
state-ids, and that's somewhat sub-optimal.

I'm not sure if there's a simple diagnostic for that. Lorenzo, any idea
if/how we can detect when the FW rejects an idle state it doesn't
recognise?

Yes. I know of several people just using the bootwrapper [4], with
custom DTs.

I was counting that under "FW or bootloader specific", so no.

Ideally, the Base stuff is meant to be all fixed, so we should be able
to support the default configuration.

To handle different FWs and bootloaders, I think we should have a DT
without the enable-method, PSCI node, and idle states, for the default
FVP Base configuration.

We can *also* have a DT for the default FVP Base + ATF configuration (so
long as clearly named as such), with the appropriate nodes and
properties.

Sure, cheers!

Thanks,
Mark.
