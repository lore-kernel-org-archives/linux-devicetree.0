I wonder if a "reset hog" can be board specific:
- GPIO hogs are definitely board specific (meson-gxbb-odroidc2.dts for
example uses it to take the USB hub out of reset)
- assigned-clock-parents (and the like) can also be board specific (I
made up a use-case since I don't know of any actual examples: board A
uses an external XTAL while board B uses some other internal
clock-source because it doesn't have an external XTAL)

however, can reset lines be board specific? or in other words: do we
need to describe them in device-tree?
we could extend struct reset_controller_dev (= reset controller
driver) if they are not board specific:
- either assert all reset lines by default except if they are listed
in a new field (may break backwards compatibility, requires testing of
all reset controller drivers)
- specify a list of reset lines and their desired state (or to keep it
easy: specify a list of reset lines that should be asserted)
(I must admit that this is basically your idea but the definition is
moved from device-tree to the reset controller driver)

any "chip" specific differences could be expressed by using a
different of_device_id

one the other hand: your "reset hog" solution looks fine to me if
reset lines can be board specific

I think you are right: if we could control the initial state then we
should be able to use level resets
