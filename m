Yeah, I'm working on EXYNOS5250 common clk stuff and Thomas is working on
EXYNOS5440. So I think, we can move on exynos4 and 5 both common clk at the
same time. Note, EXYNOS5 common clk stuff will be submitted in the beginning
of Jan.

I had a plan to remove non-DT support on EXYNOS4 for v3.10, but if possible,
I will try to do it for v3.9. If any updates, let you know.

Thanks.

Happy New Year!
