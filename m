This one definitely needs a patch description, since someone might not
know what a VC4 is, and "git log" won't show the text from the binding
doc itself. I'd suggest adding the initial paragraph of the binding doc
as the patch description, or more.

s/references to/phandles of/ would be more typical DT language.

Would it make sense to make all those nodes child node of the vc4
object. That way, there's no need to have these lists of objects; they
can be automatically built up as the DT is enumerated. I know that e.g.
the NVIDIA Tegra host1x binding works this way, and I think it may have
been inspired by other similar cases.

Of course, this is only appropriate if the HW modules really are
logically children of the VC4 HW module. Perhaps they aren't. If they
aren't though, I wonder what this "vc4" module actually represents in HW?

I'd add "in that order" right before ")".

Minor nit: Examples often don't include any nodes "above" the nodes
whose bindings are being documented.
