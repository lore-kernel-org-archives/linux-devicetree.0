The soc_device stuff (and arm32 cpuinfo has a h/w version). Today I
think users are pulling version info from h/w registers, but if you
don't have h/w registers, then getting it from DT would make sense.

If the bootloader injects it, then how do you know what to put into
the compatible string?

Certainly better to figure out if it is needed first.

Yes. I was willing to draw the line after the PMIC, but seems Olof is less so.

Not that I'm aware of. C is the only language you need. ;)
