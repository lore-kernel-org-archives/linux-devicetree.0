Some thoughts on this:

We decided that embedding machine instructions into the DT is a fairly
awful idea when discussing how to describe low-level debug UARTs in the
DT.  I don't think it's a lot better in this case (never mind issues
like ARM versus Thumb, endianness etc.)

If we are going to attempt to describe the call interface, we should
do it symbolically, allowing the hypervisor interface code in the kernel
to choose (or, if necessary, generate) the right call wrappers.

We will have this issue for descrbing power firmware interfaces for
example: we already know that this functionality might require an SMC
or HVC instruction to call it, depending on the platform.

A hypervisor with only one call ABI could leave this to be implicit,
providing there is a version number property of similar to allow future
changes to be accommodated.
