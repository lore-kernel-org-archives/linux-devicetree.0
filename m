Agreed.

Moreover, to me, the question really is "Does this driver need to be any
different depending on whether DT or ACPI is used by the platform and if
so, then why?".

In my opinion, there is no technical reason for such differences to be present
in this particular case.  The fact that the "used-by-rtas" property does not
make sense for the ACPI case doesn't imply that the driver should not be allowed
to check it then.
