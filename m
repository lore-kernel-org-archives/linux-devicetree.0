Yes, but that is x86 only and multiboot is it's nature quite 
architecture specific. The current(?) multiboot v2 spec has no official 
ARM support (only x86 and MIPS), so this would need to be "invented" 
first. While this is technically easy, ARM software currently has no 
support for multiboot at all: not in u-boot and not in Xen.
Multiboot support in Xen lives entirely in the x86 directory, and big 
parts of it are even in assembly.

I am about to write up a more elaborate technical rationale describing 
the problems with multiboot on ARM:

The idea is to use bootscripts (for instance in u-boot) to tackle this. 
See for an example below.

I don't see how the process would be differ significantly from the 
current process, where you have to load mostly two images, get hold of 
the DTB, enter image data into the DTB and launch the kernel. Now you 
just need to load an additional image and enter it's properties into the 
DTB, actually in a pretty generic way.

Parsing this is already done in Xen, for instance. In fact we just look 
for nodes matching "boot,module" and then check for other names to 
determine it's type (which is a few-liner patch in Xen which I will post 
later today). And I don't see a need to load modules that early that we 
don't have an un-flattened tree available.

Generating is also part of libfdt, in fact this whole subtree above has 
been generated on the command line of a stock Calxeda U-Boot:
dom0kernel=fdt addr ${fdt_addr}; fdt resize; fdt mknod /chosen module@0; 
fdt set /chosen/module@0 compatible "xen,linux-zimage" 
"xen,multiboot-module" "boot,module"; fdt set /chosen/module@0 reg 
<${dom0_addr_r} 0x${filesize}>; fdt set /chosen/module@0 bootargs 
"console=hvc0 earlyprintk ro root=/dev/sda1 nosmp"

With this you load the Dom0 kernel (via TFTP or ext2load) and do "run 
dom0kernel" and are done. I have also patches which add an u-boot 
command called "module" which automates this, but this is mostly 
syntactic sugar (though may be useful for future abstraction, for 
instance to support the x86 (or even ARM) "real" multiboot protocol).

Not necessarily needed, but useful, I think. As described above I don't 
see any technical obstacles of doing it in a more generic way, so we 
could as well go ahead with this. On x86 from time to time the need for 
additional binaries pops up (early microcode loading, for instance), so 
why not be be prepared.
Also this approach avoids hard-coding the Xen name into the bootloader, 
as said in the proposal the meaning could be derived from the order of 
the modules (as on x86), so a bootloader does not need to know anything 
about Xen at all.

Andre.
