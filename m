Am okay doing it, Only issue I have is the dsp state. If the dsp AVCS is 
not ready yet then we would be chatting on the service without the 
services being up on remote side?
Chances of this seems to be slim but we need to confirm this before we 
make a call on this.

Yes, I agree with you. will remove this in next version.
