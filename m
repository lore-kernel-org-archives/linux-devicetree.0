Presumably you can talk to your hardware colleagues and get them to make
you a FPGA with a DMA IP available?

You could either unconditionally register the PIO driver and only
actually start using it if the driver is instantiated or you could check
to see if the registration function works (handling deferred probe - if
the DMA driver just didn't load yet you should wait for it).
