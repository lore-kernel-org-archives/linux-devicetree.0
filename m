We've run into several cases where different boards uses the same
function but requires board specific electrical configuration.

So what we decided was to keep the pinmux in the soc-file (where e.g.
the uart definition is) and then extend it with the board specific
electrical properties (the pinconf), in the board files.

This does come with the complexity of having the pinctrl nodes split in
two places, but the responsibilities of the two parts is clear and we
remove the need for all board files to ensure the appropriate pinmux is
in place.


NB. We did discuss adding "sane defaults" for the pinconf in the soc
dtsi, but we end up spending considerable time debugging issues stemming
from not having the right pinconf; so better make this explicit and say
that the board has to specify it's config.

Bjorn
