If you believe that the bindings don't matter, then there is absolutely
no reason for them to exist in the first place.

If those binding matter to *anyone*, then those collating the bindings
have some responsibility of stewardship, and that includes
review/maintenance/etc.

Hence, the Linux community cares as stewards of those bindings, and
don't accept bindings they don't understand, for which there is no
obvious user, nor for which the authors claim stability does not matter.
Those go against the aims of DT, and against out responsiblities as
stewards.

I cannot put that any clearer.

This is not true for all but the most trivial of hardware, as I stated
previously.

Go and take a look at all the effort that went into sorting out generic
IOMMU bindings, when driver support was written after a large amount of
review to sort out fundamental concepts. We had to sort out fundamentals
before prototype driver code could be written, and while we knew drivers
were coming, an awful lot of review effort came first.

As above, if they were never used, and potentially wrong, why did they
exist?

Trying to upstream a binding with no user comees with no immediate
benefit, and potentially creates longer-term pain, whereas you can defer
upstreaming a binding until the driver is ready.

Note that I've repeatedly pointed out that the user of the binding
doesn't necessarily have to be linux. However, there does need to be
some demonstration, and commitment to maintaining the principles DT aims
towards (e.g. stability).

I understand that goal, and I've asked for a specific example, as this
is not clear-cut. e.g. there has been work on describing secure devices
for QEMU, but this isn't necessarily something we want to expose Linux
to in general.

Perhaps, or perhaps not. It depends on a number of details, and as I've
said previously I cannot give you a general answer, because there is
none. You must provide a specific case.

> You mention the case of another OS.
> What is the definition of OS in this case?

Generally, I am considering a general purpose OS (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD),
and not a secure-world trusted OS nor firmware (as typically these are
very strongly tied to the platform, and have very different strtuctures
and requirements when compared to a general purpose OS).

That's the conext in which bindings are developed.

There's been work on describing things about the secure world in DT for
QEMU. Firmware is typically so device-specific that an upstream/common
DT doesn't really make sense.

Perhaps you have an example of the specific use-case you care about?

No.

Bindings themselves should remain stable over time in that they must be
evolved so as to allow software to handle them in a stable fashion,
supporting old and new DTBs.

While a lot of that effort is taken by code, care must also be taken wit
the bindings themselves, and those considerations apply.

Thanks,
Mark.
