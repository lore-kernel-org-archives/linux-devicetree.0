Yes, I was thinking so as well.
Since my DeLorean is in the garage ;-) we have no other choice than
doing so.
My original suggestion for a generic name was based on my naive reading
of the existing code, which *looked like* it would be all compatible.
But as we know better now, this is the way to go.

Merci,
