The Cadence Sierra PHY supports a number of different protocols.  This
series adds a driver with support for USB3 and PCIe modes.

Only one clock frequency is currently supported, so the value of clock
provided in device tree is ignored.

Changes from v1:
* Each group of lanes is now treated as a subnode, and a generic PHY
  device is created for each group.
* General cleanup based on comments
* A reset is now required for each subnode.  The complete PHY block
  is taken out of reset at initial probe, and remains out of reset.
* Added a binding to allow for hardware configuration of PHY registers
