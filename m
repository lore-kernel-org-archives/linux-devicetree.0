Hi Mark, 

Thanks for applying the patches.

Am resending the leftover patches rebased on top of topic/qcom branch.
I have funtionally tested these patches on AP8016-SBC board and also
 compile tested them without CONFIG_OF on x86 to make sure nothing breaks.
All these patches are tested and Acked.

I Also included Arnd's Patch to fix Kconfig dependency on STORM board.

APQ8016 has 4 MI2S( Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary) which can be routed
to internal wcd codec or external codecs. This routing is controlled by 2 mux
registers.

Changes since v3
 - dropped OF dependency patch
 - dropped 6 patches which are already applied by Mark.
 - fixed Kconfig as suggested by Arnd.

Changes since v2(https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/16/236)
 - dropped 3 patches which are already applied by Mark.
 - rebased on top of topic/qcom branch.
 - changed dev_err to dev_warn spotted by Kenneth.
 - fixed typo spotted by kenneth.

Changes since v1(https://lwn.net/Articles/644266/)
 - Fixed Kconfig dependencies spotted by Kenneth
 - Fixed compilation error on ipq806x spotted by Kenneth
 - Fixed clk error messages spotted by Kenneth

Changes since RFC(https://lwn.net/Articles/642661/)
 - droped cleanup patches, as they are already applied by Mark.
 - prefixed shared functions with asoc_qcom_* as suggested by Kenneth
 - made LPASS driver depended on OF.
 - removed ipq806x specific bits from ipaif_reg.h
 - removed no_osr clk flag as suggested by Mark and Kenneth
 - fixed irq return values spotted by Kenneth
 - renamed the machine file to apq8016-sbc.c as suggested by Kenneth.
 - use dai->driver->id instead of dai->id as it breaks on Storm board.
