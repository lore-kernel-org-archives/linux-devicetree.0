[Resending -- apologies for any duplicates received.

Real reply below.

My lame excuse:

        It turns out that Mutt's decode-copy command (Esc-C) will lose
        most headers unless you invoke it from the message viewer *and*
        you have full header display enabled at the time.  Otherwise, or
        if invoked from the index, many headers may disappear including
        headers not filtered by normal header weeding, and everything
        needed for threading.  copy-message (C) always saves full headers
        though.  Maybe it's a bug.  Or not.  Go figure.
       
        This + my habit of saving messages I want to reply to in a
        separate mbox + mindlessly using decode-save instead of
        save-message even when I'm not going to run git am on the result
        = facepalm.]

The physical-sockets history of buses like PCI tends to force a simple
tree-like topology as a natural consequence.  You also end up with
closely linked topologies for power, clocks, interrupts etc., because
those all pass through the same sockets, so it's difficult to have a
different structure.

On SoC, those constraints have never existed and are not followed.  A
device's interface to the system is almost always split into multiple
connections, not covered by a single design or standard.  The problem
now is that increasing complexity means that the sometimes bizarre
topology features of SoCs are becoming less and less transparent for
software.

The device model currently seems to assume that certain things (power,
DMA and MMIO accessibility) follow the tree (which may not work for many
SoCs), and some other things (clocks, regulators, interrupts etc.) are
not incorporated at all -- making them independent, but it may make some
abstractions impossible today.

How much this matters for actual systems is hard to foresee yet.  Since
not _all_ possible insanities find their way into silicon.  The
onus should certainly be on us (i.e., the ARM/SoC community) to
demonstrate if the device model needs to change, and to find practical
ways to change it that minimise the resulting churn.

If we can come up with some generic bus type that is just a container for
a load of hooks that know how to deal with various aspects of each device's
interface to the system, on a per-device basis, than may be a start.

The platform bus kinda serves that role, but the trouble with that is that
it doesn't encourage any abstraction at all.  In the face of increasing
complexity, abstraction is desperately needed.

I think that the ARM community are the ones who care the most today,
so are likely to make the most noise about it.

The binding is entirely generic in concept, so we should certainly
push for it to be non-ARM-specific.  Non-ARM SoCs will likely need
to solve this problem too at some point.
