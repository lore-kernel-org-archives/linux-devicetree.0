Is the device actually going to mess up if someone sends it something
else or is it just going to ignore the extra bits (given that it's doing
autodetection anyway).

It's not just the fact that it's wrapping round to the next line, it's
also the fact that it's very weakly phrased for something which might
reasonably indicate an actual fire risk.  I'm pretty sure people will
not struggle excessively to find the reference to over current in the
datasheet.

If the silicon is flagging an over temperature condition that tends to
indicate a catastrophic physical failure in the system, it is likely
that the speaker itself has failed or there's otherwise a short in the
speaker output path and potentially other physical damage especially in
smaller systems where you might find that for example there's thermal
damage to the case (and possibly even the user).

If you're pushing DC through a speaker that will generally mean that you
will shortly see one or both of the over current and over temperature
errors, it's really not something they're designed for.
