Out hardware is connected to external equipment, electric meter via this 
UART.
This electricity meter can also be read externally by an optical reader.
Since this is a shared bus, we can't be sitting on that bus with our 
interface configured as UART as it prevents optical reader from talking 
to the meter. There are ways we can tell is optical meter is connected, 
if we detect that its connected we configure these pins as input else 
configure them for UART functionality.

Right now that is what I am doing in my code, requesting GPIOs in UART 
drivers and setting up the direction. I just wanted to make sure there 
wasn't way to setup pin direction using pinmux itself.
