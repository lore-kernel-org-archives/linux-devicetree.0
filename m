No, in the part you are replying to I am not referring to moving the
pins but reclaiming them. The pins are declared in the dtsi, as they
should. Eg. the LCDK dts reclaims serial2_rxtx_pins but doesn't reclaim
serial2_rtscts_pins while their declarations remain in the dtsi.

The purpose of this part was to clarify what I saw on the schematics
because your emails include the following 2 statements:

My email was to inform that it concerns the flow control pins of the
UART1 only and that the UART2 flow control pins are not concerned and, 
since they are dedicated to the UART2, should be reclaimed unlike
in the LCDK.
