What we said is that you should remove both the mfd cell
.of_compatible field and the OF table. Of course removing one but
leaving the other is not correct.

I see, you mean that you are not able to lookup the
"active-semi,vsel-high" property.

I think the problem is with your DT binding. You have a PMIC dev node
with compatible "active-semi,act8945a" that has a child node with
compatible "active-semi,act8945a-regulator" which in turn has the
"regulators" node.

I believe what Mark says is that there shouldn't be a compatible and
node for the regulators IC since is part of the PMIC. IOW, you can't
have it as a standalone node in the DTS.

I would just remove the "active-semi,act8945a-regulator" node and make
"active-semi,vsel-high" a property of the "active-semi,act8945a" node.
That way you can remove the mfd cell .of_compatible and OF table in
the regulator driver and read the "active-semi,vsel-high" using the
platform device's parent of_node.

But it's better if you wait for Mark's opinions before re-spining your patches.

Best regards,
Javier
