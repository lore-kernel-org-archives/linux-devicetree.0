"This code" refers to the driver's original condition, right?  I
agree that the driver has been suffering from incomplete clock
handling since it was born three years ago.  And that this issue
shall get addressed.  The question is just whether it needs to be
part of this series which has a different focus.

What the above patch addresses is prevention of an immediate and
fatal breakage, when common clock gets used but clocks aren't
prepared before getting enabled.  So I consider it appropriate as
a step in preparation before introducing support for common clock
on the platform.  (It's funny that I had a comment in this spirit
in the commit message, but trimmed it to not be overly verbose.)

What the patch does not address is to fix any other deficiencies
in the driver which might have been lurking there for ages.  This
would be the scope of a different patch or series, as addressing
it here as well would mix orthogonal issues within one series,
and would complicate review and test (and would delay or even
potentially kill the introduction of desirable support for common
infrastructure just because other legacy non-fatal issues aren't
addressed as well in bypassing).

I will look into what I can do to address your concerns about
proper general clock handling in this specific driver.  But I'm
unable to do this for all other drivers as well which I happen to
pass by as I work on platform code (partially due to lack of
knowledge).  In any case I won't be able to test all of these
changes in all subsystems (mostly due to lack of hardware and
test setups).

So I suggest to leave these general cleanup activities for a
separate series.  The current series certainly improves general
platform code, transparently brings new drivers into successful
operation, and keeps the quality of existing code (doesn't break
anything, does even actively prevent breakage).  So it shall be
acceptable despite its not being perfect (like addressing each
and every other aspect which may arise elsewhere).  Where would I
stop then?

Sorry for the lengthy reply, but I guess it's about just one
general aspect which equally applies to other parts of the
series, not just the specific SPI driver which the feedback was
provided for.  And I do appreciate your looking at the
submission.
