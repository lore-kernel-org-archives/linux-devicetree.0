"Any" is an exaggeration. See:

Even if my involvement with drm started with my driver last year, I took my personal time to report this issue, and to test multiple iterations of the fix. Then my "single patch in DRM" involved some work to get it right, and it is something, that made imx-ldb better by adding a feature it did not support before.

You made me curious. Can you point to the explicit cases where Peter "has not reviewed or replied to any patches, even on ones where he was explicitly cc'd"? And can you list case by case your take on why I should have done differently?

Also it is not clear to me what the problem really is here. I'm assuming is not me, but if I was qualified from your perspective then would be no problem, right?
