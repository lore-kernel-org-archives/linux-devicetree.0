You are right and sorry I may introduce confusion at here.

When I wrote this doc for binding, I assumed every debug logic has
its own clock source. This is because there have one register
ACPU_SC_PDBGUP_MBIST with eight bits, every bit is used to control
every CPU's DBGPWRDUP signal. I wrongly understood this bit is used
for debug logic clock gating.

I read CA53 TRM, the DBGPWRDUP signal actually is used between power
controller and CPU so can ensure CPU can be safely enter and exit low
power states; and "The EDPRSR.PU bit reflects the value of this
DBGPWRDUP signal". So I made mistake here and the bits in
ACPU_SC_PDBGUP_MBIST is no matter with debug logic clocks.

I will remove the "dbg_clk" from binding doc. Please correct me if my
understanding is still wrong or blur.

The clock HI6220_CS_DAPB is a mux; and after went through the spec for
register definition, the clock driver misses the dapb gate clock in
its system controller 'sysctrl'; And I checked this bit is luckily
enabled by bootloaders (I have not checked it's enabled by ARM-TF or
UEFI) so the driver can access debug module registers.
