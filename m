Hi Rob,

Thanks for the comments,

This is part of the Storage controller, illustration below

As name suggests ICE hardware is inline with the data lines of storage 
controller that is the reason why throughput is inline with storage 
speed. Having it out side of the controller kills the purpose of 
introducing ICE on storage controller. If this ICE hardware is placed 
outside then its similar to other crypto engines which are used for 
cryptographic operations. The main reason to keep ICE hardware inline 
with storage is to avoid extra latency (buffer copy) during read/writes 
which involves decryption/encryption.

Above comments valid here as well.
