I am happy to give my "signed-off" to this patch. I guess that Uwe's one 
was more an integration signed-off when he imported the code to his git 
tree.

Do not be sorry. Good work is always appreciated at any time!

> Changes from V1-RFC:
>   * drop patches on SSC since Bo Chen already did the work
>   * reorder patches to have the machine driver first
>   * drop code already handled by the ASoC framework
>   * drop unneeded SND_ATMEL_SOC_PDC config selection
>   * use static snd_soc_card and  snd_soc_dai_link structures.

Maybe we will have to split the series and let these DT patches go with 
arm-soc.
