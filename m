I'm not officially a DT maintainer, but let me share my thoughts on this.

So what options we have for this:

  1) include/dt-bindings - this directory is designed to contain headers
     that define the ABI between firmware and kernel code, in other
     words - DT bindings.

  2) arch/*/boot/dts - we already have files that can be included by
     other files in this directory, i.e. *.dtsi. Some are used to
     implement hierarchies of devices (e.g. s3c64xx.dtsi), but some are
     purely used as headers (s3c64xx-pinctrl.dtsi).

  3) include/dts? - I'm not sure if this have any benefits, but I'm
     listing it since it's one of the ideas that came to my mind.

Now 2) seems to be already used and doesn't seem to generate any 
problems, so I'm all for it. Still, there is one more issue. For files 
to be included merely by DTS files and so limited by DTS+CPP syntax, I 
don't think it's too good idea to call them *.h. Let's stay with *.dtsi, 
since that's the file extension supposed to be used for files that can 
be included from device tree sources.

Best regards,
Tomasz
