Hm, so on PPC the boot ROM is making use of the HW ECC controller, is
this correct?

I guess if this is a hard wired behavior of the boot ROM for the first
few pages, one could add such hard wired behavior for the affected page=
s
in the driver too. However, since other platforms don't use that, it
probably would need to be done in a device specific way (e.g. quirks
field which is set according to compatible...)

In the end, if somebody wants that feature, somebody will have to do
that change to the driver... But thanks for the information, will keep
that in mind.
