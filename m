OK. Has to be a device tree then.

Oh. My understanding was you meant the "probe" of the driver. The hwmon
will be exposing the functionality of reading the temperature sensor through
a sysfs interface. I am not sure as to whether a "poll" functionality is
provided by hwmon (probably not), but, when you cat or read the sysfs path 
you will have the temperature readout. The lm75.c is good place to start.
