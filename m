This is not just about being unmanaged, clocks can be shared, and another
driver can actively claim the clock and turn it off, we need to protect
against this too.

Basically the problem is that we must keep the clock enabled for the lifetime
of the simplefb device. We've been over this in 2 very long threads already,
and many alternatives have been evaluated and found wanting.

The only 100% safe way to ensure clocks are not turned off is to tie there
lifetime to that of the simplefb device, and the only reliable way to do
that is through a clocks property.

It really is that simple, and I don't understand why people keep insisting
there must be another way, while they fail to offer a (reliable, working)
other way.

"regulator-boot-on" tells the regulator framework to enable a regulator
at boot, but it does not protect it from getting turned of by another
driver later (it does not increase use_count).

So this is the same none solution as not turning off unmanaged clocks,
what if another driver who shares the clock, enables it during probe,
then disables it while done probing (to put things in low power state
until userspace uses the device).

This is not about not turning the clock off, this is about keeping
the clock on for the lifetime of the simplefb device, which is a different
problem, cause we must not remove a single calling point of clock_off,
put we must block all attempts to turn the clock off, which is done
by increasing its use-count, which is done by claiming + enabling it,
which needs a phandle to the clock ...

Regards,

Hans
