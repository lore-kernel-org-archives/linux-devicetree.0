Right.  I don't think it necessarily needs to be covered in this series, but it
sure does feel like the time has come.  The number of "if (dt) then x else if
(acpi) then y;" really stood out for me in this series.

Yeah, good point.  I was focused on ACPI and DT, and forgot about those.

Not sure if I have time, but I can start looking into this.
