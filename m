1. IIUC it was intentional not to include shmem as part of mailbox
   controller binding and was pushed to client drivers as it's generally
   not part of mailbox IP block. I am not sure if there are any other
   specific reasons for that, but I may be missing some facts.

2. I am not sure if we need nested driver/bindings (at-least to begin
   with). On a platform I don't think both/all modes will be used.
   I had  proposal for adding doorbell for ARM MHU based on extended
   bindings, but it was rejected[1]. But I really preferred that over
   the shim layer I had to add in v3.
