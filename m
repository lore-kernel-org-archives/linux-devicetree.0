This is an embedded system, you were expecting some kind of
standard? :-) I believe that SYS_PCICTL tells you whether
you're going to find the PCI controller or a decode error
at the addresses in the memory map where the PCI controller
usually lives, so robustness suggests it's worth retaining
the check in the kernel. [I'd want to check this on hardware
but my current belief is that if there's no backplane attached
then the register will read zero and the PCI controller register
space will abort with decode errors.]

The self-contradictory VersatilePB docs strike again, I see.
Interestingly, in the PB1176 docs this register is documented
as definitely read/only:

# [1]Read only: Reserved.
#
# Note
#
# On the RealView Platform Baseboard for ARM926EJ-S, this bit
# was PCICONTROLIN signal and indicated that 66MHz mode was
# enabled. The PB1176JZF-S only supports 33MHz operation.
#
# [0]Read only: Status of P_DETECT pin.

...and in passing provides some info about the 926 board that
isn't in the docs for the 926!

A little digging suggests that it may in fact be the case
that the 1176 docs are correct and the write to bit 0 does
nothing. However the safest thing here is to keep doing
what the old kernel did, I think.

thanks
