Ugh. Clicked reply without being done writing the reply!

Ok. Those are not really relevant to the PLIC. It has a flat interrupt
namespace and the way you handle all four kinds of interrupts in the
driver is uniform. I don't think we want to architecturally expose
this to the operating system.

HLIC = CSR only. PLIC = MMIO only.

Fair enough.

They are fixed at integration time and the PLIC driver does not need to care.

I'll talk to the other stakeholders.

The ordering requirement is that the first interrupts-extended entry
corresponds to the first context, second to second, etc. If a context
is unused for some reason, that's when you need a -1. The contexts are
linear and contiguous in the MMIO address map.

No. There is no 'physical CPU ID' anyway, except the mhartid CSR which
is unavailable to linux. The SBI conveys your CPU ID by passing it as
the first argument to the linux kernel.

The interrupts-extended in the PLIC uses a phandle to reference the
matching CPU in DTS. The num in cpu@<num> only need correspond to the
first register argument to the kernel.

If for some reason there end up too many -1 holes in the PLIC (b/c you
virtualized a 128-core machine down to say 2), you can always
virtualize the PLIC device and provide a matching simplified DTB.
