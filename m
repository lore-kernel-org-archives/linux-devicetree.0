For development boards, one would hope there is a way to sign your own firmware.
You can't expect - even for a phone SoC - that the development boards require
entering some kind of Faustian contract for development of low-level
software. What if
someone wants to develop a platform that doesn't require signing?

That said most of these dev boards have completely mangled JTAG anyway, and
I know Inforce (and Hardkernel, and so on) love their barely-ever-updated custom
firmware binaries, so..

The best thing would be to pick up one of those boards and port a PSCI firmware
to it (ATF or your own..) and just embarrass the SoC vendor by having better
mainline power management support (implemented by 10 lines in a device tree)
with the complicated code hidden away behind the scenes there, like it
should have
been done in the first place..

Ta.
