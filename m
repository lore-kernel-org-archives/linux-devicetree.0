I was merely suggesting something like:

	#define T(uV, _duty) { uV, (ST_PWM_REG_PERIOD / 100) * _duty }
	
	static const struct st_pwm_voltages b2105_duty_cycle_table[] = {
		T(1114000,  0),
		T(1095000, 10),
		T(1076000, 20),
		T(1056000, 30),
		T(1036000, 40),
		T( 996000, 50),
	};

But, meh, it's marginally more complicated and doesn't save much, so
I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not you'd want to change
it.

Sorry I was unclear.  I'm really asking about feasibility of multiple
instances of the same device (in this case the b2105).  The way the
driver is currently written, this wouldn't work because the instance
shared in the static b2105_info object.

As long as you've at least thought about this case, then I'm satisfied.

Thanks,
