It has been almost 6 months since the v5 submission, so here is a recap:

* There were a number of phy and usb dependencies that were submitted
  separately.
* The last of the usb dependencies has finally made its way into linux-next
  today.
* This series was recently included in "[PATCH/RFT v2 00/17] Add DT support for
  ohci-da8xx". I am breaking it back out again as a standalone series.


v6 changes:

* Combine "ARM: davinci: da8xx: Enable the usb20 "per" clk on phy_clk_enable"
  from the "[PATCH/RFT v2 00/17] Add DT support for ohci-da8xx" series with
  the "ARM: davinci: da8xx: add usb phy clocks" patch in this series.
* Change the syscon and da8xx-usb-phy device ids to -1.

v5 changes: renamed "usbphy" to "usb_phy" or "usb-phy" as appropriate

v4 changes: fix strict checkpatch complaint

v3 changes:

* Fixed the davinci device tree declarations to use the preferred DT address
  convention so that the items I have added can be correct too.
* Moved that davinci clock init so that we don't have to call ioremap in the
  clock mux functions.
* Added a new "syscon" device for the CFGCHIP registers. This is used by the
  USB PHY driver and will be used in the future in common clock framework
  drivers.
* USB clocks are moved to a common file instead of having duplicated code.
* PHY driver uses syscon for CFGCHIP registers instead of using them directly.
