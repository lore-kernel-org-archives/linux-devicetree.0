That should be upto client... As a dmaengine driver you should enable
data transfer from src to dstn.

Why should a controller be hidden from user, I dont see why that would
be a good thing

It is not about changes, it is about the SW model you want to have.

The intermediate SRAM transfers should not be made within DMAengine
driver, client can chose to have two transfers and couple or not, it is
upto them to choose. Sorry I do not like this abstraction and would like
to see a cleaner approach
