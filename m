That's somewhat better, though your addressing is wrong.

Yes, but the only useful information here is really "0xe0". I imagine
you also want "amlogic,meson-gx-socinfo" to instantiate a driver, but
that's not a reason to put a node into DT. You can just easily have
whatever handles "amlogic,meson-gx-ao-secure" provide the version
information out of register 0xe0.
