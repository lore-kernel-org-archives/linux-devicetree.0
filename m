Yes, that would be good.

Do you have a dependency on patch 10 (the one for EFM32) in your later
patches?

If not, you can send the other ones to Shawn, so I pull them as
a branch, and then I apply that on top of the merges. I have also
merged two other ARMv7M platforms for 4.2 now (both in next/soc),
so we should do the same change for those as well, and I'd rather
apply a patch for that, than merge a branch that is based on
next/soc.
