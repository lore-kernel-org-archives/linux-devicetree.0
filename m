Right, there should have been a comma before 'yet'. Sorry for the confusion.

Okay, I'll prototype it.

(There's MFD/syscon, but having used it previously I'm still grappling with the benefit over some of the weirdness it injects into devicetree - maybe I did it wrong.) Or alternatively, a generic driver that's choc full of platform-specific data covering the platforms that require it?

Right, the features we want to expose are part of the SoC, not the board it sits on. The distinction was that different boards (or even different software payloads on the same board) could use them in vastly different ways, though that mainly affects how they're treated inside the kernel and at the kernel/userspace interface rather than at the devicetree level.

Cheers,
