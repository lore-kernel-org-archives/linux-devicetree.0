Yes I agree, no argument there.

We will have to support them. But I don't want that to be defacto
standard. They should be treated as deviations. Though specification
says the behavior is IMPDEF, it does provide standard interface(EDPRCR)
to use and we should have that in the driver IMO.

Yes I know but that's either issue with the firmware or the debugger
and we can work them around in user-space too instead of baking the
solution to kernel.

FYI, I added support in ETMv4 to emulate power-down during active trace
session and so far I have not seen any report on things breaking because
of that register access(may be no one has tested it on other platforms
yet :()

Cool, thanks. Lets try out that and see if it helps first before bluntly
advertising CPUIdle disabling and that too in misleading ways like "nohlt"

Again not arguing on that. Just saying we can try out if that solves the
issue. As I said there are other ways to disable idle and we can
advertise those instead of such misuse. Also those alternative methods
are runtime and can be used when you need them.

Absolutely, so just mandating might just solve issue *accidentally*
not *intentionally*. So I don't want it to be advertised in that way
and that becomes defacto.

True.

Point taken. So we could just specify that all necessary power domains
need to be on for proper functionality for this feature and that it's
highly platform specific instead of mixing cpu/cluster idle details here.

Exactly and the help text could be something on the similar lines as you
mention/summarize above.
