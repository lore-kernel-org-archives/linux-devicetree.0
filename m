I guess we could turn the question backward. Why do we need a static
allocation? This isn't a buffer that is always allocated on the same
area, but rather that we have a range available. So our constraint is
on the range, nothing else.

I'm not sure to get what you're saying. You have the property
linux,cma-default in your reserved region, so the behaviour you
described is what you explicitly asked for.

The SRAM driver is available on the A20, so you should really use that
instead of a syscon.
