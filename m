Indeed. I don't have a full understanding of that part to be honest, nor 
why we need something SoundWire-specific. We already abused the 
set_tdm_slot API to store an HDaudio stream, now we have a rather 
confusing stream information for SoundWire and I have about 3 other 
'stream' contexts in SOF... I am still doing basic cleanups but this has 
been on my radar for a while.
