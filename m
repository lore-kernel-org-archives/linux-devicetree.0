So one other solution which comes to mind here is to move the
snd_soc_card_jack_new() call into the codec driver's
rt5651_apply_properties() function (conditional on a jack src being
set in the properties).

This would make the machine driver code look like this:

	props[cnt++] =3D PROPERTY_ENTRY_...
	props[cnt++] =3D PROPERTY_ENTRY_...
	props[cnt++] =3D PROPERTY_ENTRY_...
	props[cnt++] =3D PROPERTY_ENTRY_...

	ret =3D device_add_properties(codec->dev, props);
	if (ret)
		return ret;

	ret =3D rt5651_apply_properties(codec);
	if (ret)
		return ret;

Which makes the ordering really clear without needing any
comments.

This will also make the jack-detect device-properties work with
devicetree platforms without any changes to their platform code,
which currently is not the case since the non Intel platform-code
does not call snd_soc_component_set_jack().

Thinking more about this I believe that doing the
snd_soc_card_jack_new() call inside the codec driver based on
device-properties is a better solution then doing it in the
machine driver.

Please let me know if you agree then I will rework the remaining
patches accordingly.

Regards,

Hans
