well you can update virt-dma to queue up multiple descriptors to HW is thats
supported :)

Lots do 0 as they dont allocate descriptor here, they allocate when the
.prep_xxx call gets invoked, which is what I suspect from you case too.

Thats is true too, but do we want to limit this in driver ? This is more of a SW
limitation of who breaks up. for some like audio it makese sense but other not
