Sure and sorry for that.

I was not aware of that. Thanks for clarifying the differences.

OK, that depends on how we consider it. As you said yes it just goes to
single target processor, but hardware designers consider it still 32
channels are they can be controller independently without any locking.

Sure, that's the reason I have this abstraction now.
