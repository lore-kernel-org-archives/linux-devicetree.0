The developers working on it have said that they definitely want to
be compatible with the existing bindings, so the answer to your question
is yes.

I would like to see the documentation recommend one over the other for
new bindings. Most other subsystems use the plural form even for
properties that only have one entry, so I'd like to see "foo-gpios"
become the canonical form for named gpio lines. Drivers that use
existing bindings with the "foo-gpio" form (or worse, "foo-somethingelse"
can use the same internal interface as the drivers that use name plus
index. Do you see a problem using what I suggested for the combined
API:

__gpiod_get(dev, propname, index); // use property name plus index
gpiod_get(dev, index); // use "gpios" plus index
gpiod_get_named(dev, "name"); use "name-gpios" with index 0

plus all fwprop/devm/flags/of/... variations of that
