If we're not worried about the non-linearity of the 150R+120R+100R and
182R+150R+100R fan controllers (vs the 150R/100R/33R ones), these fan
speed blocks could be collapsed into common.dtsi.

The Ricoh RTC seems to be only used in the pre-2010 units.  Everything
else uses the Seiko RTC.

Most of the 1-bay and 2-bay units use the GPIOs that are multiplexed
with the built-in SATA interface activity/presence pins on mpp 20-23,
while the 4-bay units use ge01 and a PCIe SATA controller, and put the
software controlled HDD leds on mpp 36-43.

Most of the 6281 units with HDD power controls use mpp 29 and 31, while
most of the 6282 units with HDD power controls use mpp 30, 34, 44 and 45
and provide a model ID on mpp 28, 29, 46 and 47.  Pre-2012 units and
4-bay units didn't have a separate power control for HDD1.  These power
controls are presumably to limit startup current from the 12V brick
power supply.

From
http://forum.synology.com/wiki/index.php/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have,
it doesn't look like there are any new 6281 or 6282 models for 2014.
