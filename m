Hi Lorenzo,

This looks good, but I have a couple comments.

Under some situations (where mpidr_el1[63:32] == 0), #address-cells =
<1> needs to be supported for 64-bit hardware, to maintain compatibility
with kvmtool. Will had a commit specifically to allow this (72aea393a2:
"arm64: smp: honour #address-size when parsing CPU reg property"), which
mentions the kvmtool compatibility issue.

I think we need to state that it _should_ be 2. If all the identifiying
bits in the upper half of the register (currently Aff3) are zero, then 1
cell is permitted, and the cell refers to mpidr_el1[31:0].

It's possible that bits which are currently RES0 may become identifying
bits in future, so for the moment we could state that we only allow one
cell when all of mpidr_el1[63:32] is zero, and if mpidr_el1[40:42,23:0]
becomes insufficient to uniquely identify a CPU we need to update the
binding document.

These all look fine to me.

This probably needs to be reworded to cover the #address-cells = <1>
case mentioned above.

Later, we should probably split these into individual bindings docs to
better describe platform requirements. We don't need to do that now.

Otherwise this looks good. Thanks for all the hard work putting this
together, sorry for the last-minute change request.

With the #address-cells = <1> fixups:
