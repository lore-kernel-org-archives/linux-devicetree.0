I don't see anything mentioning it.  If I remove the parenting calls
then the es8328 will refuse to run as its clock is at 66 MHz rather than
the requested 22.5792 MHz.  But since you say the default clock tree
support is going to be merged, I'd like to try using that code.  Is this
the "assigned-clock-parents" patch you're referring to, or is there a
patchset that will automatically reparent as necessary?

I'm having trouble understanding where the separating line is between
machine drivers and codec drivers.  A random sampling of codec drivers
doesn't yield any drivers grabbing their own power switches.  Is that an
oversight?  Should every codec driver include at least one regulator to
describe its power source?

If you like, I can move the regulator from the machine driver to the
codec driver, and make it non-optional.  But we've done designs in the
past where it just hangs off the 3.3V rail where it's non-switchable,
and the concept of describing a regulator seemed overkill.
