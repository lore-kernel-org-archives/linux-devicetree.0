Sorry what's the pclk part? Using a fixed factor is OK, as long
as we don't have to call clk_get_rate() in this driver it's a
better design.

Ok. I was hoping that this wasn't providing any clks required in
the timer driver. Even if that's true, we could just register the
part of the clk tree that needs to be ready for the timer from
CLK_OF_DECLARE() and then register the other clks from a regular
platform driver. Some people have already started doing this, so
there are some examples around (clk/nxp/clk-lpc18xx-creg.c is one
example).

In that case I don't have a problem with a toplevel MFD node in
DT with a child node for the clk part and a child node for other
logical driver parts. Or it could all be one MFD driver and node
that knows to add a clk device as a child of the MFD purely in
software so that we can fork control of the clk part over to the
drivers/clk directory. If you have the clk driver attach to some
child device then you can always get the regmap from the parent
MFD via the dev->parent pointer.

Maybe Rob can chime in here too with the proper design, because
I've seen both styles.
