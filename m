The platform name is fine, we don't care too much about that as it is
easily changed
if necessary.

We should really avoid having the 'xx' placeholder in there but instead put
actual chip names in the compatible string, preferably the real ID such as
"cn8890" for the older chip. I see that we got it wrong for thunder-88xx.dts,
but that is no reason to duplicate the mistake.
