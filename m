Well, the label is just for the parser and it does not get into the DTB.
This is where the DTS author can make things up just for their own
convenience (like main_codec, aux_codec or even cs42l52). 

I know this is really more bikeshedding than anything useful, but I'd
rather try to follow the written rules in ePAPR, instead of nothing at
all. At least just to make things more consistent.
