You guys were so right ;)

I just tested your v4 of the watchdog patches and forced a stale
watchdog irq. It will cause a watchdog reset as you predicted.

I have some fixes for irq-orion.c's bridge irq that take care of:
- handle_edge_irq
- mask _and_ clear irqs on init
- use irq_enable to ensure stale irqs are acked before unmask

With the last one, the stale watchdog irq will not raise watchdog's
irq handler anymore.

BTW, during my test, it looks like RSTOUT wasn't set, so I'll add
my Tested-by on v4 when I have investigated that.

Sebastian
