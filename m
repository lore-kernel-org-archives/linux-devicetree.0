Hi All,

This patchset adds apq8016 audio support into lpass driver. Existing Lpass
driver can not be used as-it-is for apq8016 as it contains code specific to
ipq806x. Also the driver only supports single i2s port, single dma channel and
single bitclk control.

APQ8016 has 4 MI2S( Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary) which can be routed
to internal wcd codec or external codecs. This routing is controlled by 2 mux
registers.

This patch series firstly re-organizes the lpass driver such that the SOC
specific bits are moved away from the driver. And secondly the SOC specifics
are now passed as lpass variant data which would include various register
offsets, dma channel allocations and SOC specific clock handling.

Finally the patchset add apq8016 lpass and machine driver.

This patchset also has two trivial cleanup patches which are to do with
redundant checks and removing unnecessary header files.

All these patches are tested for HDMI audio via adv7533 bridge and Analog audio
on APQ8016-SBC and msm8916-mtp boards. I dont have access to ipq806x boards to
test these patches.

This is very first version of the patches which was developed with very
mimimal/no access to IP documentation. I would like to get your opinon on the
over all approch.


Kenneth/Patrick,
	Could you please try these patches on storm board?

Thanks,
srini
