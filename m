Sorry for confused expression, I meant it was not a right way to utilize idle mechanism
and shouldn't be upstreamed.

Right, actually deep_sleep was for 'suspend' (forces idleness upon the OS until a wake-up event
resumes the OS from suspend), for example when users press power key on mobile phone to turn off
the screen. So the author implemented 'suspend' using cpu_psci_ops::cpu_suspend I figure that this
way is not correct, I will remove this state from DT.

I would appreciate any suggestion for how to implement this kind of function properly.

Thanks,
Chunyan
