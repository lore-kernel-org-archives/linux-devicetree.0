I agree with you. The driver is irrelevant in this context. What matters is =

which properties are applicable to the bus. For instance, if the VIN parall=
el =

input supports configurable polarities for the h/v sync signals, hsync-acti=
ve =

and vsync-active should be listed in the bindings. On the other hand, if th=
e =

polarities are fixed, then the properties are not needed.

That would be nice too :-)

I think you're right, I don't think that's the case.

We should not remove properties from the dts files when they correctly =

describe the hardware and have an added-value. On the other hand, if a =

property correctly describes the hardware, but is constrained to a single =

value due to hardware limitations, then we can omit it.
