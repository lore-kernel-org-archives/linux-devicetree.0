The struct tee_device holds a shared memory pool from which shared
memory objects are allocated. These shared memory objects can be mapped
both by user space and secure world. When a shared memory object is
freed secure world may need to be notified, OP-TEE doesn't need that but
other TEEs may need it. To come around the problem with what should
happen when the driver is removed I'm increasing the refcount on the
driver for each allocated shared memory object and created file
pointers. As long as any resource is in use by either user space or
secure world the driver can't be unloaded.

What should happen when user space or secure world has some shared
memory which the driver owns (either allocated from CMA or from some
memory range received from the TEE)? Killing the user space process
would be a bit unfriendly. Secure world may not be prepared to release
that memory right now either.

What if I:
* Keep all the reference counting I have today on the module
  to make sure that the module can't be unloaded until all shared memory
  resources are release
* Change to use the pattern (with a struct device etc) as described above.
  I can't protect the ops with just a mutex since tee_ioctl_cmd() needs to
  be multithreaded. I need some reference counting too,
  try_module_get()/module_put() does exactly what I need here.

Is that pattern OK?

Jens
