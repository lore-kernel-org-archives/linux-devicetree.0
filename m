My initial goal with this patchset was to allow a dai_link to have no
no platform component, instead of having dummy by default.

However, when rebasing, I discovered that Kuninori Morimoto had recently
done that in a different way :)

I am still submitting my change since it should allow multiple platform
components on a dai_link, which is one of the FIXME note in soc-core.

I have also added a check on the codecs component availability to align
on what was done for platforms and cpus

Change since v1 [0]:
* Fix registartion typo
* Rename dlc variable to codec/platform

  ASoC: soc-core: defer card registration if codec component is missing
  ASoC: soc-core: support dai_link with platforms_num != 1
