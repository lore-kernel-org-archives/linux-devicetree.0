Oh, you were referring to the type used. Agree, since we are moving
away (read below) from the DTS, probably using fwspecs is just on
overkill.
The only thing I'm not really fond of is to use a bitmap since I'm not
really sure that the interrupt space is a contiguous range for all the
Amlogic / Meson SoCs. Probably the most sensible way is using
something like TI did for 'ti,irqs-reserved' that is an array of IRQs.

Ok, I see you point

I hope things will be a bit clearer in v3.
