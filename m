It would be nice if we could use this platform device for doing
the DMAish memory allocations that we do in this driver too. I
guess one complication there is that we would need to allocate
memory with the DMA APIs before CPUs are brought up
(early_initcall level).

This include is here twice.

Maybe we just shouldn't allow this? The firmware isn't going
anywhere at runtime, and this driver is currently marked as
bool in the Kconfig.

Maybe 'qcom_scm' ?

Isn't there some sort of builtin_platform_driver() macro for
builtin modules?
