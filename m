Yes, they should all be drivers.

Assuming clocksources, clockevents, or primary interrupt controllers are
special, and thus forcing everyone to use OF_DECLARE for the whole
subsystem, doesn't fly everywhere.

Clockevents and interrupt controllers can have a module clock.
All three can be part of a PM Domain, which requires a struct device to
be handled properly.

You may want to split it because of dependencies. OF_DECLARE
doesn't handle EPROBE_DEFER, while some critical parts may be
needed early.

Especially if there are clock loops, but that's something different.
Cfr. cs2000 in arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/salvator-common.dtsi, which
provides a clock from the main SoC, but also consumes a clock from the main
SoC. The latter is modeled in DT as a fixed-clock as a workaround.

There is a need for using the driver model for the GIC. On some platforms,
the GIC can be part of a clock and/or power domain.

For secondary GICs, that got fixed in commit 9c8edddfc9924cb4
("irqchip/gic: Add platform driver for non-root GICs that require RPM").
For primary GICs, it's still not fixed, so we have to live with
CLK_IS_CRITICAL, and rely on other critical devices in the same power
domain to avoid the power domain being powered off.

The fixed probe order imposed by OF_DECLARE() limits this: if your
OF_DECLARE() driver depends on something else, the latter must become an
early device.
If all subsystems would use real devices, EPROBE_DEFER would handle most of
it automatically.

Then, next step would be to avoid triggering EPROBE_DEFER, e.g. by
analyzing dependencies in DT...
