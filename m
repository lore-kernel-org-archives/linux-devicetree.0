This is outside of my area of expertise, but comparing this to
bindings, TRM, and other platforms it looks reasonable to me.

I'm curious: why did you choose "dmac1" for the alias here?  I would
have called it "dmac_peri", "pdma", or something similar as per the
address map in the TRM.  I found a single reference in the TRM to
"dmac2" but it wasn't immediately clear to me which DMA that was
referring to.  In a commit in a temporary tree I see that someone at
Rockchip called the DMA at ff250000 "pdma1".

nit: when we have easy addresses to compare to, we should probably
sort by address?
