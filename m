The driver does not do this today. It probe the HW once during early
boot, then aborts driver probes. It provides no provision for dynamic
assignment.

Is this something you plan to implement? How will the secure world
notify the non-secure world of its intent to manage a device, or
vice-versa?

I don't follow. Robin and I suggest that gets encoded in the DT, which
is *more* efficient than having each driver probe the DT, begin probing,
then abort via the notifier.

This really seems like something that should be done *prior* to entering
Linux.

Thanks,
Mark.
