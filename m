I never managed to figure out how to get that to work (at least on my
apq8074 dragonboard.. fortunately ifc6540 seems to work w/ appended
dtb).. kind of a pita because it is a bit of a non-standard boot.img
format too..

Otoh getting an upstream (or even different kernel) kernel working can
be hard enough as-is on random different tablet/phone/etc.  Why not
make whoever tries' life a bit easier by allowing some nonsense node
into the qcom dtbs which makes it compatible w/ bootloaders already
out there in the field ;-)
