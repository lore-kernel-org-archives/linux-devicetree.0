true, the scope of my experience is consumer grade NASs, routers and
APs.  At the very least, it's much easier than upgrading the bootloader.

Also, my pov is as a hobbyist modifying devices post-sale.  The idea is
something I could add to my existing boxes without having to upgrade the
bootloaders.

In systems missing this capability, they often have the ability to
update the kernel.  All that's needed is one block of flash.  Current
random-seed size is 512 bytes.  I'm not saying it's easy or desirable.
But for folks who feel it's necessary to have kaslr on embedded devices,
it would facilitate better random numbers.  "Better" meaning much harder
for an attacker to guess.

Of course, I wasn't arguing for one or the other.  As you said later, in
situations where you can't feed in a seed file, MAC addresses and serial
numbers are better than nothing.

thx,

Jason.
