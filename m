So the plan is, If the modem service can be queried using AVCS core 
commands then it would be added dynamically from q6core driver else we 
can add is as static service into this list.

No. svc id is unique per client id, so it redundant check as you said.

We would need one more entry for modem case, like db410c cases, Will add 
this as we move on.

This will work too!

Current design I had in mind was to get the q6core service up and this 
can query what AVCS static services are available on remote side and 
then add apr devices.

If we go with dt approch we might not need q6core driver, but on the 
other hand we need to be aware of svc major and minor version, which 
might be specific to the dsp firmware running on. Also we might endup 
talking on services without querying the dsp state.

May be we should do some offline disussion on this!

In some cases like q6asm the apr header port numbers are much more
