Maybe we can find a way to fit this into the existing drivers/leds/ subsystem?

That already supports blinking, brightness and colour attributes of LEDs,
so could this be extended to support (one of) digit, number, character
or string with a common sysfs attribute and a way to hook up a led driver
to that?
