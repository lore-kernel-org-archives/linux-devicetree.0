There is a 'mod' suffix, but it is used for the bus gates only, not for
the main clocks.

> And we have to remain consistent anyway.

I don't see any consistency in the H3 DT:
- the bus gates are named "ahb" and apb"
- the (main) clocks are named "mmc", "usb0_phy" and "ir"
There is no "bus" nor "mod".

Not at all. The video chain is simply
	CRTC (TCON) -> connector (HDMI/LCD/DAC/..)
The DE is an ancillary device which handles the planes.

Complexification:
1- my solution:
  At startup time, the DE device is the DRM device. It has to know the
  devices entering in the video chains.
  The CRTCs (LCD/TCON) are found by
	ports[i] -> parent
  The connectors are found by
	ports[i] -> endpoint -> remote_endpoint -> parent
2- with ports pointing to the LCDs:
  The CRTCs (LCD/TCON) are simply
	ports[i]
  The connectors are found by
	loop on all ports of ports[i]
		ports[i][j] -> endpoint -> remote_endpoint -> parent
3- with a phandle to the DE in the LCDs:
  The DE cannot be the DRM device because there is no information about
  the video devices in the DT. Then, the DRM devices are the LCDs.
  These LCDs must give their indices to the DE. So, the DE must implement
  some callback function to accept a LCD definition, and there must be
  a list of DEs in the driver to make the association DE <-> LCD[i]
  Some more problem may be raised if a user wants to have the same frame
  buffer on the 2 LCDs of a DE.

Anyway, my solution is already used in the IMX Soc.
See 'display-subsystem' in arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6q.dtsi for an example.

The CRTC is a software entity. The frame buffer is a hardware entity.

The DE and the LCDs are different devices on different drivers.
A DE must be only one device because it has to handle concurent
accesses from its 2 LCDs. Then 2 drivers.

But only one module. Why? Because there cannot be double direction
calls from one module to an other one, and, in our case, for example,
- the DRM (DE) device must call vblank functions which are handled in
  the CRTC (TCON) device, and
- the CRTC device must call DE initialization functions at startup time.

Looking at the harder case (A83T), there may be 8 planes on 2 channels.
Using a primary plane and the cursor,
	8 planes - primary plane - cursor plane =3D 6 planes
6 planes are available.
If I count correctly, in your example:
	one camera + one VPU + one application =3D 3 planes
3 planes are used.
So, 3 planes are still available.

On the other side, removing the cursor would just let one more plane.
Do we really need this one? In other words, I'd be pleased to know how
you run 7 applications doing video overlay.
