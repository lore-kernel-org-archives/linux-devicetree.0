no, it is for this patch. I did a specific commit message for the secon=
d
patch. IIRC, it also has the example if it was the meaning of your
question.

I do not think it needs a separate change (to simplify bisect for
instance) because the mutex protection can safely be removed here
around the two tests because the first read (to check oscillator bit)
and second read (to get time if oscillator bit is ok) we are doing on
the device do not need to be globally protected: oscillator bit is not
something we will update in such a way it would out of sync with the
current state of the time value kept by the device. More precisely, in
isl12057_rtc_set_time(), we do update the oscillator but only *after*
the time has been set to a valid value.

Cheers,
