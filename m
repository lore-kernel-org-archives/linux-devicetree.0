To be quite frank, I completely disagree with that stance.

It seems like the only reason DT bindings aren't remaining stable is
because people are deliberately ignoring the requirement and reasoning
for doing so.

I agree that it can be painful, and that we cannot predict the future.
There will always be bugs.

Having code in mainline comes with responsibilities. One of those is to
keep said code working for existing users. Otherwise, why bother having
it in mainline at all?

Mark.
