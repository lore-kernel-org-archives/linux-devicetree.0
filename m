Of course and that=E2=80=99s the point. No-one is going to remove the v=
anilla
DTSs for the beaglebone black. If you don=E2=80=99t want to use this ca=
pability
there won=E2=80=99t be any impact.

The EEPROM probe is only triggered by the presence of the quirk node,
so if you don=E2=80=99t boot with a DTB that contains it there is no ch=
ange
in the boot process.

The beaglebone is just an open source friendly platform that I can
demonstrate the capability.
