Other architectures allow simply appending the device tree to the
kernel image file, which is more convenient for users and does
not require much kernel support. Have you tried this?

device_initcall is run rather late. I think it would be more useful
to run this as early as possible, in order to make it possible to
have more of the core services probed through the device tree.

I also think that for probing the device tree root, you should be
using of_platform_populate instead of of_platform_bus_probe
nowadays. Maybe Grant can provide more information on this.
