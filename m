No.

Take a look at Patch 2/2, since the GPIO irqs are contiguous over both 
irq and hwirq numbers, I use the existing infrastructure with no 
modifications.

All moot as it is based on the false predicate of GPIO irqs being the 
problem.


The root of the problem are all of the irqs that are not GPIO.  I have:

o irq numbers currently in the range [9..196], with holes for any given 
SOC/Board implementation.  SOCs currently in development will have 
additional irq numbers with even more holes.

o Two different interrupt controllers.  One with 128 lines, the other 
with  512 or more lines, both sparsely populated.  The mapping of hwirq 
to irq is done at boot time based on the hardware the kernel image is 
running on.  Note that the second type of irq controller support is not 
in the kernel.org kernel, but it exists, and I intend on getting support 
for it merged ASAP.

At a minimum the loop in irq_domain_add() where we iterate over a linear 
range of irq numbers is not flexible enough.  You may not like my 
iterator functions in irq_domain_ops, but we need to provide something 
better than the irq_domain_for_each_irq() macro.
