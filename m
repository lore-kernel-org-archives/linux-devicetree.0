I will remove those policies (which means including all dependencies). 
As said below, I already thought it was evil premature optimization (I 
did in order to make the graph a bit smaller and to save some bytes). 
(No date, it isn't a paid project so I will do it whenever I feel good 
to do so).

Hmm, discussion about what? Those dependencies or about semantic checks?

Btw., if someone has a problem with the necessary time to do the 
topological sort at boot time (needs a few ms on a single core omap with 
600 MHz), there could be an additional option to add a new property 
which includes the whole (already topological sorted) list. That 
wouldn't be much effort. But currently I don't think any DT enabled 
device is in need of having to avoid doing the topological sort itself.
