Then how do you argue that you have to share the gate clock register
with every PLL? The answer is quite simple: You are not separating by
HW either but existing SW API.

If you would really want to just describe the HW, then you'd have to
have a single node for _all_ clocks that get controlled by 0xea0700/0x4,
feed some 32+ clocks into the node, and out again. Obviously, this
isn't what we want, right?

So, the idea of berlin2 sysctrl nodes (and similar other SoCs) is: Some
SoCs just dump some functions into a bunch of registers with no
particular order. We'd never find a good representation for that in DT,
so we don't bother to try but let the driver implementation deal with
the mess. Using "simple-mfd" is a nice solution to scattered registers
please have a look at it and come up with a cleaner separation for bg4
clock.

Why didn't you choose to have a memory-controller node that provides
mempll clock then? I am open to having multiple nodes providing clocks
but having a node for every clock in any subsystem is something I'll
not even think about.

I think that the current separation is not a good one. I am open for
suggestions but I am not accepting single PLL/clock nodes.

These SoC (at least mvebu) didn't merge them into a single clock
complex node because nobody had a better idea or an impression of
the consequences. Looking back with the idea of syscon/simple-mfd
we probably would have chosen to separate differently.

To repeat: "please just follow the OF/driver structure we already
have for Berlin2"
