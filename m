Yes. And that's already supported using the pinctrl-entries property;
you can reference n nodes at once for each named state in pinctrl-names,
and each of those nodes could easily be from a different pin controller.

I think it makes sense to describe everything in one place. It's much
easier to ensure everything is consistent and correct if you don't have
to cross-check two sources of data for the same thing.

That can be supported pretty easily.

The driver for a simple device can require two named states: "active"
and "standby". In your more complex example, the driver can require
three named states: "active", "standby", "standby-wake". During suspend,
it'll simply select the appropriate of the latter two states based on
user request.

You can even retrofit this capability to a previously simple driver that
Originally did:

suspend() {
    pinconf_select(dev, "suspend");
}

To make it do the following instead:

suspend() {
    if (wake)
        state = "suspend-wake";
    else
        state = "suspend-nowake";
    err = pinconf_select(dev, state);
    if (err < 0)
        pinconf_select(dev, "suspend";
}

... which should allow old device trees to work fine, but new device
trees to specify a different if they need.

Mux and config are two unrelated things though. Mux is the function
(signal, alternate function, mission mode, ...) that is selected for
the pin/group in question. Config is anything else, but explicitly not
mux, such as pull-up, pull-down, tri-state, drive-strength, etc.

That's true, but people have already discussed the usefulness of having
multiple named states, e.g. an SDHCI controller that needs different pin
configuration (perhaps drive strength or slew rate?) depending on the
clock rate of the SD interface itself.

But how will they configure suspend/off states in a generic way using the
pinctrl API if the pinctrl API has no way of knowing how to configure the
pins in suspend...
