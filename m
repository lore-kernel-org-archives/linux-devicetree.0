No worries. Having lost a few days exploring the core and call sites,
and having seen how widesrpead IRQF_NO_SUSPEND misuse is, it's beginning
to grate on me too.

a device may operate and raise interrupts during suspend.

So the fun part is how we solve this within Linux.

I assume you mean we return false in this case (having triggered the
wakeup within irq_pm_check_wakeup, which returned true), but otherwise
agreed.

I can envisage problems if the irq handler of a wakeup device can't be
run safely until resume time, though I'm not sure if that happens in
practice given the device is necessarily going to be active.

This would be a lot easier to follow/review as an RFC post to the
mailing list. Otherwise I have some high-level comments on the stuff
below, which I think matches the shape of what we discussed on IRC.

We might need to add some logic to enable_irq_wake and
irq_pm_install_action to prevent some of the horrible mismatch cases we
can get here (e.g. if we have a wakeup handler, a IRQF_NO_SUSPEND
handler, and another handler which is neither). We may need to
reconsider temporarily stashing the other potential interrupts.

Do we perhaps need an IRQF_SHARED_WAKEUP_SIBLING_OK for timer drivers to
assert their handlers are safe for the whole suspend period rather than
just the period they expect to be enabled for? Or do those always
happen to be safe in practice?

The irq_pm_force_wakeup part looks like what I had in mind.

It might be simpler to do this with a PM notifier within the driver
rather than having to traverse all the irq_descs, though perhaps not.

That should be fine; it's backed up in the list archive ;)

Hopefully the above covers that!
