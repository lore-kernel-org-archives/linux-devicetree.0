FWIW...

The Lubbock is an ancient development board (circa 2003) using a CPLD to 
multiplex a couple things on the board.  I really doubt anyone would 
reprogram this CPLD at this point. So I'd treat it just like another 
interrupt controller + random peripherals that will never change.  And 
yes, maybe a more appropriate name is needed.

And I happen to have one such beast on my desk wasting significant 
realestate and picking up dust.  I don't think I booted it even once in 
the last 3 years.  I'm seriously considering a trip to the recycling 
facility to dispose of it unless someone wants it and is ready to pay 
for the shipping.
