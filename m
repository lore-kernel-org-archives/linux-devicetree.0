I did not mean that you could not make your shot at generic codec. It 
will just need more work before it is generic enough for other HDMI 
encoders to fully utilize it.

BTW, the HDMI codec is now completely unused, since my OMAP4+ HDMI audio 
patches were merged (it uses dummy codec) and my BBB HDMI audio patches 
were never merged.

But then again if you'll rather make a tda998x specific codec for now, I 
am fine with that. Let's see later when(/if) I get my generic HDMI codec 
ready - I'll eventually need something for SiI9022 - if it makes sense 
to start using it with tda998x too.

Best regards,
Jyri
