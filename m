Actually, I don't know of any specific case that needs this commit.
The present series without this patch passes on all the boards in
kernelci, but Grygorii Strashko argued for it during the review of the
earlier version of this series:
http://lkml.kernel.org/g/55CE3D04.8000607@ti.com

IMO it would be better to not apply this patch until the need arises,
and even then, it may be better to make the dependencies explicit
instead of relying on implicit ordering and messing with the link
order.

With the rest of the series this shouldn't happen as all/most deferred
probes should be avoided.
