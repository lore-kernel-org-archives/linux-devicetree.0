*BSD are the main ones to consider here.

Note the "dynamic" bit - the configuration changes at runtime.
Describing the hardware for something like a modern smartphone isn't
particularly useful due to the flexibility, there are too many different
ways of configuring the system and we need code to acutally take those
decision.

Still an open issue.
