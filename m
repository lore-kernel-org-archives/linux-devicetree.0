Thanks for the detail information. I have the concerns about the distance
for NUMA nodes, does the "ibm,associativity-reference-points" property can
represent the distance between NUMA nodes?

For example, a system with 4 sockets connected like below:

Socket 0  <---->  Socket 1  <---->  Socket 2  <---->  Socket 3

So from socket 0 to socket 1 (maybe on the same board), it just need 1
jump to access the memory, but from socket 0 to socket 2/3, it needs
2/3 jumps and the *distance* relative longer. Can
"ibm,associativity-reference-points" property cover this?

Thanks
Hanjun
