I looked up the threads and found:

  http://marc.info/?w=4&r=1&s=Fix+up+fsl-flexcan+device+tree+bi&q=t

In the Flexcan driver we currently only have:

  static struct of_device_id flexcan_of_match[] = {
        {
                .compatible = "fsl,p1010-flexcan",
        },
        {},
  };

What compatible string do they actually use for the i.MX6Q board? Shawn
or Hui? We need to fix that. From the discussion mentioned above I think
"fsl,flexcan-v10" would be acceptable. Unfortunately, we do not known
the internal version of the Flexcan controllers used in the various
PowerPC and ARM SOCs. We already realized some differences with
interrupts and bus error handling between i.MX28 and i.MX35. Would be
nice if someone (from Freescale?) could finally clarify that.

Wolfgang.
