That's not really true though. A device might usually be little-endian,
regardless of the endianness of a CPU. Some vendors may integrate it as
big-endian after a binding is added, and in the absence of a specified
endianness a driver is likely to assume LE.

I am not keen on stating in such a generic document that the device is
the same endianness as the CPU. As some CPUs can change endianness
dynamically it's meaningless to say so.

As stated above, I disagree with this statement.

The endianness of the CPU should have nothing to do with the device
description. The DT should not consider the endianness of the CPU at all
because this can be a dynamic property of the system.  The kernel knows
which endianness the CPU is in, and in some cases the kernel will have
explicitly changed the endianness of the CPU.

All this document needs to say is that if a device may be integrated
with little-endian or big-endian registers, the preferred way to
distinguish between these cases is with a boolean big-endian or
little-endian property. Whether this is required and what the default
happens to be is entirely binding specific.

For those cases where the endianness of sub-componenets may vary (i.e. a
single regsiter may vary endianness, or a whole sub-block), then
big-endian-* and little-endian-* properties are the preferred way to
describe this.

This definitely cannot be required in general. We already have bindings
which optionally use this style of property.

Cheers,
Mark.
