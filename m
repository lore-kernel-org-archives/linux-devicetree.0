Makes sense, I don't think we saw problems with that, but you are right,
better safe than sorry.

We actually saw a page table walk miss, which is why we cache the
DDR_PHY_STATUS_REG translation by accessing it prior to suspending
(confirmed by seeing a TLB miss using the PMU). In practice this
resulted in an abnormally longer resume delay (200ms vs. several
microseconds) but no crashes. Other than that, I recall now that Russell
suggested making the SRAM __arm_ioremap_exec() non-cacheable for safety,
I will do that in v3.

Well, this code has been used in production for millions of
suspend/resume cycles and has proven to be robust enough, I don't object
the scenario you are describing could exist, but I am not sure we could
come up with an alternative which is not incredibly complex.

A possibly different approach I suppose could be to relocate this code
into an identify mapping and do a late MMU off, suspend, followed by DDR
bring-up and MMU on, that sounds much more complex, and we would have to
run this through our regression test suite for several thousands of
cycles to confirm the validity of this approach.

Thanks for the feedback!
