Actually I'm not sure how we could probe the ascendants on demand, as
currently the parent's device lock is taken when probing so trying to
probe a sibling from within a probe callback will cause a deadlock.

AFAICS this is only needed for USB interface devices and this
behaviour could be limited to them, but I don't like much assuming
that no USB device will ever have a dependency on a sibling (though
that probably won't happen ever).
