>>> Non of these Yocto patches are actually needed. The culprit is the .oper_speed setting to be 4Mbps. Once you reduce that to 921600 thing will start to work smoothly. I sent a patch that takes the .oper_speed out completely and only applies it for the ACPI based devices where we know that it works.

I converted it into being a vendor diagnostic packet.

< HCI Command: Broadcom Launch RAM (0x3f|0x004e) plen 4
        Address: 0xffffffff
> HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 4
      Broadcom Launch RAM (0x3f|0x004e) ncmd 1
        Status: Success (0x00)
= Vendor Diagnostic (len 0)
< HCI Command: Broadcom Update UART Baud Rate (0x3f|0x0018) plen 6
        00 00 00 10 0e 00                                ......          
> HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 4
      Broadcom Update UART Baud Rate (0x3f|0x0018) ncmd 1
        Status: Success (0x00)
< HCI Command: Reset (0x03|0x0003) plen 0
> HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 4
      Reset (0x03|0x0003) ncmd 1
        Status: Success (0x00)

So it comes right after the firmware launch command. Which means this is just an indication there. My assumption it safe to just silence this empty packet. Or maybe actually leaving it as empty vendor diagnostic packet is just fine as well. Then we would actually know how often it happens.

+#define BCM_RECV_NULL \
+       .type = BCM_NULL_PKT, \
+       .hlen = BCM_NULL_SIZE, \
+       .loff = 0, \
+       .lsize = 0, \
+       .maxlen = BCM_NULL_SIZE
+
 static const struct h4_recv_pkt bcm_recv_pkts[] = {
        { H4_RECV_ACL,      .recv = hci_recv_frame },
        { H4_RECV_SCO,      .recv = hci_recv_frame },
        { H4_RECV_EVENT,    .recv = hci_recv_frame },
        { BCM_RECV_LM_DIAG, .recv = hci_recv_diag  },
+       { BCM_RECV_NULL,    .recv = hci_recv_diag  },
 };
