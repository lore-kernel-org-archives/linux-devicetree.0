Is the GPIO fix something that will go in v4.9-rc cycle ?

Hmm, I would not have expected PIO mode to be so inefficient that you
are unable to even read the block device.

Sigh. This is quite an abuse :)

I know we don't have a good way to configure this in kernel today. And I
am surprised we never had to care about disabling pullups so far. Can
you clarify why you need it? I assume there is some contention you want
to avoid, but on which interface?

I dont think this can be done this way using pinctrl-single. A small
driver to handle pullup/down control for da850 may have to be added to
drivers/pinctrl. It will be better to check with Linus Walleij on his
thoughts using a new thread ccing the pinctrl subsystem list as well.

I see that this is not really used. Can you add these when you actually
use them. Looks like that applies to some other definitions like this below.

Hmm, disabled? Can you add this node when you actually use it?

same here and other places below.

Thats 256KB for U-Boot and MLO (I assume in concatenated AIS image). Is
that sufficient for future too? Moving partitions later is tough ask
because that means users will lose data when they upgrade the kernel
because of partitions moving around. Just a suggestion to keep future
U-Boot bloat in mind and not use a "just fits" number.

I would drop this comment.

Add this node when you actually have display working.
