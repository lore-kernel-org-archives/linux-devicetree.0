It is known statically and is determined through simulations according to the SoC design.
It is later verified on chip. Once verified, these values never change. 
Values change from one SoC to another.

There are some very safe values but they are not correct until validated on the chip.

First one. 

As I said on another email, The HIDMA channel driver resets the transfer and event channels 
before using them. The reset command is intended for the HIDMA HW itself.

The channel probe will fail with reset failed message.

This is a HW parameter. The OS doesn't use timers or any other facility to time correctness. 

The HIDMA channel driver issues a reset and then waits for confirmation while polling a status
register. If no confirmation is received, then the HW is assumed broken or incorrectly configured.
The HW channel is removed from the OS access.

The HIDMA management driver programs this value to the HW. It is not consumed by the OS directly.

It is a requirement of the HW. Not the OS.
