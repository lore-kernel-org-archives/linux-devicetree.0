Hi all,

ARM System Control and Management Interface(SCMI) is more flexible and
easily extensible than any of the existing interfaces. Many vendors were
involved in the making of this formal specification and is now published[1].

There is a strong trend in the industry to provide micro-controllers in
systems to abstract various power, or other system management tasks.
These controllers usually have similar interfaces, both in terms of the
functions that are provided by them, and in terms of how requests are
communicated to them.

This specification is to standardise and avoid (any further)
fragmentation in the design of such interface by various vendors.

It currently doesn't support notification, asynchronous/delayed response,
perf/power statistics region and sensor register region to name a few.
Some of the ideas of message allocation/management are borrowed from TI SCI.

Changes:

v5[7]->v6:
	- Dropped notification APIs as it's not fully supported, leftovers
	  from development
	- Removed unnecessary mutex usage for allocation
	- Replace udelay with cpu_relax, found nice helper spin_until_cond
	- Added inline to couple of functions in header files
	- Fixed few checkpatch errors

v4[6]->v5:
	- Rebased to v4.15-rc6
	- Updated all the gathered Ack/Reviewed-by tags(which includes
	  all the drivers using SCMI protocol)

v3[5]->v4[6]:
	- Added SCMI protocol bus to enumerate supported protocols as
	  suggested by Arnd
	- Dropped the abstraction to mailbox as it may be optional

v2[4]->v3:
	- Addressed various comments received so far(clock, hwmon and
	  cpufreq drivers along with scmi drivers)
	- Hwmon driver now uses core layer to create and manage sysfs
	  attributes
	- Added a shim layer to abstract the mailbox interface to support
	  any custom adaptation required by the controller driver
	- Simple ARM MHU shim layer using newly added abstraction

v1[3]->v2[4]:
	- Additional support for polling based DVFS and per protocol
	  channels
	- Dependent drivers(clock, hwmon, cpufreq and power domains)
	- Various other review comments and issued found during testing
	  addressed
	- Explicit binding for method dropped as even SMC based method
	  are adviertised as mailbox

RFC[2]->v1[3]:
	- Add generic mailbox binding for shared memory(Rob H)
	- Dropped compatibles per protocol(Suggested by Matt S)
	- Dropped lot of unnecessary pointer casting(Arnd B)
	- Dropped packing of structures(Arnd B)
	- Few other changes/additions based initial testing with firmware
	  providing SCMI interface to OSPM
