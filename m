OK, so your threshold is 100 lines, mine is 3. Agree to disagree?

Can we maybe tone it down and not make this sound like a struggle of
"good vs. evil"?

That's your POV, mine is that I save a couple of lines and things are
still consistent.

Nope, that slippery slope doesn't exist at all. We have a clear
boundary/decision criteria of common vendor.

As I said, let's leave this decision up to the maintainers and avoid
continuing having this argument where neither party convinces another.
