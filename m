I'm not just hinting at that, I've openly stated it quite a few times
now!  :P  For the simpler CODECs it's kind of marginal if you need to
bother but for anything more complex (even things with PLLs) it seems
like the way forwards.

It's still useful in that we can consistently manage the clocks external
to the CODEC that way, especially when looking at systems where it is
useful to dynamically start and stop the clocks.

I'd expect that a clock consumer should (like a regulator consumer can)
be able to figure out what constraints there are on the rates it has
set.  Those could be fixed restrictions but it'd be good to also have
ways for other actors in the system to change things at runtime.

Yup.  I really should chase to see if that actually got accepted or
not...=20
