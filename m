Thanks Rob for quick review,

Not ATM, The reason for making this property global is to mark the 
complete nvmem to be readonly/read-write. Which most of the use-cases 
will have. Currently this property is used for setting permissions on 
the sysfs binary file, also it would be impossible to apply per field 
read-only property to such file.

Am also planning to send few patches on top of these to expose fields in 
sysfs which would then allow us to use per field read-only property.
Again not sure how the direct access to nvmem would fit in with such 
requirements. Need to evaluate this option in more detail though. :-)

Thats another possible way to specify the same info, Only reason I came 
up with bit-offset and nbits is due to the fact that similar properties 
were seen in other device DT bindings.

I will try your suggestion and see how it looks before I send new version.

I wanted to keep things simple for this first version.
