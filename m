Hi Lee, Pete,

The coprocessor memory map defined below is for test. Addresses have been arbitrary fixed.
The audio and video firmware you want to use are for product configuration.
For sure memory mapping must be adapted or firmware recompiled.

About coherency between firmware characteristics (linked address, position independent or not, size) and DT definition, you're right, some checks are missing in this version. It shouldn't be possible to load/start a firmware if DT reserved memory is not aligned with firmware resource table and firmware start address.

Lee, I propose to have a short discussion during next ST LT weekly meeting to list missing features and identify ST internal remoteproc patches for upstream.

Regards,
Loic
