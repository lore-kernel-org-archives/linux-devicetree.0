Heh, I didn't address the rebind triggering part at all, and while I'm by
no means responsible or have any deep knowledge, I thought this was true:

- driver .remove for the device owning the drm_bridge is what typically
  calls drm_bridge_remove()
- driver .remove is called as part of the device being unbound from the
  driver by the bus (i2c in this case)
- by registering a link to the consumer, this unbinding will trigger the
  removal of this main drm consumer device as part of the unbinding
- so everything aboput the drm device will be torn down, and everything
  will thus have to be reprobed to get things back

But I could easily have misunderstood just about everything in the above...

And maybe it's really inconvenient to have to trigger a reprobe of the
whole drm cluster? Maybe all drm driver parts should be components?

I have no idea.

Cheers,
Peter

PS. compile-tested the below and drm_bridge.c needs to
#include <drm/drm_device.h>
