Alright, I'll try to use more of the framework provided.  I tried to use
one of the Wolfson codecs as an example.  Is there a "canonical" driver
that's up-to-date and uses an appreciable amount of framework?

Where can I read up on DAPM routes?  I don't see the word "route"
mentioned in the dapm.txt SoC documentation.

Sloppy.  I'll fix this in the next revision.

The codec has very strict power sequencing.  If I'm understanding the
document correctly, I'd add a DAPM widget for the DAC, and then register
a widget event for when the DAC gets opened, and do power sequencing
there?  Or is there a way to have multiple register writes defined as a
single DAPM widget?

The frequency is a specific divider defined in the datasheet.  There is
a table of frequencies and dividers for various frequencies.  One option
is to code this table into the driver and pick the frequency clocks out
of the table.

I decided to assume the codec has a fixed input frequency of 22.5792
MHz.  This means the codec can support 11.025, 22.05, and 44.1 kHz, but
cannot support 48 kHz.  It should be possible to instead feed the codec
a 24 MHz clock and run it at 48 kHz.  Pulseaudio runs at 44.1 by
default, so I went with that.

Oops.  Leftover from some anti-pop work I did earlier.  I'll remove it.

My fault for omitting one.
Much of the code in adc_enable() and dac_enable() come from the
reference manual.  They indicate that the codec has very strict ordering
requirements on registers that must be set during playback and
recording.  Again, is there any way to ensure that hw_params(),
set_dai_fmt(), and the DAPM widgets are called in a specific order?

Thank you for the feedback.
