This really isn't an OK approach here, you're making a whole bunch of
assumptions about how the system is implemented that aren't robust and
will lead to loss of audio if things go wrong which is a pretty serious
consequence.  Are you *sure* there's going to be a quick enough response
to cover all jack inserts and remove (especially under load), or that
userspace even bothers paying attention given that there's no other
input and output devices?

Yes, you're going to have to do something like that if you want to do
this - you'll also need to lock the reads since otherwise userspace will
see the intermediate control states.

There's regcache_sync_region().

OK, please document this then.

IIRC you had some DAPM updates in adjacent code?

Yes - the user has explicitly tried to set something and the driver is
ignoring it.

Again some documentation would help, and also using raw reads rather
than bulk reads (which imply that all endianness issues will be taken
care of).  If you're doing a bulk read and handling endianness that's
worrying.  You should also have an endianness annotation for val.

Yes, you want a VALUE_ENUM.

It's always been the naming in ControlNames.txt - we don't generally
worry about it on devices with more flexible routing which mean that the
associated meaning won't always be really true but for this device it
seems that the options are sufficiently limited to allow userspace to
use the standard name.

That should work I think.  The point here isn't really the control of
the LDO itself, it's making sure that the integration with external
supplies works well - the key bit is that how we figure out that we
don't have an external supply connected should be joined up with how we
normally integrate external supplies.

It seems likely to be more robust against someone realising that the
register bits actually do something useful and need toggling and it
raises less eyebrows code wise.

If you're worried about the register writes you should also be able to
arrange to map these in as mixer widgets which would mean that the the
core will combine the writes with the main power controls.
