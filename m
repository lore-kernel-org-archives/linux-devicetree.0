And also arm64 at the least.

Actually, powerpc seems to be the only OF platform reimplementing this =
function.
s390 and x86 are not OF platforms.

Don't forget that my patchset aims to replace existing house-made code =
with a more
generic version. When architectures and platforms switch to my code the=
y will have
to add this back in their code if it's needed.

Well, it will become necessary as old code gets dismantled and converte=
d towards
this patchset. To give you an example that I'm familiar with, for arch/=
arm the
host bridge drivers have moved into drivers/pci/host, but they still de=
pend/use
the bios32 infrastructure that takes care of setting up the irq. When t=
hey switch
to my version they would have to go and debug the "irq not being assign=
ed" issue
and it is quite likely that some of the people doing the conversion wil=
l complain
about my code rather than understanding the issue. What I'm trying to d=
o is to
make switching to my patchset as painless as possible, with a cleanup t=
o remove
redundant operations coming after the switchover.

Does that sound like a reasonable plan?

Best regards,
Liviu
