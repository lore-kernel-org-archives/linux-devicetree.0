The patch

   ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Add support for A83T

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Add support for A83T

The I2S controller in the A83T is mostly compatible with the one found
in earlier SoCs such as the A20 and A31. While the documents publicly
available for the A83T do not cover this hardware, the officially
released BSP kernel does have register definitions for it. These were
matched against the A20 user manual. The only difference is the TX FIFO
and interrupt status registers have been swapped around, like what we
have seen with the SPDIF controller.

This patch adds support for this hardware.
