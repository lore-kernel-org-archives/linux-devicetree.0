Hi guys [particularly Jason and Thierry],

sorry for the prolonged silence, here I am back again...

So you mean that, assuming I knew the topology, I could populate the 
device tree in advance (e.g. statically), so that it already includes 
*devices* which will be further discovered during probing?
Or else you mean the {firmware,u-boot} can do that prior to starting the OS?
If either of the above is true, could you please suggest some example 
(or some way to get one)?
I assume the "reg" property (and the after-"@" node name) will need to 
encode (at least) the device number, is that right?

I tried reading the "PCI Bus Binding to Open Firmware" but I could not 
make complete sense out of it...

Could you please give a pointer to some example of this? I'm not quite 
sure I understand what you guys are talking about.

I'm not 100% sure I made myself clear though.
What I would like to do is to have *other* parts of the device tree be 
able to reference (i.e., connect to, through phandles) a PCI device 
(because it provides a GPIO, for instance).
Is that also what you mean?

Yes, I guess in that case (if ever) we would need some other way that 
the device number (is that the same as the physical slot?) to specify a 
particular "hotplug" device (i.e. maybe a serial number or so)?
But that's definitely out of scope here.

Agreed.

Thanks again for your patience...
