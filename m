Is the SRC just a single block sitting between the DMA and the external
audio port or is there more going on?  Some of the other code made me
think the hardware was more flexible than this (all the writing to
registers with names like RXSEL for example).

I'd expect this code to be structured more like a library - have a
driver that handles the specific IPs then have it call into a shared
block of code that does the generic bits.  Though in this case the
device specific bit looks like a couple of tiny data tables so I'm not
sure it's worth making it conditional or separate at all.

Yes.

At least.  I do think we need to get to the bottom of how flexible the
hardware is first though.
