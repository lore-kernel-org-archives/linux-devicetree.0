Hi Lee,

Thanks for submitting the series.

It has been a little while since v6. It would be helpful to remind me of
why a new api is necessary, versus using the existing clk_prepare_unused
call at the time that a clock is enabled.

I'm looking over the patches in detail now, but one question stands out:
besides the DT use case, would a Linux device driver ever call
clk_enable_critical instead of using clk_enable? If so, why?

Thanks,
Mike
