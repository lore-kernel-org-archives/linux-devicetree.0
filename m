which is a shame as it was sneaked past the dmaengine community!!

This is the *only* example and there and other examples where people use
dmaengine:

$ grep -rl dmaengine_prep* drivers/crypto/* |uniq
drivers/crypto/atmel-aes.c
drivers/crypto/atmel-sha.c
drivers/crypto/atmel-tdes.c
drivers/crypto/img-hash.c
drivers/crypto/omap-aes.c
drivers/crypto/omap-des.c
drivers/crypto/omap-sham.c
drivers/crypto/qce/dma.c
drivers/crypto/stm32/stm32-hash.c
drivers/crypto/ux500/cryp/cryp_core.c
drivers/crypto/ux500/hash/hash_core.c

that is a very good question, perf does matter. Given that we have many
folks using it, I think it would help, but yes nothing better than numbers
speak for themselves.
