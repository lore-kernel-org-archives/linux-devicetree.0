Although I'm not a big fan of explaining, yet, I still want to say that
actually I've balanced this way and your last suggestion against the v1.

It'd be surely better to distinguish two platforms as you suggested if
we are looking at this change alone since the change is nearly tiny and
the code to specify them wouldn't be quite a lot. However, there's more
work to do based on this patch, an auto-selecting clock source mechanism
for SAI as a DAI master for example, which would need to drop the existing
code and to add the new one. If vf610 is still using the old one, it would
not benefit from the further feature and the code would be definitely ugly
as we would have to add too many platform checks. So personally I prefer
this reasonable change than the little sacrifice we're going to make here.

Right now I feel grateful for what Sascha suggested to the DT bindings of
fsl-spdif. It was a painstaking experience when getting it upstream last
year but what's done at that moment makes the driver more flexible. So I
think we should do the strict and comprehensive review for the clock part
to every module from now on since an once-defined-DT-binding would be so
painful to improved for us.

Thank you,
Nicolin
