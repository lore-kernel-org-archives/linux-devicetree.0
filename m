As these are dai-link level properties the idea is to set constraints to 
sample-width on the digital audio link, usually i2s. That is why the 
constraint is set based on sample-width and not physical width.

The number if significant bits in the sample-word should in a normal 
case be a property of the codec, if such a property is needed. On the 
other hand the limits for the physical layout in the system memory are 
usually set by the platform driver (= DMA HW), so such a property should 
- in a normal case - go to cpu-dai node. Since these cases can usually 
be associated to either end of the link, there should be no need for 
such properties in the machine driver.

I am not sure what you have in mind with the TDM case. In some cases a 
similar constraint property for number of channels could help.

Best regards,
Jyri
