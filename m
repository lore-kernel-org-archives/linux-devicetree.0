I'm not sure I agree with this last point:

Arguably, fw_cfg could be viewed as a glorified out-of-band USB stick
with special files prepared by QEMU for the guest VM.

The sysfs driver is a mechanism to list/access these files, and is
IMHO the only thing one can reasonably construe as "kernel interface".

What you're suggesting boils down to adding a translation layer between
what QEMU names the files when preparing this magic USB stick, and what
we tell users the names are (by adding additional folders named e.g.
"supported" and "unsupported").

That to me looks like injecting policy ("look *here*, NOT there!") by
doing this, instead of sticking with mechanism only ("here's what qemu
wrote to fw_cfg, look at it if you want, or don't...").

While I understand your concerns, I'm not sure we should have to go
through this level of convolution to protect people from their own
mistakes (such as assuming certain content on the magic USB stick will
always be there, and writing some sort of script which would break if
said content mysteriously disappears, then reasonably complain about
either the sysfs kernel driver or qemu itself). Presence or absence of
some file on a magic USB stick does NOT (again, IMHO) an interface make...

I was thinking of maybe adding a module parameter, let's call it
"show-all", off by default, and which would cause the "by-name" folder
to only be populated by things starting with "opt" when off, and
all fw-cfg files when enabled. But I'm not sure I like having to do it
in the first place (particularly hardcoding the string "opt" anywhere
in the driver :) ) so let me think about this a bit more (additional
pro/con thoughs and opinions welcome!)...

Thanks,
