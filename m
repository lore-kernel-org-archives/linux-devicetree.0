I've played with this a bit too much, and have basically rewritten the
whole SEI driver (see [1] for the resulting patch, which doesn't leave
much unchanged).

It also requires some changes[2] to the ICU driver, which assumes that
the SEI and GICP have similar interrupt flows (news flash, they don't).
I still hate the way this driver is written (no clear separation
between what is essentially two different drivers bolted together), but
that's a different story.

I'm also very worried that ICU-SEI interrupts are handled as edge,
while they are level. The HW doesn't seem to offer any facility to
resample the level, so this looks broken by design. Maybe the Marvell
people on Cc could shed some light on how they expect this to work?

As for the thermal stuff, the DT is wrong (see [3]).

I've tested it by letting the machine overheat, and take thermal
interrupts on both AP and CP. The box shutdowns cleanly in both cases,
so I guess it somehow works.

Thanks,

	M.
