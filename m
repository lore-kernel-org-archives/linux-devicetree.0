Ok.

Exactly, that is why I was thinking it would take less "review" time.
Indeed, if there is no driver, why would it matter what those bindings
are?

Indeed. So you agree that without a driver, there is no backward compatibility
to maintain (because nothing could break).
Could we then say that in that case, it should not matter that much (if at all)
if the bindings have "a reasonable chance of being good enough"?

Because I'm trying to understand why/how would the "open-source community" be
affected by some DT properties/nodes that are not used by upstream Linux drivers.

Warner proposed 'overlays' to deal with the "open-source community" reticence to
accept such bindings.
Whereas it may be simpler to just find a way to accommodate the integration of
such bindings in a way that everybody wins.
That could take the form of a "staging" DT area, so that the 'overlay' is public.
Just for the sake and benefit of everybody, 3rd parties and open-source community.

Yes, but this is based on a binding for which there's a driver.
If there's no driver it should not take that much time, right?

Only for bindings for which there is a driver.

Think about this:
- a binding with no driver is submitted and ends up in the tree
(it could be on a staging area if necessary)

- if at a later point somebody attempts to upstream a driver using those
'staging' bindings, the reviewers could say "you are using 'staging' bindings,
please add compatibility with 'staging' and 'standard' bindings", even if that
includes the discussion and review of newly created 'standard' bindings
corresponding to the 'staging' bindings.

- the submitter may even say "there's no need for compatibility for 'staging'
bindings, because they were never used (or other valid reasons)".

What would you think of something like that?

No, it would not use a "different version of the binding", because the
binding would be public, i.e.: everything would be on the public DT.

Do you have an example of a binding *not used by Linux* that created enormous
amount of work for the Linux community?

Let's make an abstraction of the word 'binding', 'create a binding', etc. and
just focus on this:
- Somebody submits a DT file that contains properties and nodes that are
*not used* by any Linux driver.
- Said properties and nodes serve as HW description for HW blocks for which
*there is no* Linux driver.

The goal of the above is to use the DT as the authoritative (and single)
source of HW definition.

An alternate solution, as proposed by Warner, is to use 'binary overlays' for
the DT.

The benefit is that in one case (the case where the whole SoC is described
in the DT, regardless of the existence of a Linux driver or not) there is more
information available publicly.

Ok, so if the information is not relevant to Linux do you agree that it
should not affect it, and then we could imagine such details being present on
the DT anyway?

You mention the case of another OS.
What is the definition of OS in this case?
Because one could say that "FW" or "secure world" could fit that definition,
right?
Or when you talk about "another OS" you think only about other open-source
mainstream OSs, like FreeBSD?

I think we've made progress :-)
Indeed, to me it is clear that what we conceive "differently", is that
"the effort", "lack of benefit for the community", "Old bindings should
remain supported regardless" and "backward compatibility" are considered
with respect to DT *plus* driver, yet the idea is to have DT describe
HW for which there's no upstream driver yet.
Hence most of those considerations should not apply, right?

Sebastian
