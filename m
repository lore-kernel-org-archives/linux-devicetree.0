I would have though the bindings are stable, i.e the compatibility with
old DT would have been kept in newer kernel.

So is it something specific to cubietruck? If no, that's very
unfortunate because it means that you can't re-use the same DT across
multiple OS and the DT provided by the firmware (if it's built-in).
