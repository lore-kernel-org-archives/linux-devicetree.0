Hmm, no. That index doesn't describe a particular output of a clock 
phandle but an internal detail of the CPU or CODEC DAI on the other end. 
Most DAIs will use 0 here, like your code had it before.

The DAI can be both a producer and a consumer of a clock, depending on 
the audio clocking setup, and these details are not exposed in DT.



Thanks,
Daniel
