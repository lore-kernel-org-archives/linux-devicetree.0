Hi Laurent,

I would like to confirm the dependencies of this series with you.
As I understand things the dependencies that were not present
in renesas-devel-v3.13-rc2-20131211 are as follows.

If any of the patches below can be skipped without breaking this series
or the followup series "[PATCH v4 00/16] Lager and Koelsch multiplatform
support" then I am all for not treating them as dependencies at all.


* [PATCH v4 0/3] Renesas R-Car Gen2 Common Clock Framework drivers
  Status: Waiting for response from Mike Turquette

* mmc: sh_mobile_sdhi: Convert to clk_prepare/unprepare
  Status: Merged by Chris Ball. I believe we need a stable branch from him.

* spi: sh-msiof: Convert to clk_prepare/unprepare
  spi: sh-msiof: Use devm_* managed allocators
  Status: Merged by Mark Brown. I believe we need a stable branch from him.

* usb: gadget: r8a66597-udc: Convert to clk_prepare/unprepare
  Status: In Felipe Balbi's next branch. It is stable, right?

* clocksource: sh_tmu: Add clk_prepare/unprepare support
  clocksource: sh_tmu: Release clock when sh_tmu_register() fails
  clocksource: sh_mtu2: Add clk_prepare/unprepare support
  clocksource: sh_mtu2: Release clock when sh_mtu2_register() fails
  Status: Present in v3.13-rc3. No problem!

* clocksource: sh_cmt: Add clk_prepare/unprepare support
  Status: I think I have dropped the ball here.
          Regardless, I think it it needs to be accepted by Daniel Lezcano

* serial: sh-sci: Convert to clk_prepare/unprepare
  serial: sh-sci: Don't enable/disable port from within break timer
  Status: I have queued these up
