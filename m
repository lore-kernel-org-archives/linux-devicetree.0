I have not seen any significant new development since v7 of these 
patches. My comments for v6 were mostly[1] addressed and I can live with 
these changes, even develop this approach further if it gets merged.

However, as a general note I see a need for a generic ASoC hdmi codec 
abstraction and I don't think this is generic enough. More of the audio 
specific implementation and HDMI standard specific things should be 
pushed away from the hdmi encoder driver (tda998x in this case) to the 
generic ASoC side hdmi codec driver (or library).

I am currently working on something that tries to be a generic solution 
that should be usable for different encoders and platforms, but 
unfortunately I have been busy with other things lately and have not 
been able to put anything working together yet. As soon as I have at 
least a bare bone API and and a proof of concept implementation working, 
I send RFC/POF patches out.

Best regards,
Jyri

[1] I personally do not like the hdmi_get_cdev() approach. I would 
rather go with only a library for registering from ASoC codec component 
under the HDMI encoder device or a completely separate device with only 
a reference to the HDMI encoder.
