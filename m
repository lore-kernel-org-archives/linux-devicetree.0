The above definition doesn't support 2 or more as it is 1-1 with channels.

Could it ever be more than 1 cell?

I guess being in DT is fine, but I'm still not sure about the naming.
The current name suggests it is part of the mbox binding. Do we want
that or should it be SCMI specific? Then "data" is vague. Perhaps
"scmi-commands"?
