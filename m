I don't think a platform device would want an of_xlate_dai_name
function; a platform device is not what provides the DAI and hence it
shouldn't be involved in translating a DT DAI specifier into a DAI name.

Yes, putting the function into the CODEC driver makes sense.

I guess that snd_soc_register_dai() and snd_soc_register_dais() already
are the equivalent of snd_soc_register_cpu(); they are already passed
the struct device that implements the DAIs, and hence if you pass that
struct back to the DAI driver's of_xlate_dai_name function, it should
have enough information to do the mapping: the dev contains the platform
data the DAI driver can use to perform the mapping.

I guess the algorithm should be:

* Find a CODEC device that was instantiated from the DT node referenced
by the phandle.

* If found, ask the CODEC to translate, and use the result. This
function would be passed the CODEC pointer and phandle args.

* Find any DAI, that is not part of a CODEC, that was instantiated from
the DT node referenced by the phandle.

* If found, ask the driver of the DAI to translate. This function would
probably have to be passed the DT node as well as the first DAI you
found, plus the phandle args.

* If nothing found above, fail.
