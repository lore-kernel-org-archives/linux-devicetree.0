I agree with Russell here, purely hw description is not always going
to be enough information to know how to assemble a bag of parts into a
system.

Maybe there is some way we should be splitting this "meta" description
into different dt files or something like this (?) to make it easier
for alternative configurations, but if the hw description alone is not
enough information for the drivers to know what to do, some (for lack
of a better word) "use-case" configuration is needed, and that has to
go *somewhere*... better to put it in DT than hard code it in the
driver.
