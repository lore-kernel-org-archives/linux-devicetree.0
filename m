The other drivers simply abort probe() if they can't get clock, you
decided to allow probe() to finish and assume that clock is already
enabled, leaving kp->clk == ERR_PTR(-ENOENT) in your version. If you try
then calling clk_prepare_enable() with that pointer it is going to bomb,
that is why I said you need to check pointer validity in bcm_kp_start()
and bcm_kp_stop().

Thanks.
