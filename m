Huh? You're seemingly completely missing my point...

But you are right that _Neil's_ heading needs to be fixed, too:
Clearly not all GXL SoCs need to have an S905X compatible string!
So it should be "Boards with the Amlogic S905X SoC shall ..." or so.

Thanks, I already know that, that's why you have two compatible strings
instead of just one like for GXBB. We can certainly prepend one for
symmetry there, too, if it makes you happier.

I still don't follow that conclusion. The board is called "amlogic,p231"
because P231 is a unique identifier within the Amlogic namespace, so why
not call the SoC "amlogic,s905x" for the same reason? The documentation
is already there in having both "amlogic,s905x" _and_
"amlogic,meson-gxl" - please re-read my post. There is no S905X in GXL
family and another S905X in some other Amlogic SoC family, so it's
unique and there is no reason to encode any hierarchies into its name
other than vendor,name.

I'm not arguing over the file name, where it perfectly makes sense to
have a meson-gxl- prefix (already discussed), just about the compatible
string where we don't have "amlogic,meson-gxl-s905x-p231" either because
it is completely unnecessary and does _not_ add any value.

Not that we're checking this string anywhere anyway... If you want to
check for the GXL family you have to use "amlogic,meson-gxl"; if you
want to check for the specific SoC you use "amlogic,s905x". Simple. We
never match partial strings, so there is no sense in a hardcoded prefix
that is duplicating information already available.

Andreas
