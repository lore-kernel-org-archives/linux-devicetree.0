You can easily point a specific compatible property to a generic
implementation. My concern is just that the binding properties be
presented generically so everyone pays attention (hopefully).

At least in the FSL BSP, that was always just an optimization to avoid
walking the tree needlessly. I think it could be determined from parent
and child information in the DT.

To be clear, these are just proposed bindings, so they can be changed
still. In fact, Grant said at LPC that he wants to make some changes.
Perhaps Grant can chime in.

Honestly, I like your proposal better. I think having a single clock per
DT node is a good thing. This can simplify parsing the tree and should
make implementing generic code easier.

Do we need clock name strings on outputs or just phandles? Many
intermediate clocks don't really need a name other than the phandle name.

IIRC, Grant suggesting aligning with how doing reg names (aka
resource_byname) was agreed upon at LPC. Something like this:

clocks = <&clk_phandle1, &clk_phandle2>;
clock-names = <"clk1", "clk2">;

clock-names could then be optional.
