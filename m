I would drop the -audio postfix.
I know the McASP introduced this and it is annoying. Let's not repeat it ag=

Given that the driver is actually a driver for daVinci ASP and it completely
ignores registers introduced when the IP is renamed from ASP to McBSP, shou=
ld
we say something about this? That the ASP is compatible or subset of McBSP
(w/o the multichannel support) and these bindings could be used for ASP, wi=
th
adding new compatible?
Or just leave that out and bother with it when we have such a device booting
with DT?
