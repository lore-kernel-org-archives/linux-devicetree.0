This is generally considered a bug in the bindings, the bindings are for
cross-platform usage and should not be specific to any OS.

Other OSs are actively using device tree.

Eliminating board specific code for audio is not a realistic goal, the
configuration of modern audio subsystems is too complex and dynamic.  It
is realistic to make machine drivers which cover broad classes of
devices with similar hardware.

The plan is to push the device trees out of the kernel into a separate
repository.

Yes, it's a very basic part of AC'97.
