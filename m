Right. I mean you can feel free to do whichever works best for you. If it's easy
to combine the DT_MACHINE_START sections, then do, otherwise don't.

That would be even better. I think we should generally try do initialization
as late as possible, ideally from initcalls. The init_early() function should
only be used for code that absolutely has to be run from setup_arch() and
no later, while the map_io() function should ideally only be used to set up
the static mappings and nothing else.
