Typically, I don't think anything but ARM's Primecell peripherals have 
registers for probing. The GIC and PL310 don't have them.

However, this is what was used for an early version of the versatile dts:

compatible = "arm,amba-bus";

The SCU base address is probe-able:

	/* Get SCU base */
	asm("mrc p15, 4, %0, c15, c0, 0" : "=r" (base));

However, this is specific to the A9 and not an SCU feature.

The SCU is accessed before ioremap is up. The only reason it is accessed 
early is to determine the number of cores present.

The L2 can certainly be ioremapped and probed via DT. How about 
something like this:

	l2cc {
		compatible = "arm,pl310-l2";
		reg = <0xfff12000 0x1000>;
		aux-value = <0>;
		aux-mask = <0xffffffff>;
	};
