I'd like to see an input source be the kernel command line and/or a DT
chosen property. Another overlay manager was proposed not to long
ago[1] as well. There's also the Allwinner tablet use case from Hans
where i2c devices are probed and detected. That's not using overlays
currently, but maybe could.

Another thing to consider is different sources of overlays. Besides in
the filesystem, overlays could be built into the kernel (already
supported), embedded in the dtb (as the other overlay mgr did) or we
could extend FDT format to append them.

What about things like power has to be turned on first to detect
boards and read their ID? I think this needs to be tied into the
driver model. Though, don't go sticking cape mgr nodes into DT. Maybe
a driver gets bound to a connector node, but we've got to sort out
connector bindings first.

I thought there are firmware loading calls that will wait. I think
this all needs to work asynchronously both for firmware loading and
because w1 is really slow.

Having 2 would certainly give a better sense this is generic.
