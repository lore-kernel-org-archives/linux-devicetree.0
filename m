I don't follow this part entirely. Why are you expecting thrid parties
to write a driver for those blocks rather than upstreaming a driver for
them?

I would generally agree that the hardware should be described in DT.
The difficulty is that without a 'real' user it's not always possible to
tell if we're describing the thing correctly.

Putting smoething together that's only sufficient to support some
out-of-tree driver with implicit assumptions that we are not aware of is
far from fantastic.

Unfortunately, I think that the area is sufficiently vague that there
simply is no clear and general answer.

For the sake of discussion, an example of a particular block, along with
what you expect/need to describe would be helpful.

Thanks,
Mark.
