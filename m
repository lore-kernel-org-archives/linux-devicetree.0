Yes, it does, only the iio-hwmon bridge is one of those cases where we are now
told that "this describes use, not the hardware itself". But how is one supposed
to describe that an ADC on a board is used as voltage sensor ? Does that mean one
would have to have a dedicated voltage sensor (or current sensor, for that
matter) to ensure that the use case is clear ?

Another example is my recent attempt to add dt support to gpio based connectors.
Even though a connector is as much hardware as it can get (or at least one
should think so), that was rejected because it isn't generic enough and,
after all, it describes the _use_ of gpio pins which apparently is already
borderline. So now I have my own out of tree driver (where I can add as many
bindings and as much functionality as I want and see fit, so I am not too
unhappy about that).

That matches Thierry's earlier comments - one is now _forced_ to maintain
out-of-tree code simply because DT bindings are either unacceptable, not generic
enough, or not stable enough to be accepted into the upstream kernel.

So far I have been able to work around that, but I seriously consider dropping
DT use entirely and moving back to platform data ... not the very least because
DT isn't supported on x86 and I have to deal with that situation as well (and,
no, ACPI doesn't solve my problems there either).

Mission accomplished, at least if the mission is to keep the code out
of the mainstream kernel and limiting DT use cases (or to make it unusable
for practical purposes).
