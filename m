okay, this makes more sense to me. In this case it would be good to have
this new driver in this patch series. So it's possible to verify the
matching binding.

The imx23 dtsi file specifies features on SoC level and i think this
should be kept. We shouldn't implement features for ADC pins without
deeper knowledge about these boards.

Maybe we could introduce a new dtsi file in order to reduce copy &
paste. But at first the OlinuXino should be a good starting point ...
