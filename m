Actually, I've had second thoughts about this, from discussion with Mark
et al.

The extent to which threads share stuff is not really architecturally
visible on ARM.  It will be visible in performance terms (i.e., scheduling
two threads of the same process on threads of on CPU will give better
performance than scheduling threads of different processes), but in
architectural terms still look like fully-fledged, independent CPUs.

I don't know enough about how SMT scheduling currently works in the
kernel to know how best to describe this situation to the kernel...


Anyway, for the ARM case, there is not much architectural difference
between threads within a CPU, and CPUs in a cluster.  At both topological
levels the siblings are independent.  At both levels, there is an advantage
in scheduling related threads topologically close to each other -- though
probably more so for threads in a CPU than CPUs in a cluster.

Also, threads are independent interrupt destinations.  If we want to
put flat lists of SMT threads inside CPU nodes, then we need an
extra means of describing interrupt affinities, different from the
way this is described for CPUs and clusters.  This is definitely
complexity.  I'm not sure if there is a related benefit.

With the arguments above, I'm not sure this is really better than the

If we want to be able to describe affinities and other hardware linkages,
describing the real hardware units as nodes still feels "right".
ePAPR doesn't insist upon how this is done, so we do have choice.

The older/hybrid proposals seem to require different means of describing
linkage depending on whether the target is a topological leaf or not.

I guess the question should be "what advantage is gained from describing
this stuff in the cpus node?"
