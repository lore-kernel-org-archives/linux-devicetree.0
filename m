Hehe :-)

Thanks, I appreciate. I intentionally do some efforts to write detailed
cover letters, especially for the most complicated topics, I believe
it's needed to "sell" the patches to the appropriate maintainers.

Maybe. In any case, the cover letter is never far away for the patch
e-mails, so it isn't that complicated to get back to the cover letter.

Sometimes, it's a bit difficult to decide how to balance the
information between the cover letter and the commit logs. The
explanation in the cover letter has the nice property that it covers
the entire patch series, so it's very convenient to explain the overall
goal of the patch series, the global architecture of the solution being
proposed. But on the other hand, the contents of the cover letter do
not become part of the Git history. On the other side, commit logs
become part of the Git history (so people are more likely to see them
in the future), but are more difficult to use to convey the overall
design, since they are only per-patch.

Let's go for the solution you've chosen: merge PATCH 3/3 of the v4.
This one does not have build dependency on PATCH 1/3, and already
solves most of the problems: MT_UNCACHED mappings for PCI memory
mappings, and avoidance of outer cache sync operations when hardware
I/O coherency is used. The only thing that remains to solve is the PCI
I/O mappings, but they are a lot less frequently used so it is not as
important as the other aspects of the problem. And this aspect can
indeed be solved as a followup patch.

Best regards,

Thomas
