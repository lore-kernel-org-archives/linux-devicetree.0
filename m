All watchdog drivers implementing a system suspend handler stop the watchdo=
g
before suspending the system. I guess if they wouldn't do that, the watchdo=
g
would restart the system while asleep?

Exceptions are:
  - atlas7_wdt, sirfsoc_wdt: these seem to rely on another driver stopping
    the watchdog clock, so it behaves the same as all above,
  - diag288_wdt: this returns -EBUSY when trying to suspend the system
    while the watchdog is enabled, to put the burden of disabling the
    watchdog on the user,
  - ux500_wdt: this seems to use a hardware feature to automatically
    disable the watchdog during suspend.

So only the last one seems to protect against kernel crashes after the
watchdog's suspend method is called...

Note that two drivers (iTCO_wdt and wdat_wdt) implements suspend_noirq
instead of suspend, which decreases the window of running without a watchdo=
g
a bit.

I do welcome that point of view ;-)
