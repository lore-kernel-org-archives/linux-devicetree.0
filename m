I think this name is the only thing I don't like about this patch,
because it is only unstable if the workaround is on. This is a minor
thing and it can be addressed when/after merging it. No need to respin
it on this account.

The usual question is "Who takes it?". I'm quite keen on it, as my
LS2085 is otherwise completely unusable.

Thanks,
