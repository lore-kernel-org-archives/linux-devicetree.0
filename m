Sure.

I don't see why. The datasheets have not been completely written yet
for this particular chip. For other chips we've worked on where we
collaborated with the SoC vendor, we never had any datasheet, simply
because the SoC vendor doesn't have any. They have the digital logic
source code, and then tons of spreadsheets or text documents that are
not proper datasheets and that they generally cannot share with
third-parties.

Hence, even when the support for a SoC is being done in collaboration
with the SoC vendor, we don't always have a nice full datasheet that
tells us what all the registers are doing and how they are organized.
We discover things as we go.

Yes, this might be surprising to you, working at ARM, where the
technical documentation is awesome and very detailed. But trust me,
this is *NOT* what you get from many SoC vendors.

This simply doesn't work. This initial support of a few patches (clock,
basic DT, irqchip, dmaengine) is going to be followed very soon by lots
of other patches to enable more aspects of the SoC. And we should keep
all of those patches out-of-tree, piling up hundreds of out-of-tree
patches ? Not practical at all.

And then when we'll submit them, they will all be accepted in one go,
in one kernel cycle ? Clearly not, so we would have to wait several
kernel cycles, which is clearly not what we want.

Instead, what we want is to submit the basic stuff early, and then
progressively build on top of this basic stuff by merging more and more
features. This way:

 * We don't have to pile up hundreds of out of tree patches;

 * We have a support in the mainline kernel that is progressively
   getting better as we enable more and more feature. We can show that
   4.6 has this small set of features, 4.7 has this slightly extended
   set of features supported, and so on.

So no, we clearly do not want to keep things out of tree.

We are perfectly fine with maintaining *code*. And we have been doing
so for several years on Marvell platforms: caring about older
platforms, converting old legacy code and legacy platforms to the
Device Tree, etc.

What we don't want to commit to is to maintain the DT stability
*before* the support for a given device is sufficiently stable/sane.

Could you please explicit which pain points it creates for others ?

Having unstable DT bindings specific to a platform does not create any
single pain point for anyone.

Why are you talking about "illusion" of support ? Sorry, but with
unstable DT bindings, as long as you use the DT that comes with the
kernel sources, everything works perfectly fine, and is perfectly
supported.

Even Fedora is installing DTBs in a directory that is kernel-version
specific!

Best regards,

Thomas
