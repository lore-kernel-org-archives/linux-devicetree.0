The idea here was to provide compatibility with older OSes not
supporting PSCI 0.2, those would match on the "arm,psci" compatible
string and require the numbers (see bindings/arm/psci.txt).

Thinking again I realise that we require PSCI 0.2 for having reset and
shutdown, so I will drop this and just provide the 0.2 compatible string.

Don't know, can we? I found it nice to have it in here to give people at
the least the idea of where DRAM starts and also making it clear that a
bootloader is expected to patch this (and having a node already makes
patching easier).

Would be happy to adapt to this, but we should sort this approach out
(see the other mail).

You are right in one point: it is not documented. I just see that I
forgot to update the bindings doc and describe this behaviour there.

But I don't see an issue with abstracting the clock provider's internal
details by referring to the parent node and use the DT's natural tree
structure to properly represent these clock gates. I cannot read
anything in clock-bindings.txt that would prevent this.

Happy to hear from DT maintainers about it.

And in your case we would put knowingly invalid information into the kernel?
So what is wrong with just _not_ putting this information until we know
it? With my patch you would just enumerate the gates we know the parents
of so far. Once we learn about the other gates, we add them. If we don't
know the parent, we probably can't use it anyway, I guess.
So we do as we do with other new features: updated DTs provide new
functionality.

And also: this is about A64, not A83t.

But if we have a broken DT out there where a feature never worked or had
bugs, we _can_ fix it. Interested users will upgrade their DT and are
able to use the new feature or run without bugs now. This mimics the
approach when we add features: users update. However if users are happy
with the current feature set or are not affected by the bug, they can
use the older DT.

Also from my point of view it is much harder to provide an updated
kernel to people, since every distribution would need to pick up the
changes and provide updates to their users.

How so?

Speaking of this driver: I really dislike that it hardcodes Soc specific
information into the kernel. I consider this bad style. The clock gates
are a rather generic functionality (one bit per gate), and we provide
the SoC specific part (mapping names and bit numbers) already in the DT.
So with the parent relation in the code we hide some information from
the DT which clearly belongs there, also ending up with having something
in the kernel and something in the DT.
Also this requires to add support for each and every SoC explicitly in
the kernel.

Also please keep in mind that the DT is not just for Linux: why should
other OS developers hard code the same information over and over again
when we could have it once for everybody in the DT?

I think we should stop with supporting each and every SoC explicitly in
the kernel and go for more generic drivers, that use DTs to describe
each SoC.
That way we can eventually reach the point where we have (at least)
basic functionality for a new SoC in existing(!) kernels - like from a
LTS style distribution kernel.
New SoCs would just come with their DTs as part of their firmware, as
it's the case with many arm64 boards out there at the moment. As long as
they don't have fundamentally new IP blocks (for the basic
functionality), that could just work out of the box.

> So please use it.

I really rather would avoid doing this.

I would appreciate if other people could comment on this.
