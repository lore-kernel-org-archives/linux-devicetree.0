Describe the hardware accurately.  If the hardware has outputs called
OUT1 and OUT2 that aren't fixed function in some way then describe them
like that, if the CODEC has routing control just describe the routing
control.

Good.

You can't, do this in your userspace configuration - UCM contains tools
to help do remapping if you are using raw ALSA.  Or extend the in kernel
frameworks but that's probably more trouble than it's worth and it's not
clear it's even a good idea to have the complexity in kernel.

That's really common - the overwhelming majority of CODECs have such a
design if they have multiple outputs.  Could you articulate what's
unclear here?
