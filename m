I believe the "Start Code Detection" feature is referring to the 4 byte start code
found in packetized elementary stream (PES). So it is a A/V optimisation for the
DMA controller.

Yes I believe so.

Ok, I  will implement like this in the next version.

Yes I agree, thanks for your review and comments :)
