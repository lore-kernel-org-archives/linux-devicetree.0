Yes, I think I need to give more details on design choices.

The IP provides 2 channels.
I can see mainly 3 solutions to link dais to these channels:

1) 2 static dais NOT exclusive
	- dai tx
	- dai rx
The IP exhibits a mode register, where you select mode TX, RX or FD.
There are 2 two options to manage this register.
option 1:
	start first channel with mode RX or TX
	when second channel is started, mode has to be changed to FD.
	Transfers have to be stopped before changing configuration
	registers, so this leads to cuts in audio stream.
option 2:
	start a first channel with mode FD.
	In this case, we may have unpredictable behavior for the stream
	which is not already started. probably underrun/overrun.
So, this solution rises problem for full-duplex management.

2) 3 static dais exclusive
	- dai tx
	- dai rx
	- dai rx-tx (fd)
This is the current implementation.
The choice of the dai is done at probe time. It is provided by DT 
through sound-dai parameter.
When dai fd is selected, after starting first stream, we assume that
second stream will be started. In this case we wait for second stream
to be available before enabling IP and starting transfers.

3) 1 dynamic dai
	- dai rx or tx or fd (according to dma conf in IP node)
Here the driver exposes only a single dai constructed from dma 
configuration provided by IP DT node.
This allows to get ride of sound-dai parameter.
This was my suggestion after Rob comments on DT bindings.

Hope this will help clarifying design constraints.
