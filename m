Hello,

I'm jumping into the discussion, but I clearly don't have all the
context of the discussion.

The Armada XP does not have a GIC at all, but only a MPIC as the
primary interrupt controller.

However the Armada 38x has both a GIC and a MPIC, and indeed the parent
interrupts of the MPIC towards the GIC is:

	interrupts = <GIC_PPI 15 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

Best regards,
