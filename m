the asp_chan_q was used with the old davinci_pcm which has been removed a
while ago.

Good question. Since the driver itself does not care about pdata I would
remove it. On the other hand if you implement the FIFO handling you will ne=
ed
pdata for legacy mode to select the FIFO threshold.
Currently there is one pdata structure for legacy mode used by the McASP,
McBSP and the Voice Codec. It contains mixed options applicable for all and
some which applicable only for one of the drivers...
I think if we want to make things clean and neat we would aim to have separ=
ate
pdata for each of the drivers.

I would probably drop the current pdata for McBSP and when I see what data I
need for the driver later I would create one for the McBSP only.
