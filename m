I'd try to provide some additional information here.
(Sry, I'll still use term "events")

As Lokesh explained in other mail on K3 SoC everything is generic and most
of resources allocated dynamicaly:
- generic DMA channels
- generic HW rings (used by DMA channel)
- generic events (assigned to the rings) and muxed to different cores/hosts

So, when some driver would like to perform DMA transaction It's
required to build (configure) DMA channel by allocating different type of
resources and link them together to get finally working Data Movement path
(situation complicated by ti-sci firmware which policies resources between cores/hosts):
- get UDMA channel from available range
- get HW rings and attach them to the UDMA channel
- get event, assign it to the ring and mux it to the core/host through IA->IR-> chain
   (and this step is done by ti_sci_inta_register_event() - no DT as everything is dynamic).

Next, how this is working now - ti_sci_inta_register_event():
- first call does similar things as regular DT irq mapping (end up calling irq_create_fwspec_mapping()
   and builds IRQ chain as below:
   linux_virq = ti_sci_inta_register_event(dev, <ringacc tisci_dev_id>,
				<ringacc id>, 0, IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH, false);

              +---------------------+
              |         IA          |
+--------+   |            +------+ |        +--------+         +------+
| ring 1 +----->evtA+----->VintX +---------->   IR   +--------->  GIC +-->
+--------+   |            +------+ |        +--------+         +------+  Linux IRQ Y
    evtA      |                     |
              |                     |
              +---------------------+

- second call updates only IA input part while keeping other parts of IRQ chain the same
   if valid <linux_virq> passed as input parameter:
   linux_virq = ti_sci_inta_register_event(dev, <ringacc tisci_dev_id>,
				<ringacc id>, linux_virq, IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH, false);
              +---------------------+
              |         IA          |
+--------+   |            +------+ |        +--------+         +------+
| ring 1 +----->evtA+--^-->VintX +---------->   IR   +--------->  GIC +-->
+--------+   |         |  +------+ |        +--------+         +------+  Linux IRQ Y
              |         |           |
+--------+   |         |           |
| ring 2 +----->evtB+--+           |
+--------+   |                     |
              +---------------------+

   As per above, irq-ti-sci-inta and tisci fw creates shared IRQ on HW layer by attaching
   events to already established IA->IR->GIC IRQ chain. Any Rings events will trigger
   Linux IRQ Y line and keep it active until Rings are not empty.

Now why this was done this way?
Note. I'm not saying this is right, but it is the way we've done it as of now. And I hope MSI
will help to move forward, but I'm not very familiar with it.

The consumer of this approach is K3 Networking driver, first of all, and
this approach allows to eliminate runtime overhead in Networking hot path and
provides possibility to implement driver's specific queues/rings handling policies
- like round-robin vs priority.

CPSW networking driver doesn't need to know exact ring generated IRQ - it
need to know if there is packet for processing, so current IRQ handling sequence we have (simplified):
- any ring evt -> IA -> IR -> GIC -> Linux IRQ Y
   handle_fasteoi_irq() -> cpsw_irq_handler -> disable_irq() -> napi_schedule()
   ...
   soft_irq() -> cpsw_poll():
	- [1] for each ring from Hi prio to Low prio
	      [2] get packet
	      [3] if (packet) process packet & goto [2]
	          else goto [1]
	       if (no more packets) goto [4]
	  [4] enable_irq()

As can be seen there is no intermediate IRQ dispatchers on IA/IR levels and no IRQs-per-rings,
and NAPI poll cycle allows to implement driver's specific rings handling policy.

Next: depending on the use case following optimizations are possible:
1) throughput: split all TX (or RX) rings on X groups, where X = num_cpus
and allocate assign IRQ to each group for Networking XPS/RPS/RSS.
For example, CPSW2G has 8 TX channels and so 8 completion rings, 4 CPUs:
  rings[0,1] -(IA/IR) - Linux IRQ 1
  rings[2,3] -(IA/IR) - Linux IRQ 2
  rings[4,5] -(IA/IR) - Linux IRQ 3
  rings[6,7] -(IA/IR) - Linux IRQ 4
each Linux IRQ assigned to separate CPU.

2) min latency:
  Ring X is used by RT application for TX/RX some traffic (using AF_XDP sockets for example)
  Ring X can be assigned with separate IRQ while other rings still grouped to
  produce 1 IRQ
  rings[0,6] - (IA/IR) - Linux IRQ 1
  rings[7] - (IA/IR) - Linux IRQ 2
  Linux IRQ 2 assigned to separate CPU where RT application is running.

Hope above will help to clarify some K3 AM6 IRQ generation questions and
find the way to move forward.

Thanks a lot for you review and comments.
