It's probably worth putting together a description of the constraint and
asking people like Takashi who understand the code - ideally it'd be
easy to implement but I suspect you're right about timescales.

I'm not totally against the idea so it's worth continuing.  Just not
happy either but computer.

It just occurred to me that we may be able to sidestep the issue by
calling them "suggested rates/widths" so the implementation can ignore
them later.  That's a *tiny* bit gross but does sidestep the ABI issues.
