It is useless as a reverse mapping from OF nodes to devices.  It tells us
which device pointing to the given device node has been found first, but
that's just it.

You can't say whether or not it is special in any way with respect to the
other devices hanging out of the same OF node unless you have some additional
information on how those devices are related to each other.

Thanks,
