I think if we are not enforcing any DT bindings by passing compatible
and property names as module parameters then we don't need any
DT bindings document. We can certainly remove default property
names and enforce UIO dmem users to always pass this as module
parameters.

Anyways, you have already NAKed this so I will just get all dynamic
region info from module parameters only.
