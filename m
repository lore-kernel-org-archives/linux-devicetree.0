As we're going to re-spin, it's a good idea to have the KCS and LPC
changes in separate patches. I will take the KCS one straight away,
but the LPC one might need more work (see my comments below).

Are you using this to expose some RAM over LPC? If not, we don't want this here.

It is a flaw in the design of the driver that the reserved memory
region is required. We should change the driver to make it optional.

As a workaround, we could add this patch to the tiogapass device tree
but make it smaller so you're not losing 64MB of RAM.
