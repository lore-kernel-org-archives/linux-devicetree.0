The LDD3 is one of the best there is. A fourth edition is suppose to come out sometime
next year.

For understanding this you need to understand how the platform infrastructure
works and why is it used.
http://lwn.net/Articles/448499/
http://lwn.net/Articles/448502/
and go through some of the relevant drivers.

This should be more clear once you go through LDD3.

This actually depends on the kernel you are using. Do you have relatively
new kernel or an old one? Depending on that, either you will get that
information in a board file or else in the device tree in arch/arm/boot/dts.

This depends. If you have driver compiled in with the kernel this will happen
on kernel boot up. If you have the driver as a loadable module, the probe hook
will be called on modprobe or insmod.

Some practical stuff on there which might be useful to you.
