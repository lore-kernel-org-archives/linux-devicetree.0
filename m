This series adds SMP support for two Broadcom mobile SoC families.
It uses CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE() so that SMP operations are assigned
using device tree rather than adding it to a machine definition in a
board file.

The enable method starts a secondary core by writing to a register
monitored by CPUs spinning in a ROM-based holding pen loop.  The
address of this register is recorded as a property in the "cpus"
node of the device tree.

Notes:
    - I would prefer to document the binding in a separate file in
      the way suggested here:
        https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/5/20/559
      But for now I'm keeping this independent of that.
    - This series is based on v3.15-rc4, plus one more recently-posted patch:
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/4/15/303
    - This series is available here:

	Branch review/bcm-smp-v4

History
v4: - Renamed "platsmp.c" to be "kona_smp.c".
    - Rebased onto v3.15-rc5
v3: - Dropped definition and use of CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE_SETUP()
    - Added documentation for "enable-method"
    - Rebased onto v3.15-rc4
v2: - Fixed a Makefile error (:= should have been +=)
    - No longer set CONFIG_NR_CPUS in bcm_defconfig
    - Rebased onto v3.15-rc1
