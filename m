I will add change log into this section in next version of the patch.

I will remove 'id'.

I will fold these 2 functions into their callers and then get rid of them.

I will remove all the typecast of a void pointer in the driver.

I will relax the MBOX_CNT irqs restriction: Platform can provide less
than MBOX_CNT irqs, which also means less than MBOX_CNT mailbox
channels.
