in connection to previous discussion started here [1] I want to ask your
opinion, does it make sense to support non-DT LPC32xx platforms (by the
way there is no such platforms in vanilla)?

In particular I'd like to remove legacy platform data support and
clean-up mach-lpc32xx, e.g. remove duplicated timer driver etc.

At the moment I've completed development and tested:
* common clock framework driver (no review comments from maintainers so
far),
* irqchip driver (SPARSE_IRQ is supported),
* as a dependency to IRQ changes I developed a wakeup controller driver,
* as a dependency to IRQ changes GPIO driver is rewritten -- at the
moment it strictly depends on hwirq plus its current version breaks
board boot in v4.4, see [2].

In general the platform is broken since commit 76ba59f8366 ("genirq: Add
irq_domain-aware core IRQ handler"), dated Aug 26 2014 (!), because the
platform is based on legacy irq domain and hwirq 0 is actively exploited
-- this is a cascaded irq to one of the sub-irq controllers.

All done work allows to remove thousands of LoCs and make LPC32xx boot
and work again at the price of discontinued legacy DTB to new kernel
compatibility (for example due to missed clocks properties etc.) and
removed platform_data hooks.

I can continue to improve LPC32xx platform, but I believe I need some
kind of approval from ARM maintainers to convince clk/irqchip/gpio
maintainers to accept my work. What would be your opinion on this subject?
