I vote for the latter. IIRC, in the past we already had some discussion
on how to handle version dependent Flexcan hardware, e.g. by using
flexcan-vX.X or being expicit using fsl,p1010-flexcan. Search for "Add
support for powerpc" in the netdev mailing list. I added the
devicetree-discuss ml for that reason.
