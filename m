I won't duplicate Nico's review, but I have a couple of extra comments/
questions, below.

Depending on the power controller, it might be possible for writes to
the controller to be lost or not acted upon, if a previous change is
still pending.

Does this issue apply to the exynos power controller?

If this is the case, it might be necessary to ensure before a power-up
request, that the power controller has caught up and reports the
cluster/CPU as down.  Putting this poll before the write to the
power controller maximises the chance of pipelining useful work
in the meantime.  Putting the poll after the write is the worst case.

Agreed.

The fact that there is no C interface for enabling ACE ports is
deliberate.  For CPUs connected to ACE and managed via MCPM,
it is incorrect to enable CCI via C code, since the safe window
is the window during which all outbound CPUs have reached CLUSTER_DOWN
and all inbound CPUs have not turned their MMU on yet (and thus cannot
execute any general Linux C code).

There might be scenarios involving GPUs and other non-CPU devices
connected to ACE ports where the device cannot enable CCI snoops
for itself -- but this would require a holding-pen protocol to enable
the device to wait and signal a CPU to enable CCI snoops on the device's
behalf before the device proceeds.  It is not the correct solution for
CPU clusters attached to ACE, precisely because we can be more efficient
in that case.

In fact, because you implement a power_up_setup method that calls
cci_enable_port_for_self, CCI snoops are actually enabled twice, making
the above code appear redundant.   Have I missed something?
