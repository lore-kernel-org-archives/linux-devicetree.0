Only if board vendors would start to actually ship things that way.

Note that putting a proper version of uboot / the bootloader on the device
is somewhat orthogonal to the whole DT compatibility discussion, the only
thing the bootloader has to do with the dtb when using extlinux booting
is that it has coded which specific dtb file to load for the board,
currently it loads the actual dtb from ftddir/<name-coded-in-u-boot>.dtb
where ftddir gets set by the extlinux.conf entry. I realize that this
will not work when trying to boot a new board with a kernel which does
not have a dtb for this board, and in this case having some sort of
fallback ftddir with a dtb would be interesting, and yes this would
require stable bindings.

I'm not arguing that stable bindings may not be useful but currently
no-one is doing the above. So currently there is no reason to worry
too much about stability. If someone had shipped such a board I would
certainly be in favor of this series. But currently the stability
problem is a hypothetical problem and I do not think that carrying
extra code to fix a hypothetical problem is a good idea.

Yes seriously, because you're fixing a hypothetical problem. I'm all
for not randomly breaking devicetree compatibility and so far on
sunxi this has only be done 2 or 3 times over the years, but in the
end it is a balancing act between wishing to keep compatibility and
wishing to keep clean code.

As soon as we actually see boards shipping with dtb-s encoded in their
bootloader, then this balancing act stops and dt compatibility will
become a hard requirement, but IMHO for now sometimes it is better to
break compat when this helps to keep things clean.

I think that the conclusion is that most people are ok with the break,
as is, since it is known to not cause any real world problems.

But in the end this is Maxime's call.

p.s.

I love the work you've been doing on the A64, I've not had a chance
to try it out yet though. Have you made any progress with getting
the mmc slot to work ?  If not maybe I can make some time I've
prior experience in bringing up the mmc slot on other Allwinner SoCs
