1. For example,

#define ATMEL_NFC_CMD(pos, cmd)                        ((cmd) <<
(((pos) * 8) + 2))

 *events ^= (status & *events);

 (((x) * 0x4) + 0x28)

  memset(&si[1], 0, sizeof(s16) * ((2 * strength) - 1));

Perhaps more in the code. I'm not a LISP programmer.

2. For empty lines it's solely matter of style, I don't care. My motto
"less LOC better, but keep common sense in mind".

3. I don't remember anymore, sorry. Something I would refactor.

4. First of all, why do you need this function in the first place?

+struct gpio_desc *
+atmel_nand_pdata_get_gpio(struct atmel_nand_controller *nc, int gpioid,
+                         const char *name, bool active_low,
+                         enum gpiod_flags flags)

5. BIT() macro:

   const unsigned int k = 1 << deg(poly);
   unsigned int nn = (1 << mm) - 1;

6. Why this casting (unsigned int) ?

 dev_dbg(pmecc->dev,
                       "Bit flip in %s area, byte %d: 0x%02x -> 0x%02x\n",
                       area, byte, *ptr, (unsigned int)(*ptr ^ BIT(bit)));

7. Question to all that distribution or whatever functions, don't you
have a common helper? Or each vendor requires different logic behind
it?

8. Have you checked what kernel library provides?

And I believe there are still issues like those. After, who is on
topic, might even find some logical and other issues...

P.S. TBH, so big change is unreviewable in meaningful time. To have a
comprehensive review I, for example, spend ~1h/250LOC, and
~2.5h/1000LOC, I would estimate ~4h/2000LOC. Imagine one to spend one
day for this. Any volunteer? Not me.
