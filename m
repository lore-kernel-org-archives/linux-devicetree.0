So let me get this straight.
First of all (though slightly unrelated), I looked at 
drivers/gpio/gpio-generic.c and found no reference whatsoever to the 
of_* infrastructure.
So I realized of_device_alloc() populates the resource table of the 
platform_device automatically -- I wasn't aware of that.

Second of all, if I understand it correctly (guessing the values for 
#size-cells and #address-cells), your translation scheme works as 
follows (let's say for the first register 0x8 of gpio3):

gpio3 (0x8)
-> range 0 of fpga@0       ==> 0x00000000 0x82000000 0x00000000
-> range 0 of pcie@1,0     ==> 0x82000000 0x1 0
-> range 1 of pex@e0000000 ==> MBUS_ID(0x04, 0xe8) 0
-> range 0 of mbus         ==> 0xe0000000

so you end up accessing @0xe0000008, is that right?

Looks like it ends up at the beginning of the memory region for PCIe, 
and that's no wonder since you only have a single device with a single 
BAR... right?

So suppose you also had a bigger BAR1 which would then shift your GPIO 
block at @0xe8000000.
I believe we've established (in other followup mails) it would be nice 
to have a dynamic translation mechanism, which is not in place yet.
Until we get that figured out, where would you hardcode such offset then?
How would you also deal with a second (let's say identical) device on BAR1?
I guess I could live with hardcoded values in the DT, as long as they're 
easy to spot and there's only one per BAR/device.
Then it's easy to do a comparison with whatever gets assigned during 
probing.

(Apologies in advance if I'm talking nonsense, but I only see a bunch of 
numbers in the above tree, I'm having a really hard time figuring out 
how this whole translation works...)

Stupid question... why not the following:

rc = of_platform_populate(root, NULL, NULL, parent);

I've been using this in several places, though I've always wondered 
whether there was indeed something wrong it...

Right, which is my case... except, I have several BARs within it, which 
does complicate things quite a bit, I'm afraid.

Thanks again Jason!
