Some advantages that come to mind are user configurability and
statistics. Perhaps the user wants to know how many single bit errors
(correctable errors in EDAC language) have happened so they can figure
out if the part is going bad. Or perhaps the user wants to panic on
single bit errors to play it safe. The edac framework makes this sort of
thing standard, instead of requiring SoC specific tooling. It also
groups similar pieces of hardware support in one place and gets code out
of mach directories.
