SOC (1/15):
Extracts the kryo l2 accessors driver from the QCOM PMU driver

Clocks (2/15-9/15):
This series adds support for the CPU clocks on msm8996 devices.
The driver uses the existing PLL drivers and is required to control
the CPU frequency scaling on the MSM8996.

Ilia Lin (5):
soc: qcom: Separate kryo l2 accessors from PMU driver
clk: Use devm_ in the register fixed factor clock
clk: qcom: Add CPU clock driver for msm8996
dt-bindings: clk: qcom: Add bindings for CPU clock for msm8996
clk: qcom: Add ACD path to CPU clock driver for msm8996

Rajendra Nayak (3):
clk: qcom: Make clk_alpha_pll_configure available to modules
clk: qcom: cpu-8996: Add support to switch to alternate PLL
clk: qcom: cpu-8996: Add support to switch below 600Mhz
