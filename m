Ok. BTW it seems I might have the opportunity to look into this.

That'd be a very good thing to get mainline well enough that it ships
with it. Given that information it would make sense to get rid of the
comments, which I'll keep in mind for when the ECC issue is sorted out.

Thanks for the review.
