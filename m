If the qspi is supported and you have a high degree of confidence that the
node is correct based on testing on 4.1, I would say keep the node and
mark it as "ok".

If it's not there then it should be disabled, but it should be set to disabled
in the dtsi file (not the dts).

If it's not there on the board, then yes, mark as disabled.

If the board supports it and it's been tested, then yes mark as "okay".
