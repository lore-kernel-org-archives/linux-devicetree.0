I went ahead and implemented in mcasp driver a similar rule to the one 
already found from pcm512x. The rule indeed forbids the sample-rate and 
fame-size combinations that can not be played accurately.

However, once a user tries to play a bad sample-rate and fame-size 
combination, aplay greets him with:

aplay: pcm_params.c:170: snd1_pcm_hw_param_get_min: Assertion 
`!snd_interval_empty(i)' failed.

And even worse, playing to plughw gives the same error. So in practice 
the rule is pretty useless. The user is in the same situation as before: 
His use-case does not work and he has no idea why.

I guess in the long run the ideal solution would making the user-space 
behave better in such a situation, but for now I thing a human selected 
constraints are the only proper way to solve the problem.

Putting the constraints into dts may not be the most elegant choice, so 
I look into adding a new compatible match for each new card and hard 
code the DAI-link configurations for each match in the code instead of dts.

I'll send the rule patch too (as soon as I have it cleaned it up) as it 
does hurt to have it, even if it is not enough to make all the 
configurations properly usable.

Best regards,
Jyri
