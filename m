Yes, this should be just "atmel,at91sam9260-rtt" to follow the current
practise in AT91. However, as I mentioned in an earlier mail one could
interpret

	"The first string in the list specifies the exact device that
	the node represents in the form "<manufacturer>,<model>". The
	following strings represent other devices that the device is
	compatible with.

	For example, the Freescale MPC8349 System on Chip (SoC) has a
	serial device which implements the National Semiconductor
	ns16550 register interface. The compatible property for the
	MPC8349 serial device should therefore be: compatible =
	"fsl,mpc8349-uart", "ns16550". In this case, fsl,mpc8349-uart
	specifies the exact device, and ns16550 states that it is
	register-level compatible with a National Semiconductor 16550
	UART."

	http://www.devicetree.org/Device_Tree_Usage#Understanding_the_compatible_Property

to mean that the compatible property should always be exact SoC-IP
followed by the first (most generic) compatible one.

Yes, this would also work but it just appears to me that it would
violate the above mentioned description of the compatible property:

	"The first string in the list specifies the exact device that
	the node represents in the form "<manufacturer>,<model>". The
	following strings represent other devices that the device is
	compatible with."
