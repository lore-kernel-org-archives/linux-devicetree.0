My first idea would be to call it immediately after registering all
devices and drivers. It looks like it's only needed to make all
devm_ allocations persistent by removing them from the list,
so we have to call early_platform_cleanup() before getting
to the real platform code, but it could be done much earlier
if we want to, at least after both setup_arch() and sh_late_time_init()
are complete.

I think we first need to define what we really want to achieve here.
It sounds like you still want to recreate a lot of what early_platform
devices do, but it seems more important to me to add the missing
functionality to the OF_DECLARE infrastructure. The most
important pieces that seem to be missing are solved by finding
a way to provide a platform_device pointer with the following
properties:

- allow being passed into dev_print()
- allow using the pointer as a token for devres unwinding
- access to device_private data that remains persistent
  until real a platform_driver gets loaded

That can probably be done as an extension to the current
infrastructure.

However, I'd be very cautious about the resource portion:
filling the platform resources (registers, irqs, ...) the way
we do for regular devices is much harder and can introduce
additional (or circular) dependencies on other devices.
OTOH, not using those resources means you have a hard
time passing information from board files.
