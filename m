If you want to align those voltages to something then it's definitely
the SoC range you want to use. This is how the constraints are
specified in the DT binding, as being the allowed voltage range that
won't damage any of the attached consumers.

Please align the constraints to the operating ranges, as specified in
the datasheet. For example an excerpt from the i.MX6SL datasheet:

"4.3.2.1 Regulators for Analog Modules
  LDO_1P1
   [...] Typical Programming Operating Range is 1.0 V to 1.2 V with the
nominal default setting as 1.1 V"

So the range for 1p1 LDO on i.MX6SL should be 1.0V to 1.2V, which is
the same as i.MX6QDL.

Regards,
Lucas
