OK, I checked and udev wants to have both N and T but they can be left
empty. If there are no objections the modalias will look like this:

[root@mnw01 ~]# cat /sys/bus/spi/devices/spi-PRP0001\:00/modalias 
of:Nat25TCatmel,at25

In other words name is the ACPI device name (AT25) in lower case, T is
left empty and C is the compatible property.
