iirc, it was 7, and when git saw a collision, it stepped out to eight.
eg during a git log --oneline.

This is where the logic is flawed.  Hypothetically, 5 years later,
652ed95d5fa6 is no longer unique, but the patch subject line *is* unique
among the set that matches 652ed95d5fa6.

If there were a full sha1 collision between two different, legitimate
patches, they would still have different subject lines.  Since the Fixes
tag works in the event of either sort of collision (12, full), may as
well use 12.

Not to mention, since there are no collisions yet, you can be reasonably
certain that of the two commits matching 652ed95d5fa6, it's the one
that came before the commit containing the Fixes tag. :)

thx,

Jason.
