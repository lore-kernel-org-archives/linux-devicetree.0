Hi Mark,
no power, now that would be nice! :)  What this was supposed to mean is
that the properties are optional, the power of course is not. The DT has
really no control over how I wire up my HW and I'd argue most folks just
permanently power the TAS5720 since the shutdown current is just a few
uAs IIRC in order to save some BOM cost. But I suppose the DT description
is such that the Kernel can more intelligently handle things based on
what the driver is doing if somebody choses and implements additional
regulator/power switch HW. Or did I misunderstand your point?

Thanks,
Andreas
