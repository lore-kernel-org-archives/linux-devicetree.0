Yes, you are right for of_match_node(), I should protect it from non
CONFIG_OF configuration.
Maybe we should provide an empty of_match_node() function in of.h...

Well, of_match_ptr() macro is included in devicetree/next git tree and
will go to mainline during next merge window. It is the desired way to
specify a match table pointer for device tree enabled drivers...

Here is the commit ID in linux-next:
3a1e362e3f3cd571b3974b8d44b8e358ec7a098c

I have a serial driver conversion to device tree sitting in Greg's tty
tree with same functions used. It is also scheduled for inclusion in
next merge 3.2 merge window.

So, I will submit a new v5 revision with of_match_node() only called
when device tree is actually selected. But I will keep the
of_match_ptr() macro. Does it sound ok to you? Or maybe just a little
patch that you can fold into the current one is the best?

Thanks, best regards,
