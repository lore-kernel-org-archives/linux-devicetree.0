There is no periodic PCI meeting, and I don't have any formal future
planning.  We had PCI microconferences at the last couple Linux
Plumbers conferences, but we didn't plan one for this year because it
has been hard to get topic proposals (and I'm not going to be in
D=C3=BCsseldorf).

I would attend an IRC or hangout meeting, of course.  For myself, I
think it would be most useful if it were to follow up on
previously-posted patches, so I'd have a chance to look them over
first, and then have the opportunity in a meeting to talk in more
detail.  If a meeting is a forum for abstract thinking about what we
might do, it's hard for me to respond meaningfully in real time
because I need time to research and explore things.
