Two quick comments before I read Mark=92s comments.

1. Its not normal practice to put something into a DT that does not exi=
st.  Having a node, but marking it disabled implies existence.
2. How would one normally address the audio DSP if it did exist.  I=92m=
 just wondering if having a subnode is the proper solution vs maybe a p=
handle
