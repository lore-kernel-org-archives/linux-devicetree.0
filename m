It's true that they use it less nowadays, but they still do,
ie. https://github.com/allwinner-zh/linux-3.4-sunxi/blob/master/drivers/clk/sunxi/clk-sun8iw7.c#L513

And we have to remain consistent anyway.

The display engine definitely has an endpoint: the TCON.

I'm still not sure how it would complexify anything, and why you can't
use the display graph to model the relation between the display engine
and the TCON (and why you want to use a generic property that refers
to the of-graph while it really isn't).

If it's the frame sent to the encoder, then it would be the CRTC by
DRM's nomenclature.

That's very valuable (and definitely should go into a comment),
thanks!

I still believe that's it should be into a (simple at first)
atomic_check. That would be easier to extend and quite easy to
document and get simply by looking at the code.

Ah, yes, my bad. I thought you were registering a device and a
driver. Still this is a very unusual pattern. Why do you need to split
the two? Can't you just merge them?

It's not really for free, it costs you a generic plane that could
definitely be used for something else and cannot anymore because
they've been hardcoded to a cursor.

And having a camera, the VPU or even an application directly output
directly into one of these planes seems a much better use of a generic
plane than a cursor.
