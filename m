No. The interrupt schema isn't mandatory unless the Tegra I2C schema
actively opts in to interrupt usage.

There isn't /an/ interrupt schema, there's a framework for interrupt
schemas, where the specific "final" schema parameterizes the interrupt
schema. It's impossible to fully evaluate whether an interrupts
property conforms to the requirements unless you evaluate it in the
context of a particular "final" schema.

Also, while it would be silly, I've never seen a rule specifically
stated that common properties such as interrupts, reg, *-gpios,
*-supply, pinctrl-* are absolutely reserved for their typical meaning,
and that no binding can ever use them for other local purposes. It
would make sense to explicitly state this though.

In practical terms, what this means is that, without any knowledge of
the final binding, you can check that an interrupts property conforms
to some general rules such as: it's a list of phandle + specifier, and
the specifier length must match the interrupt parent, and the number
of entries in interrupts an interrupt-names (if present) must match.

However, you can't check any of the following without specific
knowledge of the final binding:

* Some bindings don't use interrupts, and hence
interrupts/interrupt-names/interrupt-parent must /not/ be present in
the node.

* The specific (range of) number of entries that must be present in
interrupts.

* The specific set of entries that must exist in interrupt-names.

* Any ordering requirements on the names in interrupt-names (say the
binding was first defined to use interrupts by index, then later
extended to look up additional entries by name via interrupt-names).

I don't think it makes sense to check the base interrupts syntax
alone, then those other rules later. Instead, it makes sense to check
all the interrupt-related rules at once, when you have enough
knowledge of all the requirements.

Also, interrupts is an easy case because the property name is static.
What about GPIOs or regulators. Do the base GPIO/regulator schema
checkers search for all properties name *-gpios and *-supply and check
those? How would one avoid collisions with other bindings that happen
to use those same property names. Explicitly disallowing property name
collisions for single property names like interrupts seems reasonable.
Disallowing whole patterns of property names seems a bit harder, and
less reasonable.

A big issue here is that if a node actually has an interrupts
property, but the final schema says it shouldn't, the only way to
check for that is for every schema that doesn't use interrupts to
specifically check that no interrupts property is present. That
explicit negative check has to be added for every common/generic/base
schema. That doesn't seem scalable.

Going back to the GPIOs/regulators case, if a base GPIO/regulator
schema has "blessed" property xxx-gpios as being OK, how does the
final schema for a node undo that; must it explicitly enumerate every
property that's present in the node and check it against the list of
valid properties? I had envisaged something more like:

for each node:
    mark each property as invalid
    run all the schema checks
      (marking properties as valid as they're checked)
    for all properties in node:
        if property is not marked valid, error out

If we run the various schema checkers at unrelated times, because
they're separate checks, then we end up with either:

for each node:
    run lots of sub-checkers
    mark each property as invalid
    run just the final schema checker
      (marking properties as valid as they're checked)
    for all properties in node:
        if property is not marked valid, error out

I don't like the special case for the final checker there.

If the schema checkers start to run on the same node in parallel, or
in any undefined order, then things start getting worse.

interrupts is a bit special here because there's historically only
been one parent. However, not all "base" schemas have this benefit,
and even with interrupts, the interrupts-extend property breaks this
assumption. This means that n different "parent" (provider/supplier)
nodes end up defining the format of a single property in a consumer
node, which feels a bit messy. Having a single "check the entire
interrupts property" function/schema, which goes and gets a little
information from the provider/supplier (i.e. #interrupt-cells) feels a
lot cleaner.

True. It sounds like we want a schema checker for the schemas, so that
schema X can't (re-)define a property that schema Y defines the global
meaning of!

Surely we want to deal with everything in a uniform way though, rather
than having some techniques that work for interrupts, and a different
set of techniques that work for GPIOs.
