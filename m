You're right, it should reference its power supply which should be a
fixed regulator controlled via GPIO from AXP803.

Unfortunately there's no AXP803 GPIO support yet and
simple-audio-amplifier doesn't have regulator property.

I have no time (and interest) to work on it in near future, so if
anyone wants to pick it up - feel free to do so.

Vasily
