Agree with you, DT update is needed as soon as a clock configuration 
should be changed. This is due to STiH clock driver design based on DT 
description of SoC clock tree.

This clock driver was accepted 2 years ago. At the time being there was 
discussion about clock tree description location: driver or DT.
Bad choice was done for this driver...

If we decide to redesign STiH clock driver using in-driver clock tree 
description, this will modify STiH clock DT nodes description and so 
break DT backward compatibility.

What's from your pov the best option?
