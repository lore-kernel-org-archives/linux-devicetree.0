What's the vendor prefix to use then?  The same thought did occur to me
but I wasn't sure what to suggest instead.

I do think it's reasonable to define a name for display purposes however
this binding doesn't say that, I did say something to that effect
already IIRC.

I didn't query this myself since my expecation with this is that the
rest of the wire format properties will come from the binding that pulls
this together into a card (since this will need to be set at that level
for other CODECs which are more flexible) so I saw this as providing
additional information which would normally not be fixed at that level.
Arguably this could be pushed up there too, though it's not normal to
fix the word size.

We should really be defining things like signed and unsigned as well as
the bits per word since they do make a difference, though in practice
you very rarely see anything except unsigned and some of the formats
listed don't seem to have ever even been used in Linux.
