Not actually. The UEFI spec does define how to pass ACPI, but it can
boot the system without any ACPI at all. Merging UEFI support should
pretty much be a non-issue.

We are pushing a lot of boundaries and doing things on ACPI that have
never been done before. SPI, GPIOs, Clocks, Regulators, composite
devices, key-value properties. All brand new territory, and the Linux
world is driving a lot of it.

Personally, I think the issue of ACPI support should be taken on a
patch-by-patch basis. A lot of the things that need to be done are quite
discrete and fairly well contained. If the patches don't look that way
then push back on them. For the parts that look ready, go ahead and
merge it. Push back on the ones that don't.
