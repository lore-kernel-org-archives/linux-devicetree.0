I have added oc-active-high and I get different results, but it is still 
not quite right. When I short the VBUS, I can see that my overcurrent 
gpio changes state. However, the driver does not turn of the VBUS. When 
I remove the short, I get an overcurrent error in the kernel log. I 
would expect this when I create the short, not when I remove it. I also 
tried adding  GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW to the oc-gpio, but this did not change 
the behavior. In either case, the oc_gpio shows as high under normal 
conditions, so perhaps there is a problem with the gpio-davinci driver 
not picking up GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW from the device tree.


My regulator is basically the same. My device just uses different gpios.

	vbus_reg: vbus-reg {
		compatible = "regulator-fixed";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&usb11_pins>;
		gpio = <&gpio 101 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		oc-gpio = <&gpio 99 0>;
		enable-active-high;
		oc-active-high;
		regulator-name = "vbus";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <5000000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <5000000>;
	}


It seems to me though that I should not have oc-active-high since under 
normal conditions, the oc_gpio is high and during an overcurrent event, 
the oc_gpio is low. Double-checking the behavior without oc-active-high, 
I see that the vbus gpio is turned off in response to the overcurrent 
event, but I don't get the overcurrent message in the kernel log. 
Perhaps this is because as soon as there is an overcurrent event the 
vbus turns off and the oc_gpio returns to normal before the usb driver 
has a chance to poll the overcurrent state?

Also, unplugging the device and plugging it back in does nothing. 
Unbinding and binding the driver does work, but that does not seem like 
a very nice way to have to recover from an overcurrent event.
