As Lars mentions below, we shouldn't have bindings for ASoC; we should
have bindings that describe the HW. Bindings are supposed to be
OS-agnostic, whereas "ASoC" is Linux-specific.

Mark has made the argument that (at least for CODEC analog pins) we can
simply put those strings into the binding document, and make them as
much a part of the binding as anything else. After all, (at least for
CODEC analog pins) the values are simply the names of the pins on the
package, as listed by the HW documentation itself.

We could presumably do the same thing for DAIs; in DT, use a
string-based DAI name derived directly from the HW documentation, rather
than the current intra-ASoC DAI name strings.

That said, I will admit that I personally don't really like the idea of
using strings in bindings. That opinion certainly isn't universal though.

That restriction seems reasonable for a *simple* DT sound binding. For
more complex cards, one could presumably create more complex bindings,
be they generic bindings that cover arbitrary more complex cases, or
bindings for specific configurations that happen to include multiple DAIs.
