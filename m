It turns out I slightly misunderstood Rob's concern.  The issue
is not that the use of the C language preprocessor is discouraged
or frouned upon, but instead that obfuscating invariant data or
spilling random parts of the information across the place in
unneeded ways is unwanted.  While there is agreement that the use
of symbolic identifiers can help readability and maintainability
in certain situations.

Regarding your specific reply:  I haven't noticed before that all
of the macros I cited do expand to a single cell.  Before that I
saw the potential to generate more cells when required for a
single value (like "wide" addresses, or multi cell pins or
channels or whatever).  Can't tell how much of a concern there is
against such an approach, don't have strong feelings about it.

Actually I wasn't picking at those specific macros above, quite
the contrary.  Those were the first I came across searching for
demonstration of useful preprocessor use. :)  I just did not
bother to cite several hundred other useful phrases as well.
