Got it. Thanks for the kindly remind. There's only one dependency:
"arm64: Split out platform options to separate Kconfig" from Olof.

I'd like to learn more to avoid future inconvenience. This means it's better
to rebase on 4.2-rc, right?

Another question is: could patches be based on arm-soc tree if necessary?
for example: if I need the "arm64: Split out platform options to separate
Kconfig" commit.

Thanks a lot,
