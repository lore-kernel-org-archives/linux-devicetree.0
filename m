Isn't this document only for the gpios? I think you're talking about the
MPPs, which also exist on these generation of pmics. We should probably
avoid mixing the two (gpios and mpps) in one binding because they're
really different hardware.

Overloading output-high to choose the MPP mode doesn't seem to follow
the generic pinconfig binding. Does output-high even take a value? Why
can't we use the function property?

Ah, I was looking in the binding document. It looks like the code
comment around PIN_CONFIG_POWER_SOURCE says custom format. It's
concerning though. From what I can tell commit 5b81d55c4ccf (pinctrl:
remove bindings for pinconf options needing more thought, 2013-06-25)
removed this option along with slew-rate because they specifically
didn't have any units associated with them. But then slew-rate came back
in commit 8ba3f4d00078 (pinctrl: Adds slew-rate, input-enable/disable,
2013-12-11) even though it didn't have units and then power-source came
back without units too. Linus, what's going on?
