The HIDMA channel driver resets the channel before using it. That's why, I never
bothered with writing a reset driver on the hypervisor.

You are right. I missed that part. I'll update the device-tree binding documentation.

The QEMU driver has not been posted yet. As far as I know, it just discovers the memory
resources on the platform object and creates mappings for the guest machine only. 

Shanker Donthineni and Vikram Sethi will post the QEMU patch later.
