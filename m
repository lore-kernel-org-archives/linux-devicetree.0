I think we are making simple eeprom framework too smart which will break 
in future.

IMHO, Anything on top of eeprom interface that interprets the data 
should not go into the eeprom framework itself, it can either live some 
parsers/SOC specific drivers/interfaces.

As Stephen pointed out earlier lets start with something like this, 
which would provide a better abstraction to the discussed use cases like 
serial-number and packed data in eeprom.

    qfprom@1000000 {
       reg = <0x1000000 0x1000>;
       ranges = <0 0x1000000 0x1000>;
       compatible = "qcom,qfprom-msm8960"

       pvs-data: pvs-data@40 {
             compatible = "qcom,pvs-a";
             reg = <0x40 0x20>,
       };

        tsens-data: tmdata@10 {
             reg = <0x10 40>;
       };

       serial-number: serial@50 {
             compatible = "qcom,serial-msm8960";
             reg = <0x50 4>, <0x60 4>;
       };

    };

and then on the consumer side:

	device {
		eeproms = <&serial-number>;
		eeprom-names = "soc-rev-id";
	};
	
driver side:

	eeprom_get_cell()
	eeprom_read();
