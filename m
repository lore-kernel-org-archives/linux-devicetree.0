As said, they are already in the tree itself. And they are already 
included in the graph (these are the black edges), so they just don't 
appear in the property dependencies.

Thanks.

What's still questionable about the patches for dtc is if dependencies 
to devices and not just drivers should be included in the new property 
dependencies too. My current assumption is that all devices belonging to 
one and the same driver don't have dependencies between each other. In 
other words the order in which devices will be attached to one and the 
same driver isn't important. If that assumption is correct it would be 
possible to just attach all devices belonging to a driver after the 
driver was loaded (also I haven't that done in my patches).

And thinking about that again, I think I was wrong and doing so have 
been some kind of evil premature optimization I did in order to spare a 
few dependencies/edges. But changing this can done by removing a few 
lines in the code for dtc (patch 1).
