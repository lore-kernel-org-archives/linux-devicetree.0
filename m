This series adds a regulator driver for the Resource Power Manager found in
Qualcomm 8660, 8960 and 8064 based devices.

The RPM driver exposes resources to its child devices, that can be accessed to
implement drivers for the regulators, clocks and bus frequency control that's
owned by the RPM in these devices.

Changes since v2:
  - Fix copy-paste error in dt binding
  - Correct incomplete move from mfd to soc
  - Correct const mistake in regulator driver

Changes since v1:
  - Moved rpm driver to drivers/soc
  - Extracted resource table structs from rpm struct, as per Srinivas request
  - Dropped mode setting support for the regulators for now. Unsure if we need
    it and it requires some rework from the codeaurora solution.
  - Using set_voltage_sel instead of rolling my own "snapping", as per Marks
    request
  - Split regulator ops in mV, uV and swtich versions as per Marks request.
  - Added devicetree property to enable pull down.
