This is really easy if you do what other people have done and provide
the detected voice as a compressed stream.  On the other hand if there's
no stream and people just pick the audio out of the normal record path
is there any great reason why people would configure this at all.

Yes, or the machine driver.

They do less than you might think unfortunately and are more complicated
to reason about so unless you're getting a useful performance gain from
them they're rarely worth the effort.
