Is there expectation that DTB flashed onto the system would define nodes to
bind with both LPASS-based driver and DSP-based driver? I hope not as we want
to keep LPASS-based driver & DSP-based driver mutually exclusive.

Put aside IPQ8064, I would say it is actually more of build time policy
decision for QC SoCs with DSP. XPU is programmed by trust zone to allow certain
LPASS registers to be accessed by the chosen processor. If ADSP and app
processor would have to have access to audio interfaces and DMA, resources
partition(i.e # of DMAs go to ADSP while rest of DMA go to app processor is
decided after analyzing expected concurrency use case. For case of 8016, MDSP
would simply expect it has access to all audio subsystem except digital core of
CODEC.
