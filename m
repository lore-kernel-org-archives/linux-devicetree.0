I think the vdd-levels were an oversight.  The voltages definitely
need to be correct.  As for the corner regulators, I believe the CPR
driver was supposed to address this.  The USB requests a specific
voltage and frequency and based on this the CPR would set the corner
for the regulator.

Stephen, correct me if i am wrong.
