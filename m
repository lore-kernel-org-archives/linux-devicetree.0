ZynqMP serial input output unit (SIOU) is a high-speed serial interface block
that acts as a phy interface for the PCIe, USB 3.0, DisplayPort, SATA, and
Ethernet controllers. These controllers use any one among the available four
multigigabit transceivers for high-speed communication with their link partners
outside the SOC

ZynqMP SIOU supports multiple protocols working at different reference clock
frequencies to operate simultaneously. Each of the four lanes will be having
a dedicated PLL associated which generates the desired frequency required by
the protocol configured based on the reference clock input given. Using this
driver, user can select the desired reference clock frequency for each of
lane 0, lane 1, lane 2, and lane 3 respectively. Each lane can be programmed
to have its own reference clock or can share reference clock from its
neighboring lane, this is called as "Clock Sharing". This driver supports
clock sharing aswell.

These set of patches add support SIOU support by adding zynqmp-phy driver to
linux.

Changes in v2:
	1. Fixed the compilation error when compiled phy-zynqmp.c as a module
	2. Added CONFIG_PM macro in phy-zynqmp.c driver
