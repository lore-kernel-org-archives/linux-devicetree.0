Are you talking about drivers or clk binding documentation ?
In either cases they're not defined :-), but I'd like to know which 
file(s) I
should update.

I'd rather not change the static clock lookup tables, but if you prefer this
approach (and Nicolas agrees), I'll propose a series modifying the drivers
and clk lookup table.

Whatever solution is choosen, I guess I'll have to update the drivers dt
binding documentation anyway ;-).

Boris
