This patchset adds support for the Krait L1/L2 cache error detection
hardware. The first patch fixes a generic framework bug. The next
two patches lay the groundwork for this driver to be added by 
exporting percpu irq functions as well as adding the Krait l2 indirection
register code. The next two patches add the driver and the binding and 
the final patch hooks it all up by adding the device tree node.

I'm not sure which tree this is supposed to go through. Ideally we could
send the first 3 plus the 5th one through an edac tree. The final dts changes
could go through arm-soc via davidb's tree and the Documentation patch could
go through the devicetree tree.

Changes since v2:
 * Picked up acks
 * s/an/a/ in DT binding

Changes since v1:
 * Moved binding into cpus node
 * Picked up acks on first two patches
 * Commented krait l2 accessor functions
