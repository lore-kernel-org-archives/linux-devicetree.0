Do you think it is acceptable to use above ways(adding more board dts) to fix this issue?

I tried the uboot way with fdt command to change the node status, it can work.
However, it seems using fdt command is much complicated than the way i did with kernel
command line and it also does not support enable/disable multi nodes at the same time.
e.g, in order to enable ecspi1 and uart3 and disable gpmi:
with uboot fdt command:
U-Boot > fdt addr ${dtbaddr}
U-Boot > fdt set /soc/aips-bus@02000000/spba-bus@02000000/ecspi@02008000 status "okay"
U-Boot > fdt set /soc/aips-bus@02100000/serial@021e8000 status "okay"
U-Boot > fdt set /soc/gpmi-nand@00112000 status "disabled"
with kernel cmdline:
fdt.enable=ecspi@02008000,serial@021e8000 fdt.disable=gpmi-nand@00112000
So from the using perspective, kernel command line is much more simple and easy than uboot.

If we can not accept adding this feature in kernel, we may would rather using add
more board dts to fix the issue since comparing to kernel command line, adding board
dts only brings a lot of more dts files overhead but the using is as simple as kernel
command line.

Since there are already some places changing node properties in kernel,
i still wonder if we can consider this one as a exceptional too to provide
such feature to user space since it is useful.

Do you have any suggestions on this issue?
It has the similar situation and looks may still need to update nodes status,
either let kernel to provide hook to change node status or in mach code
to update it before populating platform devices.
Or we still do it in u-boot?
