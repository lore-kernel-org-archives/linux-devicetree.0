We could use a non-DT configuration right? From the driver logic,
DT just registers a device corresponding to the machine driver so
that it can probe(). We could register one in fsl_audmix instead.
Please refer to how fsl_ssi registers the sound card device. The
machine driver can get audmix_np from the parent device pointer,
and I think that's all you need.

Or maybe someone else would provide a better way. But it'd work.
