yes earlycon support is already in the kernel.

btw: I found that only stdout-path has different behavior
compare to console=ttyPS0,115200 passed via bootargs.
But I have to look at details to be accurate.

I can fix it when it is needed.

ATF.

yep.

cpu shutdown is working fine with the current firmware.
I didn't try anything else.

We are not require migrate and we don't need to keep CPU online now.
Migrate should return -1.

Fair enough - will add it there.

I believe so. :-)

why is it odd? Is value too high?
It is exactly what we need to get to get i2c working.

I was checking that and hopefully I didn't miss anything.
