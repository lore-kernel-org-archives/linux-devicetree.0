Initially I had this in pcm driver, but looking at example usage of 
snd_dma_alloc_pages, most of them use card->dev and some of them use pcm 
device for allocating dma memory.

Also, as I moved most dsp static services and dais out of DT, except 
codec and sound card, sound card device was the only choice I had for 
binding with iommu and enforcing iova range restrictions.

This call will be replaced by dma-ranges property in DT either way.
