Hi Matt,

thank you for your comments.

imx_src_reset_module, then? Also, I'll add the struct
reset_controller_dev pointer as an argument next time:

static int imx_src_reset_module(struct reset_controller_dev *rcdev,
                unsigned long sw_reset_idx)

Yes, maybe the module reset part of the SRC should be implemented as a
proper device driver in drivers/reset. Then we could use the interrupt
functionality and WARN_ON(timeout), as you suggest.
