I just wanted to confirm that you're talking about multiple audio
functions here (e.g. mic+headphones), rather than mixing audio with
other features (e.g. s-video + line out). I don't think the latter has
any kind of representation in the kernel right now though? That said,
it might be a good idea to represent jacks outside any audio complex
DT node, so that they could host functionality of different types if
the HW does so...
