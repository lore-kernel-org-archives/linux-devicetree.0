With the check above we could return true incorrectly after the first
time we return true. Consider adding the following in order to an empty
desc:

	flags = IRQF_SHARED		// safe, returns true
	flags = IRQF_NO_SUSPEND		// unsafe, returns false
	flags = IRQF_NO_SUSPEND		// unsafe, but returns true

Currently it shouldn't matter as the only caller is a WARN_ON_ONCE(),
but it seems unfortunate to allow this.

We'd also run the loop until we had at least two IRQF_NO_SUSPEND
irqactions:

	flags = IRQF_SHARED_TIMER_OK	// early return
	flags = IRQF_NO_SUSPEND		// run loop
	flags = IRQF_SHARED_TIMER_OK	// run loop
	flags = IRQF_SHARED_TIMER_OK	// run loop
	flags = IRQF_SHARED_TIMER_OK	// run loop
	flags = IRQF_NO_SUSPEND		// don't run loop.
	flags = IRQF_SHARED_TIMER_OK	// don't run loop

I assume that we only have one IRQF_NO_SUSPEND action sharing the line
anyway in your case?

Given that we'll only bother to run the test if there's a mismatch
between desc->no_suspend_depth and desc->nr_actions, I don't think we
win much. These cases should be rare in practice, the tests only
performed when we request the irq, and there shouldn't be that many
actions to loop over.

Thanks,
Mark.
