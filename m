Hi Jacopo,

Thanks for you feedback!

I'm not sure how the below comments apply to [3/5]? I guess you are
suggesting that [3/5] should be dropped?

Yes, I'm pretty sure. In my case, it has to be specified manually
*somewhere* (at least I think it has to, but what do I know?). The
bridge is the best position, if you ask me.

In my case this is not possible, the bridge supports maximum rgb888
input, but since it cannot know how much of that is actually wired,
the actual format needs to be provided manually somewhere. In my
case, I know that I want to send rgb565 to the bridge. Sure, the
wiring between the encoder and the bridge chip could be seen as
another "bridge" that goes from rgb565 to rgb888, but adding some
extra layer to the model for this step seems like over-engineering
to me. Especially when the binding for the generic lvds-transmitter
bridge needs to specify the input format anyway. At least, that's
the right thing to do if you ask me. How else should it know what
format to request?

No, the lvds-transmitter accepts parallel input and spits out lvds,
just like the specific chip I'm using. I do not *need* to specify the
specific chip, and the driver does nothing special for it. It is just
good practice to specify the details when they are readily available.

I think you are.

Cheers,
