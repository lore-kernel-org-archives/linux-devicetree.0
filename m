This helps but none of the kernel doc you added, makes this clear so
perhaps you want to add this info to make that clear for reviewers
as well as for future reference.

Now regarding the events, no matter how they are routed/processed
within SOC, they are essentially interrupts so I do agree with
Marc's other comment.

Thanks for explanation again !!
