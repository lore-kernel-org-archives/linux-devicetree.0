I'll add more description.

OK. Let me work on this. I tried to capture as much documentation as possible
into the series before. One reviewer said I should add it. Another reviewer said I should 
remove it. 

Where would be the best place to document the use case? 
- In the source file?
- In the commit message?
- In the device-tree documentation?

I'll try to write up something based on your and Mark Zyngier's questions for the 
next release.

I hope so too. I'm going towards V20 with small nitpicks rather than the good 
feedback like yours.
