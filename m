Okay, do I understand you correctly, it is possible to configure each
interrupt source which interrupt shall be triggered?

The driver does not enforce pinctrl, but you will probably have non
functional CAN, then :). So leave it as required.

Thanks for the explanation.

I was just thinking about somethink like this:

static inline u32 m_can_fifo_read(const struct m_can_priv *priv priv,
                                  u32 fgi, unsgined int offset)
{
	return m_can_read(priv, priv->mram_base + priv->rxf0_off +
                          fgi * RXF0_ELEMENT_SIZE + offset)
}

Regarding the mram and the offsets:

> 	fifo_addr =3D priv->mram_base + priv->rxf0_off + fgi * RXF0_ELEMENT_SI=
ZE;
> 	fifo_addr =3D priv->mram_base + priv->mram_off + priv->txb_off;

Why is rxf0_off used without the mram_off and txb_off with the mram_off?
Can you please test your driver with a mram offset !=3D in your DT.

If I understand the code in m_can_of_parse_mram() correctly the
individual *_off are already offsets to the *mram_base, so mram_off
should not be used within the driver. I even think mram_off should be
removed from the priv. Do the *_off and *_elems fit into a u8 or u16? If
so it makes sense to convert the priv accordingly.

What about putting the offset and the number of elements into a struct
and make use an array for rxf{0,1}?

The lost message interrupt should always be enabled and reported via a
CAN error message.
