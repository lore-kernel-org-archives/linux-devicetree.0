The concern here is that the device tree you're writing here is clearly
just a direct translation of the particular stuff Linux happens to use
internally into device tree; this is similar to the thing with using
hwmod in the device tree representation and omitting basic stuff like
the register ranges.

This binding doesn't do anything to move towards that goal given that
the only information it includes about the contents of the chip is the=20
name.  Writing the name out in separate CODEC and vibra nodes really
isn't going to accomplish much to promote reuse that can't trivially be
achieved by parsing the name in the MFD driver.

If the binding were doing things like describing the internals of the
device in a way that meant the driver didn't need to know that this was
a twl6040 in particular this sort of thinking is useful but the binding
we have here just isn't doing that at all.

Especially for the CODEC it's not really an IP in itself, it's an
assembly of large numbers of other IPs - digital audio interfaces,
analogue amps and whatnot.  Like I say if the device tree described
this assembly it'd be different but it's really not doing that.

This is precisely my point, what we're being presented with here is a
device tree description of the particular way that Linux wants to
understand this stuff rather than something that lets us learn about the
chip internals.
