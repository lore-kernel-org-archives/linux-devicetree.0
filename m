It's acceptable to me that different silicons are queued in different stages.
I only request that it won't break the compiler building & bootup.

But I think that the pxa clock driver may be shared among all PXA silicons
except for the clock table. What's your opinion?

Converting them into new clock driver may not rely on the reference manual.

We can request others to help testing in the mailing list.
