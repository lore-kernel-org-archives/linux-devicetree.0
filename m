I think that above doesn't quite capture the situation:

Some DMA masters can be cache-coherent (only) with Outer Shareable
transactions. That is a property we could capture inthe DT (e.g.
dma-outer-coherent), and is independent of the kernel configuration.

Whether or not the devices are coherent with the kernel's chosen memory
attributes certainly depends on the kernel configuration, but that is
not what we capture in the DT.

I wasn't able to spot if/where that was enforced. Is it possible to boot
Keystone UP, !LPAE?

Similarly this has not been enforced either way. Currently I cannot see
how devices with dma-coherent could possibly work with Keystone.

I think we also need to be clear as to what we mean by "keystone is
coherent". With LPAE, CPUs can be coherent with each other, so long as
the appropriate physical addresses are used (with the magic to handle
that).

Devices being cache-coherent with CPUs is already something we manage
per-device.

As above, I think this must be specified per-device, following the usual
manner in which we describe Inner Shareable coherency using
dma-coherent.

Thanks,
Mark.
