Good Evening,

As usually it took more time than I though, but the changes are
quite extensive:

Changes since v4:

* Breaking news: we have a "generic" vexpress machine now!

* TWD DT-based initialization was moved to platform's local timers
  file

* SCU (and generally SMP) initialization was moved to platsmp.c
  file; when there is no memory-mapped SCU (A7/A15) the number
  of available cores is worked in generic way from the tree
  ("cpus" node)

* ... and there was very little left in the "tile" file, so it
  just nicely folded into v2m.c.

* Main compatible value is now "arm,vexpress", so we are back in
  the point we started :-)

* The tiles' trees are now separate patches, but I may fold them
  into one if this is preferred.

Tested on:
- V2P-CA9 with ATAGs
- V2P-CA9 with DT
- V2P-CA5s with DT
- V2P-CA15 with DT
- V2F-2XV6 Cortex-A7 SMM with DT

Previous versions have been tested by Ryan Harkin and provisionally
acked by Rob Herring and Arnd Bergmann.

Thanks for all your help, especially to Dave and Arnd for their
continuous support!
