Patch 7779/1, replacing 7764/1 is in the patch system now, and is ready
to get merged.

Unfortunately cpu/cpus bindings documentation updates, following:

https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/devicetree-discuss/2013-June/036735.html
https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/devicetree-discuss/2013-May/033779.html

were not pulled in the kernel. This is an issue since this means that
we still have no reference in the kernel or wherever it has to be, to
the final cpus/cpu bindings for ARM and ARM64 provided in the pull
request link above (that has been reviewed to death and acknowledged).

It is a significant overhaul of cpu/cpus bindings standard for ARM/ARM64,
covering all CPUs harking back to arm926 and beyond, and should be final.

dts updates following that standard have already been pulled into 3.11
through arm-soc.

IMHO the bindings contained in pull request above must be merged in the
kernel asap, I would like to ask you please what should I do to get them in
please. If we want to move bindings documentation elsewhere let's do it,
as long as there is a published standard I am happy and will stop annoying
you with this stuff.

Thank you very much,
Lorenzo
