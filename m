This is a bit of a surprise and a significant concern.

The whole point behind ACPI is that it's supposed to abstract away nearly
all of that, and _not_ expose clocks, regulators and other things to
the kernel. If we're going to expose it, then we might as well go all
the way and do it with DT.

Exposing all the low-level details of the platform is very much an
embedded mindset today. Servers don't do it with DT, nor with ACPI
today. So if you're going to build a platform for servers that is
modelled after what's done successfully so far, then sticking to that
basic concept seems like an appropriate thing to do.

The additional abstractions that are now pushed onto us has impact for
everybody, and will cause churn on a lot of drivers. Things such as
moving to named resources, etc. While it's easy to say "let's take the
patches one by one", that also means nobody keeps an eye on the bigger
picture and whether the whole thing makes sense or not.

So, I think we need both. Of course we're going to review patches as
they're posted (the alternative doesn't make sense). But we also need
to know what the end goal is. Nobody is presenting that today, and until
we know how steep the slippery slope will get (based on what we can see
so far), we shouldn't start down it.
