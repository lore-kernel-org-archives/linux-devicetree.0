Hi Greg,

 This patchset adds a new simple NVMEM framework to kernel, and it is tested
with various drivers like "QCOM thermal sensors", "QCOM cpr driver",
"begal bone cape manager" and few more on the way.

Thankyou all for providing inputs and comments on previous versions of this
patchset. Here is the v8 of the patchset addressing all the issues raised as
part of previous versions review.

Up until now, NVMEM drivers like eeprom were stored in drivers/misc, where they
all had to duplicate pretty much the same code to register a sysfs file, allow
in-kernel users to access the content of the devices they were driving, etc.
This was also a problem as far as other in-kernel users were involved, since
the solutions used were pretty much different from on driver to another, there
was a rather big abstraction leak.
    
Introduction of this framework aims at solving this. It also introduces DT
representation for consumer devices to go get the data they require (MAC
Addresses, SoC/Revision ID, part numbers, and so on) from the NVMEMs.
    
After learning few things about QCOM qfprom and other eeprom/efuses, which
has packed fields at bit level. Which makes it important to add support to
such memories. This version adds support to this type of non volatile
memories by adding support to bit level nvmem-cells.

Having regmap interface to this framework would give much better
abstraction for nvmems on different buses.

patch 1-4 Introduces the NVMEM framework.
Patch 5-6 Adds Qualcomm specific qfprom driver.
Patch 7 migrates an existing driver to nvmem framework.
Patch 8 adds entry in MAINTAINERS.

Its also possible to migrate other nvmem drivers to this framework, and I think
some of them already posted patches based on this framework.

Providers APIs:
	nvmem_register/unregister();

Consumers APIs:
Cell based apis for both DT/Non-DT:
	nvmem_cell_get()/nvmem_cell_put();
	devm_nvmem_cell_get()/devm_nvmem_cell_put();
	of_nvmem_cell_get()
	nvmem_cell_read()/nvmem_cell_write();

Raw byte access apis for both DT/non-DT.
	nvmem_device_get()/nvmem_device_put()
	devm_nvmem_device_get()/nvmem_device_put()
	of_nvmem_device_get()

	nvmem_device_read()/nvmem_device_write();
	nvmem_device_cell_read()/nvmem_device_cell_write();

Device Tree:

	/* Provider */
	qfprom: qfprom@00700000 {
		...

		/* Data cells */
		tsens_calibration: calib@404 {
			reg = <0x404 0x10>;
		};

		tsens_calibration_bckp: calib_bckp@504 {
			reg = <0x504 0x11>;
			bits = <6 128>
		};

		pvs_version: pvs-version@6 {
			reg = <0x6 0x2>
			bit-offset = 7;
			bits = <7 2>
		};

		speed_bin: speed-bin@c{
			reg = <0xc 0x1>;
			bits = <2 3>;

		};
		...
	};
/* Consumer */
	tsens {
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&tsens_calibration>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "calibration";
	};

userspace interface: binary file in /sys/bus/nvmem/devices/*/nvmem

ex:
hexdump /sys/bus/nvmem/devices/qfprom0/nvmem
