Would be readable if it like this...

fsl,sai-synchronous-rx: This is a boolean property. If present, indicating
			that SAI will work in the synchronous mode (sync Tx with Rx) which means
			both the transimitter and receiver will send and receive data by following
			receiver's bit clocks and frame sync clocks.
- fsl,sai-asynchronous: This is a boolean property. If present, indicating
			that SAI will work in the asynchronous mode, which means both transimitter
			and receiver will send and receive data by following their own bit clocks
			and frame sync clocks separately.
