We shouldn't have any Linux-specific bindings. It might be reasonable to
define a binding for a "simple CODEC", but there's no reason it should
be Linux-specific.

That should be internal to the driver; it's Linux-specific.

Judging by the example, those are nodes not properties.

Stream name is also probably too Linux-specific.

I think the binding should specify on-the-wire formats, not in-memory
formats. For example, if this binding is used to represent an I2S CODEC,
it's more important to know whether it supports left-justified,
right-justified, DSP mode, etc., and the max number of bits (or perhaps
a list of supported numbers of bits) per channel in each case.
