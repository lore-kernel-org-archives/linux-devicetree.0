I am a firmware engineer who tries very hard to deliver quality firmware 
that does the right thing.  It often seems to me that the Linux kernel 
community's general distrust of firmware is a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
  People often "live down to expectations"; if Linux expects the 
firmware to be worthless, worthless is often what you get.

In the PC BIOS world, the quality of BIOSes went up dramatically when 
Microsoft began insisting that the BIOS must meet stringent standards, 
enforced via an exhaustive suite of compatibility tests.
