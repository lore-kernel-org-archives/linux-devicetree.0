Having a node for each debug area indeed doesn't look good. We could
as will stick a single node under /sys/kernel/debug/ which would enable/disable
the debug component.

I am OK with it being tied to nohlt. In that case we will have to add
a Kconfig dependency on GENERIC_IDLE_POLL_SETUP (though it is selected
by default on ARM/ARM64). Parsing the boot command line for nohlt doesn't
look like a good idea. We may have to figure out a way to do that. Also,
please could you add support for building this as a module ? Since it
doesn't depend on the coresight bus anyway, it should be pretty straight
forward.
