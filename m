Oh crap. A gigantic can of worms...

Would a patch (completely untested btw) along this line of thinking make
any difference whatsoever?

Yeah, I know, all other drm_bridges also need to fill in .owner, and
the .of_node member could probably be ditched from struct drm_device
etc, but this was just a quick sketch...
