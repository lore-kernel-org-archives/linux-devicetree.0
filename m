Actually I've come up with a nicer way to deal with the ordering issues
around setting the device-properties from the machine-driver.

If we attach the properties in the machine-driver *before* calling
snd_soc_register_card() and check them from the codec/component driver's
probe function (rather then from the i2c_driver.probe function), then
there is no need for a codec private apply_properties() function to
get the ordering right, since the codec/component driver's probe
function is called from snd_soc_register_card().

This still needs some comments in both the codec and machine driver
to make sure that future changes don't cause issues, but it gets rid
of the ugly apply_properties() function call from the machine-driver.

I'm currently preparing a v3 with this change + other requested changes.
I need to re-run a bunch of tests before posting, so I hope to post the
v3 series tomorrow.

Regards,

Hans
