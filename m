This sounds reasonable, my impression was also that devicetree might be 
not the best place to put such a sequencing information.

We would just provide a one-time configuration data, without an indication 
of how the configuration should be performed when there are multiple 
clocks listed. As an usual DT practice the order of configuration wouldn't
be defined by the binding.
