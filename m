Indeed, this commit explains it further:

commit de1dd9fd2156874b45803299b3b27e65d5defdd9
regulator: core: Provide hints to the core about optional supplies

Yes, I think so. So we have a possibly complete binding right from the 
beginning. I someone needs handling other supplies than AVDD they could
update the driver in future.
