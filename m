Ah right.

I understand your concern. Arnd, a thought about it ? The only viable
alternative would be to move it to arch/arm/plat-pxa AFAIS.

I've been trying.

As I said, I understand your concern.

Is not only a irqchip because, as explained at the bottom of the commit message,
quoting myself :
  This patch moves all that handling to a mfd driver. It's only purpose
  for the time being is the interrupt handling, but in the future it
  should encompass all the motherboard CPLDs handling :
   - leds
   - switches
   - hexleds

When these parts will be added, and they'll have to be handled by this driver
because of iospace sharing, and same IP (cplds) providing the hardware support,
the irqchip way will be just impossible to follow.

As I said above, I understand your concern. If we all reach a concensus this
should be moved to the pxa tree, so be it. But I'd like other opinion here.

Cheers.
