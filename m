Agree, no point in saving lr, but I still need to decrease sp with 16 to
maintain correct alignment. I'll do it with an str instruction instead.

I assume you're referring to when to use "hvc" and "smc".

I would rather consider smccc_call32() a primitive function that a
driver may use if it's configured to do so, for instance via DT. When an
"hvc" should be used instead of an "smc" up to the driver to decide
based how it's configured.

When merging psci-call.S and smccc-call.S into fw-call.S, what should I
do about smccc.c? I need to export the smccc_call32 function somewhere
as it could be used from a loadable module.
