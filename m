But it does not have to expose everything. And what will be your 
definition of everything in that case?

Maybe, but... so what? This is not because you can do it with MFD that 
you cannot make it more flexible with DT.
Preferring to hard code that in MFD is similar to keeping all the static 
C board files we are all trying to remove. It is possible, sure, but 
there are now better way to describe HW modules than hard-coding that in 
a C file.

Moreover, there is not an unique way to describe the HW. So for sure we 
will cheat a little bit and make some assumption about what the SW will 
really use. But otherwise you will end up putting the full RTL inside 
the DT node.
It is very similar to the discussion we had for the clock tree. For sure 
we can describe the full clock tree in DT, but that's huge and useless. 
So we are taking some assumption and expose only the ones that have to 
be exposed because dependent of the board or needed by the devices.

As I said before; there is not a single way to describe that kind of HW. 
But still this description is perfectly valid for the HW point of view. 
It just does not represent all the details inside the CODEC. But the way 
DT is done, nothing can prevent someone else to add further details 
below that node assuming there will be some SW to use that at some point.

It is up to the driver owner to assess the level of information he'd 
like to expose to DT based on the number of chip variants that already 
exist.

So far, MFD was the only way to describe some HW hierarchy in a SoC that 
only have platform_device.
Now, DT can do that as well without hard coding some sub device 
information inside a driver, thus allowing you to change that sub-device 
without changing the driver.

Both formats are valid.
It is just a matter of flexibility / personal choice / mood of the day.

The important point is that this is not a black or white kind of 
decision, we can be in the grey area and use a little bit of both approach.

Thanks,
Benoit
