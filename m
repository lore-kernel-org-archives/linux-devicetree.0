Discussed with USB IC module owner, some feedback like below:
- You are correct, the input clock for controller is always same, there
are three sources:
	- ahb
	- xcvr_clk
	- xcvr_ser_clk
- ahb: the source is the system ipg and ahb source, but for usb subsystem,
there is NO separate control for ipg and ahb, there is only one bit
to control ipg and ahb clock together, just like we say usboh3_ipg_ahb bit
at CCM for mx51. The USB controller internal will have two clocks, one for
ipg (visit register), and the other is ahb (access DDR). 
>From the system point, we only need to control usboh3_ipg_ahb,
so, this clock is better as "usb_ahb". "ipg" clock for usb may only the
system ipg clock.

-xcvr_clk: it is the phy output clk, the software can't control it,
(for mx28/mx6q, it can be controlled from phy controller), the software
can only choose the PHY clk source.

-xcvr_ser_clk, it is used at serial phy mode, we need it as the default
phy mode is serial.
I find we take it as "usb_per" at mx5 platform, but this xcvr_ser_clk is
fixed (60M), and can't be adjusted (it is not different with 54M TLL clock).

So in order to consolidate i.mx usb clock, do you think below definitions
are ok:
usb_ahb: ahb clock used to visit register and access DDR
usb_ipg: system ipg clock (mx28 usb no ipg clock)
usb_per: serial phy clock, it is useless if serial phy is not supported, eg mx28, mx6q.
usb_phy: phy clock source, either from 24M or PLL.

So, in order to align with kinds of platforms, I suggest:
If the clock exists and share the same bit at CCM with others
(like usb_ahb and usb_ipg at some platforms), give the same clock num
but different connection id.
If the clock does not exists, just give a dummy clock but with 
connection id (like usb_per at imx6q).
