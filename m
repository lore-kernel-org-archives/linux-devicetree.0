Ok, I see you deleted the part where I was asking about the 'staging' folders.

$ find . -name 'stag*'
./Documentation/devicetree/bindings/staging
./drivers/staging
...

I don't know if that was intended (since you said you did not read it) but
I think it would be interesting for the discussion to give a little overview
on that.
My understanding is that there's a 'staging' area for bindings, couldn't the
nodes/properties from my example be put in there?

I'm sorry, that was not my intention.
I just assumed that because your paragraph mentioned the word "driver" and
appears to have been Linux-only effort geared towards writing drivers:
   "...We had to sort out fundamentals before prototype driver code could be
written, and while we knew drivers were coming..."

Maybe I miss some more context on that example.

I see.
So if I understood correctly, it was a cleanup, or a way to unify some
bindings, so that drivers could be written easier?

I can see that taking time, but the underlying idea of this discussion is
that the DT could be divided in different sections.

I think this would allow and encourage SoC manufacturers to publish more
details, since they could use them internally as well.

Obviously, this is not strictly necessary, and I'm sure SoC manufacturers
could choose to just avoid having to deal with the open-source community
entirely by using forks.

However, that does not benefit the community and allows a "one-way" street,
with companies "profiting" from open-source software (in this example,
they would profit unwillingly, yet out of the necessity to avoid dealing
with outside 'restrictions' perceived as unnecessary).

It seems it is a similar case to that of allowing or not binary
drivers/blobs.
If they were not allowed, less companies would choose Linux.
I don't want to go into that discussion, but it seems similar enough to
this one for it to be worth mentioning.

Ok, but in this case the DT author (SoC manufacturer) would have interest
in using it.

I think it is likely this has already happened, even with the current
constraints on review.

Case c) could happen even when a driver is provided, for example if the
driver writer got incomplete documentation.

At any rate, since there was no user, even if the bindings need amending,
it should be easy to do, since there's no backwards compatibility to keep.

I have the impression that this basically means that DT is Linux only.
Did I misunderstood?

What legitimacy does Linux expects to have when dealing with bindings whose
users are not Linux? For example, FreeBSD, U-Boot or others.
In other words, why would Linux usage and policies regarding DT have to affect
other users of DT?

That essentially limits DT usage;
Of course, it can be forked, etc. like you state below, but that is not the
best outcome for everybody, because this basically forces the use of
undocumented binary DT overlays.

Yes, I'm aware of that possibility, but in that case we would not be having
this conversation :-)

Basically, IMHO there is no reason for this thing to be black or white when
it could be gray and have a win-win situation, that's all.

I see that you did not comment on my example, was that intended?

But you said earlier that bindings for users different from Linux are considered.
Did I miss something?

I understand, but nothing prevents the creation of DT 'sections':
- a section using rubber-stamped "official" bindings
- a section using 'staging' bindings
right?
What technical issues would this have?

Sebastian
