 And Then Some, stephen.  there are two versions of u-boot being used:
one is the community-assembled [GPL-compliant] one, and the other
includes a [as-of-a-few-days-ago-but-no-longer, yay!]
formerly-GPL-violating one from allwinner.

 the community-based one *doesn't* have fex integration (i don't
think, but henrik will know for sure), but the allwinner one
definitely does.

 .... and then there's the boot0 and boot1 loaders, these *do* have
fex integration: they're absolutely tiny and they're designed to fit
into the 1st level cache.  the job of these bootloaders is to set up
the DDR3 RAM timings (so that you can access DRAM!!) and to then
decide whether to load from NAND, SD/MMC etc. and many other things.

 these boot0 and boot1 loaders are themselves configureable so that
you can specify, through script.fex, what GPIO is to be the "reset
key" and so on.  that's a much simplified story btw.

 so the point is: if anyone wishes me to propose to allwinner that
they convert over to devicetree, or any other proposal which involves
significant low-level changes to their working practices that could
potentially have a massive knock-on effect onto their
multi-million-dollar clients, it had better be a damn good story.
