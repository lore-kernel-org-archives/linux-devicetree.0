This has been the source of confusion before.

You're right, it's not used in the current patch.  And
because of this, I'll delete it, and add it back once
we have a clock supported that requires it.

But while we're on the subject, here's what it's for.

Each clock has a defined set of parent clocks, and
each has a small integer value that represents it in
a register that controls their selection.  In some
cases the reset value of that register field is a
(specific) value that has no defined clock associated
with it.

Here's an example.  There's a clock "hub_clk_ssp3_audio",
which has three parent clocks:  "ref_crystal" (selector
value 0),  "ref_312m" (selector value 1), and "cx40"
(selector value 2).  But on reset, the value in that
selector field is 3.

This clock is used to represent that "none selected" value.

Thank you.  I really appreciate the reviews Mark.
