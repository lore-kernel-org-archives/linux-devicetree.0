I prefer using the hierarchy to describe the relationship between
sibling nodes, in favour of using comments and code review to keep
things in order.

This also mean that nodes that are not references by other parts of the
tree does not need a label.

That said, I've promised to write some patches to convert the prior
platforms to this structure, so let's see how that turns out in
practice - although it's still just an indication of what a fully
described board would look like.

The rx pin is typically bias-pull-up and tx bias-disable, so I would
expect the same.

This is indeed a source of confusion, in particular since there tend to
be different numbering depending on what part of the puzzle you look at.
But you're right that each QUP has a number of engines, each one being a
UART/I2C/SPI controller.

I don't see a reason for labeling this particular node though, aliases
references individual engines, not the wrapper.
