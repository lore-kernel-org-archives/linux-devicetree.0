I do agree, my point was not about the driver usage but about how the 
device node should populate its irq entry. The +32 offset is due to the 
internal implementation of the GIC. That should not be exposed outside 
the MPUSS.

Here are the first IRQs from the OMAP4430 public TRM.

MA_IRQ_0 L2_CACHE_IRQ CORTEXA9 L2 cache controller interrupt
MA_IRQ_1 CTI_IRQ_0 CORTEXA9 Cross-trigger module 0 (CTI0) interrupt
MA_IRQ_2 CTI_IRQ_1 CORTEXA9 Cross-trigger module 1 (CTI1) interrupt
MA_IRQ_3 Reserved Reserved Reserved
MA_IRQ_4 ELM_IRQ ELM Error location process completion
MA_IRQ_5 Reserved Reserved Reserved
MA_IRQ_6 Reserved Reserved Reserved
MA_IRQ_7 sys_nirq1 External External interrupt 1 (active low)
MA_IRQ_8 Reserved Reserved Reserved
MA_IRQ_9 L3_DBG_IRQ L3 L3 interconnect debug error
MA_IRQ_10 L3_APP_IRQ L3 L3 interconnect application error
MA_IRQ_11 PRCM_MPU_IRQ PRCM PRCM interrupt
...

It is a 0 based index, and thus this is the value I'm expecting to enter 
in the irq attribute of the DT node.

Benoit
