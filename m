No, that's new. It was far worse before.

Well, the alternative is to rewrite the whole of irqdomain and
everything that gets called from there in terms of fwnode_handle. Which
will trickle in the whole of OF as well.

Note that the fake DT node doesn't represent an ACPI object at all. It
is an identifier for an irqdomain, and that's where it stops.
