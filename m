The goal of the mid layer is to bring all these differences into a
common abstraction, not punt on them to higher layers.

The goal if the driver is to translate and transport the common
abstraction to the hardware.

It is an absolute failure if each TEE driver implements a different
TEEC_OpenSession() ioctl. They must be the same, the common code
must de-marshal the request from user space and then call
ops->open_session()

Driver specific ioctls are a terrible way to start a new mid layer.

So this TEE stuff also encompasses a 'firmware' loader (to the secure
world, presumably)?

That is probably your base level of 'ops' functionality, plus the
shared memroy stuff.

How does this work if two userspace things run concurrently with
different firmwares? Is there some locking or something? What is the
lifetime of this firmware tied to?

So you load the firmare, learn what command set it supports then use
TEE_IOC_CMD to shuttle firmware-specific data to and from?

I would use read/write for this, not ioctl. read/write can work with
select/poll so you can send your command then go into a polling loop
waiting for the reply from the firmware.
