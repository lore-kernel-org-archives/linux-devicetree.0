First I would like to complete my review for device tree bindings and
then planning to send the driver for review. please let me know if this is not
the right way to do?

As said above each channel has its own register space and separate interrupt,
i am treating each dma channel as standalone dma controller i.e dma
controller with
single channel. So, the below node describes for single channel and
other channel
nodes can follow the below example.

Ok i will take care of this in next version. thanks.
