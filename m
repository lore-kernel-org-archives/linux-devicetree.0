I've already promised Samuel that.

I don't think so, no. I appreciate what you are trying to say, but I
object to mixing ideas for the sake of reducing number of files. The
config infrastructure is completely independent from the sysreg. Each o=
f
them can exist on its own. The only common thing is a (slightly baroque=
)
communication interface between those two.

This is an interesting idea. The thing that worries me the most is its
early (pre-slab) availability, but I will give it a try.
