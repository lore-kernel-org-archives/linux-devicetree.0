Thanks for getting the current version out even with the long TODO
list. I've had my first deeper look at some of the patches and found
a few more things that likely require substantial rework. I also think
there is still significant room for simplifying it further, and getting
better performance out of it in the process.

Also, despite the criticism in my patch review, I have to say you've
done a great job at cutting out a lot of the things that were present
in the past, it's good to see that you have come this far with the
cleanup!
