Bjorn,

I have refreshed/rebuilt the series from what was on 25th in linux-next=
 and I have
dropped this patch. I have pushed the series into=20

git://linux-arm.org/linux-ld.git for-upstream/pci-next

I hope that I've carried all your Sign-off-bys correctly, but I would l=
ike to ask you
to double check that I haven't screwed up things.

This patch dates from the times I was trying to add the domain number i=
nformation
into the pci_host_bridge structure. Now, with Catalin's patch that adds=
 the data in
the pci_bus structure, this is not needed, so it is safe to drop. I did=
 try to fix
the patch but I've realised how intricately linked pci_host_bridge and =
root bus are,
which to my opinion is a strong hint that the creation of the two shoul=
d be split
into separate functions.

I can send an official v13 patchset to the mailing list if you want, bu=
t if not, here
is the changelog:

- updated "[PATCH 01/12] asm-generic/io.h: Fix ioport_map() for !CONFIG=
_GENERIC_IOMAP" to match
  the patch that Thierry Reding has submitted through the asm-generic b=
ranch. If his
  series lands first upstream this patch will be skipped.
- updated "[PATCH 03/12] ARM: Define PCI_IOBASE as the base of virtual =
PCI IO space" to
  cast the PCI_IOBASE value to (void __iomem *) as is the case with mos=
t #defined versions
- dropped the patch that was changing the order of initialisation betwe=
en pci_host_bridge
  and root bus in pci_create_root_bus()
- fixed "[PATCH 07/12] PCI: Add generic domain handling" to account for=
 the previous patch
  being removed
- fixed the title of commit 08/12 to reflect the name of the functions =
that are actually
  added (s/of_pci_get_domain_nr/pci_get_new_domain_nr/)

I've compiled tested the series on sparc, microblaze (no)mmu_defconfig,=
 arm omap2plus_defconfig
and multi_v7_defconfig and arm64. I've also tested the series on my Jun=
o (arm64) board.

Sorry for causing this amount of churn! And to Yinghai Lu and Jiang Liu=
: appologies for not
including you in the Cc list, I'm still getting the grip on the whole s=
ubmission process.

Best regards,
Liviu
