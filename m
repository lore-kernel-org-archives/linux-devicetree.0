I was hoping that using phys/phy-names would allow us to get rid of
nr-ports property. I haven't checked the corresponding code and likely
will not before next year, but we should try to get rid of the nr-ports
property completely.

Yeah, saw that patch after the review.. and my understanding of the
phys/phy-names properties is that
(a) they allow to count the number of _available_ ports
(b) they allow to determine the number of _used_ ports
(c) they allow to e.g. disable port 0 but enable port 1

while nr-ports only allows (a). You can derive (b) only if you use
the first out of two but you cannot do (c) with nr-ports.

Which is why we introduced the phys/phy-names properties.
