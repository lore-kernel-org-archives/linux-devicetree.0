Right. This is why I have reposted and copied those whom commented on my
pull request. I think at least some of Saravana's concerns boiled down
to not requiring using DT clock bindings and not requiring driver
changes to move to DT bindings. Both of these are met with this series.
A platform can still use clkdev tables for binding clocks to devices and
does not have to use DT for clocks. Drivers generally should not require
any changes that I'm aware of, but if there are any concrete examples
I'd like to know.

Yes, I think this should go thru you.
