Well I can easily use one phandle per pinmux controller instance
instead of one phandle per pin, so let's plan on doing that.

Yes I think that's pretty close to what I'm using, just few
minor comments below.

Assuming this is describing the pins a driver is using, how
about calling it pins?

That's because you might want to do all the muxing in a
bootloader, but still need to tell how many pins you're using
for MMC on a device. So it actually has a wider meaning than just
mux.

Also, we need to standardize on some name to use for parsing pins
using of_parse_phandle_with_args, and I suggested #pin-args.

Here I don't quite understand how config is different from pins/mux
above? It seems to set the driver/pull stuff, but why don't you
just make #pin-args larger and have a wider pin array?

Something like:

	pins =
	<&tegra_pmx TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTA TEGRA_PMX_MUX_1 TEGRA_PMX_CONF_TRISTATE 1
	 &tegra_pmx TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTD TEGRA_PMX_MUX_1 TEGRA_PMX_CONF_TRISTATE 1>;

and in the parent set #pin-args to 3.

Sorry I don't quite follow, can you please maybe repost a complete
.dts entry for your pin controller and one driver entry?

Yes it does, other than the comments above.
