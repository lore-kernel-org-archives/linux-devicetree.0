Yes, it was a fairly recent change. iounmap on one of these areas
will do nothing.

That should not really be a concern, you only waste a little bit of
the vmalloc space that you gained recently when ioremap was changed.
Nothing should ever be able to get to those pointers other than by
calling ioremap, so it doesn't hurt to have them mapped, except for
the very unlikely scenario that you get a wild pointer dereference
in the kernel that would otherwise result in an oops.

Well, if you use the 4k mappings here, you won't benefit from reduced
TLB pressure through section maps, although you still get rid of IO_ADDRESS.
I would not put any devices into the static mapping, other than those
you need to access before mm_init() or when you can actually use the section
mapping.
