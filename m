For some userspace feature sure, but this is kernel code, there is no
guarantee for a sable API, in fact some would probably argue even
further that there is a guarantee that stuff *will* change and this is a
good thing as it kinda serves to punish for those you don't try to upstream.

So the helpfulness bar should be zero for changes that break out-of-tree
stuff.

Even more so this patch isn't a zero gain, the cleaner, better looking,
and easier to maintain code *is* the benefit in itself. Plus we gain the
ability to set mic-gain voltage with ACPI, something you couldn't do
before this patch.
