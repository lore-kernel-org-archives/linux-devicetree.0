Sure thing. I was just making sure I clarified my initial statement.

Ok.

Ah. It wasn't at all clear to me that the order was in relation to the
MMIO space.

How is it possible to tell if an context is unused?

Are those mandated to be linear and contiguous in the address space?

How is the relationship between an MMIO context and hart determined?

I'm not sure that it makes sense to use -1 in this manner, since the
first cell of each interrupts-extended tuple entry is a phandle. IIRC
zero is currently de-facto invalid, and if we really need a NULL
phandle, we should get that clarified in the DT spec.

It might be better to describe each MMIO context separately, and then
associate IRQs with those in-order.

So you use the reference to the HLIC to implictly provide the CPU
affinity? Or do you assume that these align with the SBI-provided CPU
IDs?

Thanks,
Mark.
