I would agree with Rob here. It may be better to provide a sysfs
interface to configure that particular behavior. This is usually ok
because the use case is:
 - the RTC is not configured, time has never been set
 - time is set for the first time
 - the user can set the oscillator mode/detection/...
 - on subsequent reboots, the mode is kept alongside the time and date

I would advise against trying to set a mode automatically in the driver
because you may have unexpected power cuts and it may then let the RTC
consume more power than what you really want.

I'll try to collect the existing common properties and write that doc
this week.
