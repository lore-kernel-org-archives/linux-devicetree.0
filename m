drivers/mailbox is a framework for interfacing/abstracting hardware
mailboxes. If you're starting to layer mailboxes ontop of each-other
chances are very high that you're confusing it with the computer
science term "mailbox".

Abstracting a doorbell-like piece of hardware behind the mbox
framework makes a lot of sense, but the interface between your clients
and the code that fills out shared memory and then invokes said
doorbell is a higher level of "mailbox" and is probably better
implemented using a direct function call.
