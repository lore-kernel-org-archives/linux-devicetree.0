The "mandating dma-ranges" part was something that Arnd had mentioned,
so my interpretation of the rationale might differ slightly, but I
generally didn't disagree. Perhaps my wording is at fault here, but by
"device addressing capabilities" I do mean the capabilities of the
device as integrated into the system, (i.e. whatever interconnect it's
attached to) rather than whatever might be inherent to the device
itself. Nobody's suggesting we start using dma-ranges in some way other
than its existing definition, just that we should put it on any bus
which is not 32 bits wide (in the manner of e.g. amd-seattle-soc.dtsi).

A secondary issue here is that ePAPR/DTSpec isn't particularly clear
about dma-ranges, or more specifically what its absence implies. The
assumption which seems to exist through much of the (PPC) OF code is
that it should be present on any bus which allows DMA through to its
parent, but then for FDT at least we end up sort-of respecting that but
mostly ignoring it such that missing dma-ranges is assumed equivalent to
empty dma-ranges (and thus we also have no way to actually say "children
of this bus that might think they can do DMA, can't").

Now, "devices know their addressing capability" is precisely the problem
that the original commit referenced here was trying to tackle, but the
code turns out to only work correctly in the case where the dma-ranges
size is *less* than 32 bits (it's 31 bits on Keystone, which was the
original platform in question). More generally on 64-bit systems we're
ending up with configurations like a 64-bit NVMe device on PCIe behind
an IOMMU with 48-bit-wide interfaces, neither of which are aware that
only 32/44/etc. bits of address are wired up on the SoC buses in between
it all, and truncation-based hilarity ensues. In order to make use of
dma-ranges as the correct tool for the job, this first wants un-breaking
to properly interpret buses with n-bit limitations where 32 < n < 64.
Then we can actually start preventing drivers from setting wider masks
where a bus limitation exists.

The problem that arises then is what to do when no range is described -
do we change the default mask to 64 bits to represent "no limit" and let
any remaining (bad) drivers relying implicitly on the (deeply-ingrained)
32-bit default start subtly going wrong, or do we play it safe and stick
with the 32-bit default, but with the side effect that nobody can then
DMA above 4GB unless they set an explicitly larger dma-ranges. I believe
the latter was what Arnd was in favour of, and which is alluded to in
this commit message, but in truth I'm equally happy to take either
approach. What I *don't* want is to end up with a bunch of
special-casing where we sometimes allow drivers to enlarge their
device's DMA mask and sometimes don't depending on DT vs. ACPI, some
property present vs. absent, wind direction etc.

Fair enough - some maintainers seem to like fixes tags on anything that
purely corrects something introduced by a previous patch, even if
non-critical, and I don't always guess right :) FWIW I wouldn't consider
this one for stable either (I'd have added the tag myself if so).

Yes, the only change here is that if dma-ranges is present, then its
actual specified size will be now propagated to a newly created device's
initial DMA mask, as opposed to being munged with a fixed 32 bits and/or
whatever the bus code set (which is generally also 32 bits) along the
way. The fact that drivers will then unconditionally stomp on that mask
when they probe with whatever larger or smaller mask they "know" is
appropriate remains unchanged - it's just that however we start tackling
*that* problem we need the dma-ranges info to get through unmolested in
the first place.

(It transpires that we also fail to handle it at all for PCI host
bridges in FDT where we don't have OF nodes for the children, but that's
something else; I'm looking into it.)
