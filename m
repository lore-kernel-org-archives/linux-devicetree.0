I think this ref_clk is ULPI PHY vendor specific, at USB3317, it is
26Mhz.

I think you are right, since controller only concerns the output clock.
So, if you have not enabled xcvr, you may meet hang when set portsc.pts too?

At some designs, ULPI input clock (ref_clk) may from Soc internal,
without enabling it, the controller will not get PHY clock (60Mhz).
When visiting portsc.pts, may meet hang.

Ok, ulpi phy works like USB device on USB bus which create device at
runtime. So, like some hard-wired USB devices, it may needs power
sequence too, otherwise, how it knows which driver can loads.
