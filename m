Thanks for your patch!

Checking a hardware register is indeed a better solution than my original
idea to let SMP bringup set a flag in RAM, as the former is less racy.
However, as you can probably imagine, I don't like the
shmobile_wdt_clock_status part ;-)

Isn't is sufficient to check the MMU enable bit?
However, that would precludes uClinux (do we care?).
Is there any other register/bit that's reset when the watchdog is
triggered, and always set by Linux?

shmobile_boot_vector is not only used for R-Car Gen2 and RZ/G1 SoCs, but
also for EMMA Mobile, SH/R-Mobile, and R-Car H1.  Hence this breaks SMP
for the latter (and their build if ARCH_RENESAS=n, due to missing
shmobile_wdt_clock_status).

This breaks backwards compatibility with old DTs declaring a too small
smp-sram area. If the area is too small, you should fallback to the old and
smaller code.

This should become e.g. rcar_gen2_boot_vector_wdt

This should become

    ENTRY(shmobile_boot_vector)
