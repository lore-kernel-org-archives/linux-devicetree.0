If I understand correctly, we would like drivers to be able to read
some common "system" registers to figure out which SoC variant we are
running on. Such feature should normally be provided by code in
arch/arm/mach-*/ and called by drivers, but we are trying to eliminate
all dependencies of driver code on architecture code, correct?

So, wouldn't we need a small, architecture-independent, infrastructure,
through which architecture-specific code could "register" at boot
time which SoC we are running on, and drivers could query this
information from the common infrastructure?

Of course, the major problem is to figure out what is the good
representation for this SoC identifier. Do we need a big list of SoCs
like we had machine IDs? A simple string? Or maybe there is just no
good way, and the whole idea is moot.

Best regards,

Thomas
