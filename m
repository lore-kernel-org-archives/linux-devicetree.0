It does, as other behavior would clearly be a bug that should not be
worked around in the DT itself.

We are using of_platform_populate() to populate the root bus. From the
comment above this function:
"It differs in that it follows the modern convention of requiring all
device nodes to have a 'compatible' property, and it is suitable for
creating devices which are children of the root node
(of_platform_bus_probe will only create children of the root which are
selected by the @matches argument)."

Lucas
