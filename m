I read through the original thread from Tim Bird and FWIW I agree with
the assessment that passing the FDT through MD5 first is a good
approach.

Thinking into the future, I'd expect to see similar variable data in
DT on servers as we see in DMI, including:
  - Vendor serial number for the HW, manufacturing date, model number,
    and HW UUID
  - Serial numbers and vendor part numbers for DIMMS
  - MAC addresses for all the ethernet
  - OEM specific data

At worst a 'choosen/linux,no-dt-random = 1' value in the DT to disable
it would solve the problem for those in embedded that care about
microseconds during booting.

Jason
