I'm sure you did. I just tried to summarise the main points of it above.

Agreed. My suggestion in the thread above was along the lines of generic
use-neutral rtt and gmbr nodes, and then an additional attribute to the
rtt node (which can be set in a specific board dts, when enabling the
rtt) providing a gmbr handle (and register number) for the rtc-at91sam9
driver to use.

This in itself does not resolve which rtt-driver would get bound if
there is ever another one (and the gmbr attribute is present), though.

It's at least not hard to imagine other uses for the battery-backed up
gmbr registers.

I'll look into how that could be implemented.

Ok, let's do that. :)
