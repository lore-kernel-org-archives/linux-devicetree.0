Using UEFI is painful enough on Juno.  Using a 2 year old version with
"that" menu system is even worse.

So I'll just pitch in here and recommend you switch to using u-boot.
Then you can see your config with "printenv" and you'll probably
understand it too.

The board will boot my prebuilt kernel/DTB using u-boot if you erase
the uSD card and unzip this firmware image to it:

http://releases.linaro.org/members/arm/platforms/16.10/juno-latest-oe-uboot.zip

Then you can copy over your own kernel & DTB for your own testing,
configure u-boot for TFTP, or whatever you like.

Switching to u-boot won't solve any thermal sensor calibration problems.
