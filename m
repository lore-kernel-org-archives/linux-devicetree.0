Hi Thierry,

thanks again for your patience!

Correct, and that's the PCI driver for the FPGA, which is (among other 
things) a PCI-to-localbus bridge.

Correct.

That's not 100% right. The PCI driver will only _provide_ the region for 
BAR1 (as it is a bridge), not _access_ it.

Because it would be a *separate* driver, the one handling the /external/ 
"slave" device, to use that region.

In principle, if I wanted to reuse that same external device on a 
completely different architecture (which *does* natively provide a 
localbus) I should be able to move that same device node together with 
its driver. Provided the node is under the right bus, and translation is 
configured properly in the device tree, it should then work out of the 
box. Or am I completely mistaken?

What I did now (and it works) was to put the device node for the 
external device right under the main bus,

/ {
...
	ocp@f1000000 {
		slave@0,0 {
...
			compatible = "keymile,slave";
			reg = <0xe0000000 0x200>;
		};
	};
};

where "0xe0000000" is hardcoded, being the result of the dynamic assignment:

pci 0000:01:00.0: BAR 1: assigned [mem 0xe0000000-0xe7ffffff]

I'd like to avoid that, saying "slave@0,0 is accessible through the 
memory area 0x0-0x200 within BAR1 of device 0 on bus 1".

Thanks again,
Gerlando
