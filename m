Yes, this is my problem.  I have multiple I2C busses on my system, and there's no way to guess which one is connected to the DVI port.  A phandle in the device tree is the only way I can figure out which I2C bus to use.  But there's another problem.  I can use of_find_i2c_device_by_node() to determine the i2c_client (and therefore, the i2c_adapter) to use for fb_ddc_read().  However, that function only works if the I2C device was probed.  That typically is done by the I2C driver for the device, but there is no "edid" device driver.  So my framebuffer driver is going to have to pretend to be one.

I wish there were some way to obtain the i2c_adapter struct more easily.

I also have this problem.  I need to toggle a GPIO in order to get the I2C bus connected to the DVI port.  The same I2C bus is used for the audio codec and a bunch of other devices.  Our SOC has four I2C busses, so I don't understand why the board designed didn't dedicate one for the DDC.  But I can easily work around this issue.
