Are the other alises still used?  If not, we should perhaps get rid of
them, or keep them on an as-needed basis only?

Since alises are by definition a point of standardisation (otherwise
there's no need for an alias) I think they need to be documented alongside
bindings wherever we have them.

Hmmm, editing snafu there.

I think I was referring to the ARCH_VEXPRESS_DT item, which is defined
just after the lines I quoted.

I don't have a strong feeling about it.  Printing a warning is certainly
helpful; by definition we don't really know what to do beyond this
point.

So, the choices are: try to do something reasonable, or panic.

There's no right answer.  "Try to do something reasonable" seems as good
as any other option ... and there's always the possibility that it might
work.
