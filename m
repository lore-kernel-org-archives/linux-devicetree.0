Hi,

[RANT]

I tend to disagree about this whole hype about device tree usage for other 
things than pure hardware description. I don't think device tree should be  
a way to force some kind of new world order, but rather a more convenient 
and more maintainable (than board files) way of support hardware platforms 
in Linux kernel.

Assuming that you can change the bootloader... Isn't bootloader this piece 
of code that you shouldn't touch if it's working (especially in production 
environments)?

Why not? For Linux and most of ARM-based platforms device tree is just a 
replacement for board files. They are not going to be used with any other 
imaginary kernel supporting device tree. On many of them even the device 
tree blob will be distributed along with kernel image, if not simply 
appended to the zImage.

I think it should be up to the board/platform maintainer whether they want 
to limit device tree on particular boards/platforms just to hardware 
description or extend it to handle everything that was originally handled 
by board files.

Sure. This is (and has always been) something to account for when bringing 
up new platforms from the ground up.

But you can't always have control over the bootloader. What's wrong in 
letting the kernel configure the board itself? It must configure most of 
the hardware anyway, based on platform data (either located in board files 
or parsed from device tree).

Why not to make the kernel independent from the bootloader at all? Then 
the bootloader could just do some minimal initialization needed to load a 
kernel image from flash memory and launch it (+ some code to allow 
flashing of new images).

Well, so you are basically suggesting to throw away Linux support for 
boards/platforms designed without device tree in mind and on which 
replacing the bootloader is simply infeasible or sometimes even 
impossible.

I don't think that ARM Linux is adopting device tree just to have device 
tree. There are many problems that can be solved using device tree, like 
multiplatform support, separation of board support from kernel code, 
binding consumers with providers (PHYs, GPIOs, clocks, etc.). Why do we 
have to cover all these advantages behind a curtain of new problems?
