AFAIK, it is to represent inter-node memory access latency.

agreed, given that there is no know system to substantiate dual direction,
let us not explicit about direction.

this is based on representing local distance with 10 and
all inter-node latency being represented as multiple of 10.

The local distance is represented as 10, this is fixed and same as in ACPI.
Inter-node distance can be any number greater than 10.
this information can be added here to make it clear.

yes, same as ACPI, local node is 10.
