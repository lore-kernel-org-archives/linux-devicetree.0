Its not so much the usage as the dynamic sizing that I was after.
NR_CPUS will always be the max size, whereas per-cpu data will only use
the amount of storage required to back the number of cpus present.

For this reason we've spend a great deal of effort to remove NR_CPUS
sized arrays all over the core (and x86/ia64 arch) code, since distros
now build with NR_CPUS=4096 but hardly anybody has that many cpus, so
arrays sized that way waste tons of resources.
