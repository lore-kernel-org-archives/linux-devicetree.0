Each port is allocated and de-allocated in dai probe and remove calls 
respectively.

Lets say... So for this case to happen the dai has to be removed (unload 
module) at the same time when the interrupt callback happens due to 
delayed response from previous commands.

This case would be almost impossible because all the calls to afe 
service are synchronous with timeouts, if any of the previous calls 
times out the respective caller would get an error, this should prevent 
him from unloading the module in the first place.
