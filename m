Hi,

This mostly looks pretty good to me, few more comments below.

If you really want to leave out the phandle for each mux entry, this would
require supporting multiple "pin config" entries in a device driver node.

That's because otherwise supporting pins from multiple pinmux controller
instances would not work. Note that we already have two pin controller
instances starting with omap4.

After thinking about this a bit more, I'm now thinking that we should
probably only describe the active state in the device tree to keep things
simple.

Anything PM related could be initialized later on during the boot by the
device driver, or even from userspace using /lib/firmware or /sys entries.
This would cut down the device tree bloat quite a bit.

Setting the initial state from device tree makes sense, but I'm afraid
the standby and off states will require driver interaction depending on
how the user wants to configure the system.

For example, allowing a device to wake up a system might be user
configurable option, such as "Wake up on tapping the touchscreen".

Then I'd rather not use "config" at all, and just put the value for
initial state mux register(s) in the mux to avoid repeating the same data
multiple time. Looks like with the mux + config/mux-config option you
need to duplicate at least TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTA.

BTW, maybe the name "config" should probably be "mux-config" instead?

If we only allow describing the initial state in device tree, then we can
leave out pinctrl-names, and assume the setting is always the initial bootup
state desired.

So to summarize: I suggest we'll just stick to basics to get the system
booting and devices working using device tree. In most cases the device
drivers should be able to configure the suspend and off states in a generic
way using pinctrl API. Everything else, like debugging, we can probably
do with userspace tools.

This would mean just using a minimal subset of your binding, probably
very close to what you originally suggested.

Tony
