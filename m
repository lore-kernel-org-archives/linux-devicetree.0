If the mux handling is really simple, we could it part of the
pl08 driver and key it off the compatible string -- for any
of the known variants that use a mux, we then have the driver
implement the muxing directly.

Or it could be done the other way round: Have a binding for the
mux that implements the generic dma binding, and a driver for
it that registers with of_dma and forwards any
dma_request_slave_channel() call to the underlying driver.
That would even make the mux driver independent of pl08.

I'm not worried about it at all, I'm sure we can do it when
we want to.

I don't think you'd want both pl080 and pl081 in the same
device, so it should be one of the two, plus the primecell
one.

This needs to list the required clock names.

I'd really like to avoid this and move all of it into the dma specifier.
I understand where you are coming from with this given the existing
code, but I'd rather change the driver code to allow a simpler binding.

The main value-add this gives you is a name of the signal, but nobody else
does this, and it seems this is only an artifact of the way the driver today
matches devices that come from platform data.

If you want it just for migration purposes, we can probably put the names
in the platform, but the bus-interface-* should IMHO be expressed in the
dma specifier, the same way we do for the designware part.
