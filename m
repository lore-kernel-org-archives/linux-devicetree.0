Looks like this was a note to myself, translation below:

This is the 'have I been patched' test.
Before patching the my_cpu_offset value will be in tpidr_el1, we copy it to
tpidr_el2.

Once smp_cpus_done() calls apply_alternatives_all(), set_my_cpu_offset() is
patched to write its value into tpidr_el2. CPUs that come online after this
point don't need the value copying, but this cpufeature enable call will still
be called.

The skimmed-over information is that cpufeature's enable methods are called
locally when any core comes online, even after the alternatives have been
applied. (we also modify pstate and set sctlr bits from these).

Would it be clearer if I rewrote the comment as:

The change-since-v1 was paranoia as 'do_copyregs' wasn't always updated: I was
worried about the compiler ditching the '=0' initialisation as its written by
the asm() before being read... but not once we've patched in the alternative.
Having to put 'do_copyregs' on the stack, but then deciding to just allocate it
late was where I thought this might happen. Short-version: I don't trust the
compiler.
