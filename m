Originally this was done to make it more obvious that all DMA allocations
were done with the same device pointer.  Previously there were several
separate devices, and it wasn't very obvious that only one was used (and
required).  Now that we're past that it's not difficult to do as you suggest.

I have now done that, and in the process identified a few more ways to
improve/simplify the code.  The net result is that more lines of code
were removed than were present in "ipa_dma.[ch]".  I see that as a
win (aside from your point below).

Agreed.  Thanks a lot for your review.
