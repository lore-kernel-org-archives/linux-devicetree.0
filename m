Hi,

Andy, I dropped you Reviewed-by tag because of the last change to this
series, so if you could check these again I would much appreciate.

Changes since v5:
- No longer reading "name" device property as fallback.

Changes since v4:
- No changes. There was an extra patch in v3. This was just a resend
  of v3 without that extra patch.

Changes since v3:
- I'm now returning -EOVERFLOW if the buffer is not big enough as
  proposed by Andy.

This is the cover letter from v3:

This is the third version of my proposal for this helper. The
second version can be checked here:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/11/8/1005

I'm now passing the length as proposed by both Rob and Andy. I'm also
leaving the .get_named_child_node fwnode op untouched.
