I could tell, Stephen would have had a heart attack :)

Would you have a link handy?  My first thought was to create a tag, eg
"Sent-through: subsystem <maintainer@example.com>" that I would add to
patches as I pull them in.  After all, I know where I'm sending them.
Or should at any rate.

True.

It would be helpful if there were a complement to 'git merge-base', say
'git merge-tip' to point to the merge commit that joined the branch
containing commit X.

Run in succession, it would yield committers me (I merged pinctrl-dove
into pinctrl), you, Torvalds.

Well, if the code is perfect, we don't have to worry about a lazy
developer bisecting down to one of our commits. ;-)

btw - I have one last pull request I'll be sending tomorrow that's a
couple of commits on top of what you currently have.  It's very small,
but we're avoiding locking ourselves into supporting a bad DT ABI.  The
real code change just downgrades a WARN().  The rest is correcting the
binding doc.

thx,

Jason.
