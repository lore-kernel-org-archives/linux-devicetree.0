Hi,

just a ping:

Are we really OK with breaking existing DTs in 4.6? (per the code in
-next: f7d372ba54ea04d528a291b8dbe34716507bb60b, which is this patch).

Also I think one needs ACKs from DT maintainers before merging something
in the respective directories, which I don't see here.

As I am somewhat blocked on that patch, I'd like to have some discussion
on the list.

Thanks,
Andre.
