These correspond to PRU events. It is true that most likely they will
never be used for peripheral DMA and can be dedicated as memcpy
channels. However, since this is being encoded in DT, we need to be sure
that they will never be used for peripheral DMA on this board.

So, I would prefer if you do not reserve any channels for memcpy until
there is a real need/usecase for them. I know the board file has these
reserved but board file could be updated as you liked. With DT we need
to maintain backward compatibility. So I would rather do it when there
is an actual need for it.

In future, if/when we gain QDMA support, the QDMA channels could be used
for memcopy.

Same here. I would drop this.
