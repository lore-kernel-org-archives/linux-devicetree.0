This I don't know, but we can probably assume it's the case.

Right. But for existing notifier chains, the existence, semantic and
meaning of the parameters are already defined, and the gazillions users
of that notifier chain in the kernel rely on those parameters to not
change.

Are we talking about  the reboot_notifier_list, implemented by
kernel/reboot.c? It seems to me it's used to let drivers know that they
should quiesce all DMA transfers and things like that before doing a
shutdown. It's also tied to the system states that are defined in
<linux/kernel.h> :

/* Values used for system_state */
extern enum system_states {
        SYSTEM_BOOTING,
        SYSTEM_RUNNING,
        SYSTEM_HALT,
        SYSTEM_POWER_OFF,
        SYSTEM_RESTART,
} system_state;

Is it really reasonable to add one more state here? I can certainly
draft something, but it looks like a lot of core kernel changes which I
believe have a very small chance of getting accepted.

I'm really trying to understand better what you suggest, and see how it
can work for our situation, but for now, it's not very clear to me how
that would work.

Thanks,

Thomas
