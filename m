I gave this a good think while I have been working on this series
and I came to the conclusion that we really don't need to do this.
These components are all internal to the PLL IP block, so the
compatible string is enough to tell us what we have. They only
thing we need really in the device tree bindings are the connections
that are external to the IP block.

So, the full device tree binding would look something like this:

+
+	pll0: clock-controller@11000 {
+		compatible = "ti,da850-pll0";
+		reg = <0x11000 0x1000>;
+		clocks = <&ref_clk>, <&pll1_sysclk 3>, <&pll1_obsclk>;
+		clock-names = "oscin", pll1_sysclk3", "pll1_osbclk";
+		oscin-square-wave;
+
+		pll0_sysclk: sysclk {
+			#clock-cells = <1>;
+		};
+
+		pll0_auxclk: auxclk {
+			#clock-cells = <0>;
+		};
+
+		pll0_div45: div4.5 {
+			#clock-cells = <0>;
+		};
+
+		pll0_obsclk: obsclk {
+			#clock-cells = <0>;
+			assigned-clocks = <&pll0_sysclk 1>;
+			assigned-clock-names = "ocsrc";
+		};
+	};

There are three clocks coming into the IP block and there are 11 clocks
going out (sysclk is 7 clocks). And you can specify the board-specific
configuration, like having the "oscin-square-wave" flag when a square wave
is used instead of a crystal oscillator and you can assign the multiplexer
input that will be used by obsclk. (And, this binding is totally compatible
with the binding I have already proposed - although, I see now it would
be better to go ahead and add the clocks-names property.)

How everything connects together is all implemented in the driver and the
driver will be able to know what to do just by looking at the compatible
string.

Part of my motivation for doing things this way comes from my recent
experience with writing some bindings for some LCD panels. These
device tree bindings were notorious for trying to be one-size-fits
all will lots of properties to try to describe all of the internal
workings. And it turns out that just having a new compatible string
for each device or variant and pushing all of details of the quirks
into the driver is much simpler and cleaner and will make it easier
for other projects to reuse the bindings.
