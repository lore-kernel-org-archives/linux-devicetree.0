I think this is a reasonable approach. Maybe this should be a CONFIG 
option that disallows pinctrl drivers (and power domain later) to be =m? 
Then by default we could force those drivers to be compiled in, but if 
you really wanted to do kernel modules for pinctrl/pd you'd consciously 
potentially lose forward compatibility.
