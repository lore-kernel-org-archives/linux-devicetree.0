It seems the OV5640 driver never puts its the CSI-2 lanes into stop
state while not streaming. With the recent s_stream reordering,
streaming from TC358743 does not work anymore, since imx6-mipi-csi2
s_stream is called before tc358743 s_stream, while all lanes are still
in stop state. Then it waits for the clock lane to become active and
fails. I have applied the following patch to revert the reordering
locally to get it to work again.

The initialization order, as Russell pointed out, should be:

1. reset the D-PHY.
2. place MIPI sensor in LP-11 state
3. perform D-PHY initialisation
4. configure CSI2 lanes and de-assert resets and shutdown signals

So csi2_s_stream should wait for stop state on all lanes (the result of
2.) before dphy_init (3.), not wait for active clock afterwards. That
should happen only after sensor_s_stream was called. So unless we are
allowed to reorder steps 1. and 2., we might need the prepare_stream
callback after all.

More specifically, the chapter 40.3.1 "Startup Sequence" in the i.MX6DQ
reference manual states:

1. Deassert presetn signal (global reset)
   - This is probably the APB global reset, so not something we have to
     care about.
2. Configure MIPI Camera Sensor to put all Tx lanes in PL-11 state
3. D-PHY initialization (write 0x14 to address 0x44)
4. CSI2 Controller programming
   - Set N_LANES
   - Deassert PHY_SHUTDOWNZ
   - Deassert PHY_RSTZ
   - Deassert CSI2_RESETN
5. Read the PHY status register (PHY_STATE) to confirm that all data and
   clock lanes of the D-PHY are in Stop State
6. Configure the MIPI Camera Sensor to start transmitting a clock on the
   D-PHY clock lane
7. CSI2 Controller programming - Read the PHY status register
   (PHY_STATE) to confirm that the D-PHY is receiving a clock on the
   D-PHY clock lane

2. can be done in sensor s_power (which tc358743 currently does) only if
the sensor can still be configured in step 6.
Also, 3./4./5. are csi2 code, 6. is sensor code, and 7. is csi2 code
again. For reliable startup we need csi2 receiver code to be called on
both sides of the sensor enabling its clock lane.

Subject: [PATCH] media: imx: revert streamon sequence change

Without this patch, starting streaming from a TC358743 MIPI CSI-2 source
fails with the following error messages:

    imx6-mipi-csi2: clock lane timeout, phy_state = 0x000006f0
    ipu1_csi0: pipeline_set_stream failed with -110

The phy state above has the stopstateclk, rxulpsclknot, and
stopstatedata[3:0] bits set: at this point all lanes are in stop state,
no lane is in ultra low power state or active.
This is no suprise, since tc358743 s_stream(sd, 1) has not been called
due to the recently changed ordering. The imx6-mipi-csi2 s_stream does
wait for the clock lane to become active, so csi2_s_stream must happen
after tc358743_s_stream.
