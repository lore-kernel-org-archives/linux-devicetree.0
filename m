How about the example of always on voice in Android, which can be enabled and
disabled, depending on user settings, and routing will vary depending on which
mic is in use at the time? For the levelling is it not plausible that a user
could configure the level based on their current environment. You have
moderately loud background noise, then your threshold would want to be
higher, but in a quiet environment the likelihood is you would want to lower
that threshold?
