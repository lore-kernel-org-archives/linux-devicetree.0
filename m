Will move into the driver code.

I was using the device tree to set some board specific properties of our 
audio serial port driver. The idea was that these properties would only 
need to be one value for a specific board.  Therefore, we could set them 
in the device tree and then not have to set them in the
machine file. I thought it would help keep the machine file
a little more basic.  Moving these to the machine file is reasonable and 
will allow for a more dynamic usage of our driver.  I will move them to 
machine file.

Okay. Will replace with "status"

It is a configuration where we can link together two or three of the 
ports to allow for synchronized starts and stop. I will look into 
another method of configuring this operational mode.
