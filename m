Thank you, I set it.

This hardware has 2 types of HW SRC. First type sit before audio port and
cannot change routing. I use it in this driver. Second type is like a loopback,
but this block is not used in this driver to simplify the first version.

Type 1:
  Mem -> DMA -> SRC -> Out Port -> External pin
Type 2:
  Mem -> DMA -> SRC -> Out Port -> In Port -> DMA -> Mem

Sorry... I agree your opinion, but I can't imagine the detail.

I think my driver has structure as follows (ex. startup):
  DAI: uniphier_aio_startup()@aio-core.c
  Lib: uniphier_aio_init()@aio-regctrl.c
  SoC specific: uniphier_aio_ld11_spec@aio-ld11.c

Am I wrong? Would you mean split the functions in aio-regctl.[ch] to other
kernel module? I wonder if you could tell me the example from existing
drivers. I'll try to fix my driver like as it.

Yes, indeed. This hardware is more flexible and complex, but now I (and our
company) don't use it. Of course, I don't want to hide some features of this
hardware from ALSA people. I should try to upstream all features in the future,
I think.
