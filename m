Do note that the existing DTs must work with any new kernel update; 
that's part of DT being an ABI. So, there should be no need to update 
any of the existing DTs. Rather, the driver must cope with missing 
properties and operate as best it can. Perhaps that means that even if 
dr_mode is unspecified and hence defaults to otg, then if properties 
that are mandatory for OTG to operate are missing, the driver falls back 
to host mode. I think that'd be completely backwards-compatible?

3 DT files, with an appropriate one of those included in each RPi DT, 
sounds reasonable.

That's probably OK; in this patch the properties for those modes are in 
a comment too, so essentially unreferenced. Perhaps on RPi platforms 
where a choice is possible (Zero, A), there could be a comment next to 
the include of the "host" or "otg" version that states the user might 
want to edit the DT and include the other version instead. Then, those 
files would be somewhat referenced.
