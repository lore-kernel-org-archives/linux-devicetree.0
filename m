Thankyou for reviewing v2 patchset, here is v3 addressing comments from v2.

Qualcomm WCD9335 Codec is a standalone Hi-Fi audio codec IC.
It is integrated in multiple Qualcomm SoCs like: MSM8996, MSM8976,
and MSM8956 chipsets.

WCD9335 had multiple functional blocks, like: Soundwire controller,
interrupt mux, pin controller, Audio codec, MBHC, MAD(Mic activity Detection),
Ultrasonic proximity and pen detection, Battery-voltage monitoring and
Codec processing engine.

Currently this patchset has been only tested with SLIMbus interface due
to hardware avaiablity, but it can be easily made to work with both SLIMbus
and I2C/I2S.    

This patchset adds very basic playback and capture support witout much
fancy features. New features will be added once the basic support is in.
This patchset is tested on top of linux-next on DB820c for both playback
, capture paths and MBHC.

Some parts of the code has been inherited from Qualcomm andriod kernel,
so credits to various authors.

WCD9335 can be interfaced via I2S/I2C or SLIMbus. 

Here is my test branch incase someone want to try this out:

Thanks,
