I can't parse this last sentence. What exactly is inline with the SMCCC?

AFAICT, the SMCCC says r12 is "The Intra-Procedure-call scratch
register", which is not a paramter, service ID, etc.

So IIUC, you have a secure monitor which is not SMCCC compliant, but you
want to use it at the same time as OP-TEE, which is SMCCC compliant.

It would be much better to have a new version of that monitor that was
SMCCC compliant, and have to update the code for that, than to have to
move OP-TEE away from standards compliance.

So you're going to describe OP-TEE as present even when it's not!?

That's simply wrong.

AFAICT this means that OP-TEE completely replaces your existing monitor.

Please fix this properly. Implement SMCCC-compliant versions of those
calls you wish to retain, and come up with a new binding for those.
Describe that in the DT for systems which have OP-TEE providing these
services.

Systems with the old monitor should have that descrbied in their DT, and
not OP-TEE.

That completely removes the need to come up with a new OP-TEE binding
extension, and aligns your FW for forward compatibility with future
services.

Thanks,
Mark.
