I'd recommend viewing the documentation in its post-processed version,
because then you get the examples as pictures, and they say that a
picture is worth 1000 words.  See

  https://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/uapi/v4l/dev-subdev.html

There is almost an exact example of what we're trying to do - it's
figure 4.6.  Here, we have a sink pad with a cropping rectangle on
the input, which is then scaled to a composition rectangle (there's
no bounds rectangle, and it's specified that in such a case the
top,left of the composition rectangle will always be 0,0 - see quote
below).

Where it differs is that the example also supports source cropping
for two source pads.  We don't support that.

The same document says:

  Scaling support is optional. When supported by a subdev, the crop
  rectangle on the subdev's sink pad is scaled to the size configured
  using the
  :ref:`VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_SELECTION <VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_SELECTION>` IOCTL
  using ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE`` selection target on the same pad. If the
  subdev supports scaling but not composing, the top and left values are
  not used and must always be set to zero.

which in itself describes _exactly_ our hardware here as far as the
cropping and scaling the hardware supports.

This isn't how I read it.  Scaling is the relationship between the size
of the sink crop and sink compose rectangle.  Composition requires that
there be a composition bounds rectangle to define the composition space,
and the top,left of the composition rectangle be adjustable to place
the composition rectangle within that space.

The above quoted paragraph from the documentation backs up my view in
its final sentence - it doesn't say "if the subdev supports scaling
but not composing, there is no composition rectangle" but says that
there _is_ one but its top,left coordinates are always zero.
