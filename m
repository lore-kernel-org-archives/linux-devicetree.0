Hello,

Based on earlier work of mine for the LeMaker Guitar, this series adds initial
support for the Actions Semiconductor S500 (ARMv7) and S900 (ARMv8) SoCs.

Despite Actions Semi being a Linaro member since 2015, sadly I have not seen
a single upstream kernel patch submission since. Nor has the XApple community
taken any such initiative.

The GitHub LeMaker/linux-actions and xapp-le/kernel trees have 3.10 based S500
drivers in arch/arm/mach-owl/, whereas the 96boards-bubblegum/linux tree has
new-style but still 3.10 based S900 drivers. I also spotted GPLv2+ vs. GPLv2
license differences.

This series therefore provides a proof of concept for a combined S500 and S900
mainline implementation. Only earlycon serial output is available for now.

Focusing on Bubblegum-96, no S500 clocksource implementation is provided yet,
thus output on Guitar is less than on Bubblegum-96, but still it demonstrates
that a single driver can be shared for both, using compatible strings for
future differentiation.

Booting from U-Boot is straightforward on both boards.

Have a lot of fun!

Cheers,
Andreas
