And in slave cases, you can use slave config to pass the values which are
required, so we dont need this custome interface!

beacuse you are messing with APIs. SPI will be slave where we know how to
program the values!

Some of those cases are treated as slave for obvious reasons.

Please check existing solutions before inventing new ones. Everyone thinks
that their hardware and thereby driver is a novel case, but on closer
inspection that is usually not the case, different falvour yes, novel no!

Okay I am convince now this is not right approach. Please remove this
custom interface and then implement slave for required slave scenarios!
