OK, everything moved over to boot/dts folder, boot/dtb nuked, although latter
seemed a clean approach - specially given that some arches have billions of source
files in them - anyways not a big worry for ARC port.

How does the equivalent of following look like:

diff --git a/arch/arc/boot/dts/Makefile b/arch/arc/boot/dts/Makefile

One observation above is that the explicitly build dtb file (make ARCH=arc
angel4.dtb) doesn't get cleaned with make {clean,distclean} despite above
clean-files and this is true even for orig version.

So you mean rename arc/arc/boot/dts/skeleton.dts to arch/arc/boot/dts/generic.dts
as that's what the semantics are here. I agree.

However I think skeleton semantics are better: I'll take out the specific boards
name from it, and for empty CONFIG_ARC_BUILTIN_DTB_NAME, include a real board DT
file rather than skeleton. OK ?

Yes, ARC port currently doesn't handle the cmdline provided by DT - given that I
added the the DT support itself very recently. I plan to fix this soon, but assume
it not absolutely must in terms of requirements.

Ditto !

Many thanks for your review.
