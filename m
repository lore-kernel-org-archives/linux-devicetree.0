Why would you need a different compatible string?
Can't you use soc_device_match() to handle ES1.x SoCs?

The different DU <-> VSPD topology is handled through the vsps property in DTS.
Are the ports different, too? That can be handled in DTS.

The main reason why I kept the DU node in r8a7795.dtsi is that the board DTS
refers to it.  Sharing board DTS means there needs to be at least a
placeholder node for the DU in r8a7795.dtsi, unless you want to keep on
shuffling board overrides around.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
