This series adds infrastructure for generating platform and amba
devices based on device tree data.  I intend to queue up this series
for the v3.1 merge window.  I had already posted these patches earlier
in the "Full device tree support for ARM Versatile" RFC series.  They
haven't changed since I posted that.

Unless I hear otherwise, I'll put the first 4 patches into
devicetree/next later this week.  The fifth patch can either go via
devicetree/next or benh's powerpc tree (your choice Ben).

Grant Likely (5):
      dt: Add default match table for bus ids
      dt: add of_platform_populate() for creating device from the device tree
      drivers/amba: create devices from device tree
      dt/platform: allow device name to be overridden
      powerpc/5200: convert mpc5200 to use of_platform_populate()
