You will also have to add an appropriate 'ranges' property then.

That would also be possible, just put the register numbers into your 'st,syscfg'
property after the phandle, and leave the reg property empty then.

There should at most be one 'reg' address space, so put it under the node whose
bus these refer to. Put all offsets that are relative to a syscon link into
the phandle that refers to the syscon device, or hardcode the offsets in the
driver.

You can do 1 or 2, not 3.
