Russell,

There is a chicken bit in the IOMUXC GPR1 (IOMUXC+0x4 bit 21, it's on
page 1927 of the i.MX6DQRM Rev 1 04/2013) which turns on or off the
ENET_REF_CLK loopback. You could need to clear it to make the pad an
input to the i.MX6 rather than an output to the PHY.. while it may
seem like this removes the need for the SION bit in the pin you want,
that's actually also required otherwise the pad mux latch 'sees' the
data but the input latch behind it doesn't.

There is a great diagram somewhere in the manual (Figure 28-1, right
at the top of the GPIO docs) - SION *forces* data (it's the input_on
signal in the diagram IIRC) to the gpio data register behind the
IOMUX, but the logic behind every muxed pad is almost the same across
the SoC.

In essence, the pad control setting needs to be correct (SION set) and
that chicken bit correctly cleared, or the clock input never goes into
the MAC, because the MAC isn't connected directly to the pad, it's
connected to the input latch. The only logic block that can 'really'
read the pad latch is the GPIO unit.

Note that you MAY have to cycle the clock or reset the PHY or MAC
*after* setting the pin up, otherwise the MAC won't get the clock..
it's really a laborious process which isn't described properly in the
DT (all it needs is a property to define where it's clock comes from
and Do The Right Thing (tm) at driver init.. because this is
infuriatingly common on i.MX6 designs, but not so common that everyone
needs it)
