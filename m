The reason for choosing the two partitions like the way you do is not
because "LCDK ships with as is", but because:

a) LCDK cannot book from block 0 (needs a different boot mode)

b) Block 0 is guaranteed to be good and capable of ~1000 erase cycles on
most NANDs so using it to store environment variables makes sense.
Especially on development boards where environment might be updated
frequently during course of usage. Coupled with the fact that U-Boot
does not implement any sort of wear-leveling on environment block (AFAIK).

c) If block 0 is dedicated to env, block 1 is the next logical block to
be used for u-boot.ais

d) rest of the space is left to be used as the user deems fit.

I still disagree with any references to legacy software that ships with
LCDK. The partitioning scheme is used because it makes most sense. Not
because the board ships with it.

Thanks,
Sekhar
