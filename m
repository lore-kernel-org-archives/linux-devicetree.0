Possibly, this stuff is all system jargon heavy and I've not context
switched that in recently.  The above sounds like it pretty much *is*
the equivalent of pulse skipping in which case it's much more like the
normal modes (that we were going to abandon...).

This definitely sounds like traditional regulator modes.

Yes.

Yeah, if it's becoming something that does need setting from DT (which
it seems to) then we probably need to go through all that.  With helpers
and so on.

Yes, that was what I was thinking.  Perhaps a current-limit or something
property rather than the min and max thing for clarity (to avoid
confusion with actual current regulators).

Hardware engineers are truly innovative and creative people sometimes.
That all makes sense, but the thing about the generic names still
applies - at least namespace them please.
