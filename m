Why?

Normally, the file_operations will be associated with the module which,
in this case, called misc_register() - the same module which contains
the remove function.

So, the text for the remove function will still be available.  The data
for the remove function will also be available, because we haven't
kref_put()'d the last reference yet.

So, where's the problem?

Right - the problem here is that a sysfs file attached to the class
device inside miscdev could be open at the point we want to free the
tee structures - and the lifetime of the miscdev class device is
unrelated to the lifetime of the tee structure.

For a device attribute attached to that class device, the lifetime
of the class device will be controlled by the sysfs file being open.

The problem comes when you want to try to get at some private data
(in this case, the tee private data) from that class device.  The class
device has no driver data set.  So, people may be tempted to use
dev->parent to grab the parent device's private data - and that's
dangerous, because after device_destroy() in misc_deregister(),
nothing guarantees that the class device's parent pointer remains
valid.

So, attaching attributes to the class device is _really_ a no-go.
The attributes should be attached to the parent device - the device
which is actually being driven.

The second option is to attach them to the struct device for the
device being driven.  That has all the standard rules which come
from drivers attaching attributes to the struct device for which
they're driving, so that should be nothing new to anyone.

If that's hard to get right, then we have an error in the design of
the driver model - such stuff should be _easy_ to get right.  For
example, the driver model should guarantee that when a driver
attribute is removed from a struct device, its method won't be
called any further (if it doesn't do this, I suspect we have a fair
number of buggy drivers...)
