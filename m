Subject: [PATCH v4 00/15] Add support for MSM's mmio clock/reset controller

The first breaks a reset-controller include ordering requirement. I hope it can
go through the clock tree.

The next 3 patches are generic clock framework patches. They add support for
regmap and for setting the rate and the parent at the same time based on
patches from James Hogan's remuxing set_rate series.

After that we add MSM clock hardware support and SoC specific drivers. The DT
node additions will be sent through the MSM maintainers once these patches are
accepted.

Changes since v3:
 * Moved binding include to clock/
 * New patch for 8660 GCC driver
 * Renamed directory to qcom to match vendor prefix
 * Added some missing clocks in 8974 GCC driver
 * New patch for 8974 MMCC driver

Changes since v2:

 * Completed 8960 and 8974 GCC data & dt-bindings
 * Added support for reset controllers
 * Squashed some bugs in 8974 gcc clocks
 * New patch to fix clk NULL pointer deref
 * New patch to fix #include requirement for reset-controller.h

Changes since v1:

 * Rewrote binding to use #clock-cells=1
 * Reworked library components (pll, rcg, branch) to use regmap
 * Dropped common clock framework patches that did DT parsing
 * New patches for regmap support in common clock framework
