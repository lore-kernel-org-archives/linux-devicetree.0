It looks that my proposal for the reserved memory nodes causes much more
controversy than I expected when I've sent a pull request to Linus:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/15/151
http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg273548.html

Fixing those issues requires further discussion. Frankly, right now I
really have no idea which way should I go. The /reserved-ranges node seems
to be easy to match particular reserved memory region with a given device.
I'm also not really convinced if it makes sense to add a code for finding
and matching a reserved memory region to every device driver, which might
need it. I would really like to get some more feedback on the Ben's
comment.

In any case, the code will also change significantly, so I assume that the
best, what can be done now is to revert the current version and start from
the scratch with a new, complete proposal.

Best regards
