See:
[PATCH V4 7/7] clk: bcm2835: apply limits on dividers to MASH mode.
That "downgrades" to lower mash values in case we are out of range.
Also note that it applies to MASH=1 as well.

If the other (non mash-supported) clocks support this "better" (if it 
works), then we can make that change only apply to mash enabled clocks.
But so far I doubt it works correctly so I have applied those limits to
all clocks.
