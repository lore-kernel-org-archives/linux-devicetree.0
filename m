so here is my suspicion. By default the hci_bcm driver tries to enable an UART operational speed of 4000000. However this hardware does not support it and it does not even support the required command to change the clock. That is why things do not work properly with the hci_bcm driver and btattach. I assume that is why you added max-speed 921600 for the serdev support. What I can figure out that a speed up-to 3000000 (as in some of the hciattach examples) will actually work since that doesn’t use the UART Clock setting to change the clock type.

So I wonder if using an oper_speed = 4000000 as default is actually a good idea. Maybe we should only do that if we have found a matching ACPI entry. Or if we get a max-speed entry from DT. Otherwise actually default to 115200.

We also really need to convert the ACPI support to use serdev as well. At least the standard tables list them as BTH0 which we could use to identify them as Bluetooth devices. Or we just need to do it based on the _HID string.

Regards

Marcel
