Then what does the word 'groups' in Dong's sentence means with your
understanding, considering there is no HW level pingroup on imx?

IMO, it's a compromise.  It still makes sense to have concept of
pingroup in pinctrl subsystem, because platforms like Tegra have
the HW pingroup.

In this case, I do not see any point to define them, since it does not
make too much difference than integer 0, 1, ..., 7.
