I'm deeply sorry for the very late complaint on this, but I only now
noticed this patch as I was seeing build breakage in linux-next
because of it.

The build bug is not the problem however, but the abuse of the
API is. Andy, are you sure you understood what this does when
you gave you Reviewed-by comment?

Viresh, there are multiple problems with your approach unfortunately:

* It does not follow the binding from
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt

* It requires slave drivers to know that they are using the dw_dmac
  driver and pass a pointer to dw_generic_filter, which is not
  generic at all

* It requires the dmac node to have information about all slaves

There are also some minor issues, such as the naming of DT
properties, but the above need to be resolved first.
