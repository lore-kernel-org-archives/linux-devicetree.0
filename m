Then they can try, but they will rightfully get nack'd and told to stop
using board files and use DT/ACPI. Most upstream architectures don't use
board files anymore anyway, so I doubt this will ever happen.

Besides, if they haven't upstreamed their code then it is their problem
if this patch breaks them, we shouldn't hold up upstream work for
out-of-tree code, especially theoretical out-of-tree code that will
never exist.
