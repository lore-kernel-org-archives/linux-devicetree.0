I would have one node per chip-select and then put the devices on
that CS below it, with #address-cells=1 again.

No, better put the settings into one device per cs.

Nothing wrong with having a hierarchy here, what I'm interested
in is making the addressing reflect what the hardware actually
does. With the empty "ranges", it looks like the entire 32-bit
address is getting exposed to the external bus, which is usually
not how things work: instead, each "cs" line gets raised by an I/O
operation on a particular CPU address range, and that range should
be part of the "ranges" propert of the main bus node, and the
externally visible addresses should be the translated addresses
in the child bus representation in DT.
