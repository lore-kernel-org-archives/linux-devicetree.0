Hmmm...  I misunderstood then.  I don't agree that this is the best way for=
ward.

Doing it this way means a non-compatible break in the interface.  It
means that the bootloader needs to know what interface the kernel is
expecting for boot; information that is not readily available from the
image type.  The user then needs to tell the boot loader which
interface to use rather than a backwards compatible addition of a blob
of data.

You mention below "shifting the World Order on ARM" and it creating
resistance for merging DT support.  Isn't this much the same thing as
it creates a non backwards compatible change in the way bootloaders
pass data to the kernel.  The cutover in powerpc from the old
interface to the new caused no end of confusion and people who could
no longer get their systems to boot.  On PowerPC is was necessary
because the old method was completely broken, but ATAGs are clean,
simple and well implemented.

It also means teaching every boot loader two separate methods for
booting and exposing those differences to the user.
