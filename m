Ok, practically it should work for my purposes, but the change must be
done along with added EMC device node description.

I'm not so confident that it is correct to add description of static
memory banks to ahb node though, please give me a short confirmation,
then I'll send a change for inclusion of EMC description -- the one
above excluding clocks and clock-names properties, work on CCF is in
progress.
