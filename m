Please explain this statement.

The point is arm_dma_limit is that it sets the limit of the memory you
get from the page allocators when you ask for a GFP_DMA allocation.

In the case of no GFP_DMA zone, all memory is available for allocations.
Hence, arm_dma_limit is set to the absolute maximum physical memory
address which an allocator could return.

In the case of a 32-bit only system, this is 32-bits.  In the case of a
LPAE system, it is 64-bit.  (This follows because arm_dma_limit is
phys_addr_t, and the size of this follows the bit size of the system.)

The only questionable case is where we have a LPAE system with a GFP_DMA
zone and arm_dma_limit is set to 0xfffffffff - this limit is probably
too low.

Now the reason for the arm_dma_limit is very simple: if the streaming
APIs are passed a buffer outside of the DMA mask, we must reallocate
that memory.  We must have a way to get memory which is within the DMA
mask.  That's what passing GFP_DMA does.  If you have no GFP_DMA zone,
then any memory could be returned.  In the case of a LPAE system with
memory both above and below the 32-bit address range, and you try to
allocate a buffer which happens to be above the 32-bit boundary, what
do you do?  Do you just retry the allocation and hope for the best?
What if that allocation also came out above the 32-bit boundary?  Do
you continue gobbling up system memory until you get a page which you
can DMA do and then free all those buffers you unsuccesfully obtained?

We have a massive problem with DMA masks in the Linux kernel, because
of the x86-ism of assuming that physical memory always starts at
address zero.  This assumption simply is not true on ARM, even more so
with LPAE, which is why people are starting to see a problem.

Consider this case: you have an existing 32-bit DMA controller.  This
controller sets a 32-bit DMA mask, because that's all it is capable of
addressing.  It gets used on 32-bit systems, and it works fine.

It gets put onto a LPAE system where memory starts at the 4GB boundary.
The DMA controller can address the first 4GB of memory because that's
how it's wired up.  The DMA controller still has a 32-bit DMA mask
because as far as the DMA controller is concerned, nothing has changed.
But now things fail because the kernel assumes that a DMA mask is
something to do with a physical address.

The solution to this is to fix the DMA masks and such like.  The problem
is getting the traction throughout the architectures, drivers, subsystem
maintainers etc to accept a change - and working out a way to do the
change without causing a lot of breakage.
