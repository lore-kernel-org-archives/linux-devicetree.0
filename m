Ah, very good. Extending this one function should be fairly straightforward,
just discuss with the PTP maintainer how to best do it.

In each case, it might be better to add a new ioctl command instead, if
the existing command does not fit perfectly. This again would be up to
Richard.

Seems reasonable, or again you could add a new command with 
a different structure if Richard prefers that.

Would it help if you register each channel as a separate ptp clock? That
way you could open them separately from user space in order to just
read from one of them.
