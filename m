In a TCB (Timer Counter Block) you have 3 TC (Timer Counters). Each
timer can take a regular clock (+a divider) as a source, but it can
also take the output of the previous channel (so channel 1 can take
the output of channel 0, channel 2 the output of channel 1, and channel
0 the output of channel 2). A TC output can be configured to toggle
every time the counter overflows. So when you chain 2 channels, you
double the number of bits of your counter. This is particularly
interesting if you want to create a precise timer that has an
acceptable wraparound period, otherwise, you'll have to choose between
a timer with a poor precision and an acceptable wraparound period, and
a timer with a good precision and a small wraparound.

Actually, the problem had already been solved with the "atmel,tcb-timer"
compatible. When this compatible is used we know the TC(s) can be used
as generic timers. If you want to reserve TC(s) for other usage (like a
PWM), you just leave the TC undefined in the device tree and an overlay
can add a new node reserving this TC afterwards. This approach has
already been accepted by Rob [1].

So right now, the problem we have is how to assign a specific timer to
a clockevent or clocksource 'device'.
