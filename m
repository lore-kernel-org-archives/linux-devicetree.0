This patchset adds driver for HiSilicon Hi6421v530 PMIC.

Mainline kernel already has driver support to a similar chip, Hi6421.
Hi6421 and Hi6421v530 are both from the same vendor, HiSilicon, but
they are at different revisions. They both use the same Memory-mapped
I/O method to communicate with Main SoC. However, they differ quite a
lot in their regulator designs. Eg. they have completely different LDO
voltage points.

Patch 1 and 2 are hi6421-pmic cleaning up.
Patch 3 and 4 extends hi6421-pmic-core.c to support Hi6421v530 revision.
Patch 5 add hi6421v530-regulator.c driver for LDO regulators.
Patch 6 fixes an issue for hi6421 regulator, which is not related to v530
         but it's found in this review.
Patch 7 is dts change, it depends on and can be applied to hi3660/hikey960
        patchset [1].
Patch 8 enables the relevant config items.

Major changes in v6:
 - Patch 5, solve review comments from Mark Brown, add hi6421v530 regulator
     driver to module device table.
 - Add Acked-by from Arnd Bergmann

Major changes in v5:
 - Patch 3, solve review comments from Lee Johes

Major changes in v4:
 - put hi6421-pmic cleanup in separate patches.
 - solve review comments from Lee Johes.
 - regulator-name should not have '/' character. Otherwise it "Failed to
     create debugfs directory"

Major changes in v3:
 - in hi6421-pmic-core.c
    * use shorter license script.
    * arrange #include in alphabetical order.
    * using recommended error log messages from Lee Jones.
 - in hi6421v530-regulator.c
    * remove unused #include files
    * arrange remaining ones in alphabetical order.

Major changes in v2:
 - instead of writing a new driver, extend hi6421-pmic-core.c
     to support its v530 revision
 - update hi6421v530-regulator.c to use modern regulator driver
     design logics.
