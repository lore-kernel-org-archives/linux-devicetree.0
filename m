I was confused by the previous version of the patch, and asked Shengjiu
to improve the commit log, which seems still not so good.  In short, the
patch does add a missing clock, and the missing of the clock is
discovered by a low-power-mode issue when SPDIF driver is enabled.

Right, should have reminded him.  I will keep my eyes more closely on
this.
