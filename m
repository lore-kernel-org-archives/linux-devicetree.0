There is also the usecase of keep clocks on until I load a module that
properly handles my hardware (e.g simplefb). We have a simplefb node
with clocks and the simplefb driver jumps thru some hoops to hand-off
clocks to the real driver. I don't really like it and don't want to
see more examples. And there is the case of I thought I would never
manage this clock, but kernel subsystems evolve and now I want to
manage a clock. This should not require a DT update to do so.

Neither of these may be Lee's usecase, but I want to see them covered
by the binding.

I would prefer to see the always on clocks just listed within the
clock controller's node rather than creating made up nodes with clock
properties. This should be always-on until claimed IMO, but that
aspect is the OS's problem, not a DT problem.
