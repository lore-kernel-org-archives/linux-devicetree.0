I completely agree with Dave.
I have no problems adding a symbolic property to say "we are using hvc
with parameters on registers". I just want to avoid having actual
machine instructions (and potentially dealing with executing them) into
the DT.

Maybe we could have a "calling-convention" property that can be "xen"
or something else. When a new hypervisor vendor comes along it can
change the value of "calling-convention" to "foo".
