Guess I need to be --verbose. ;)

I meant: After patch 1/3 there is a gx-common.dtsi that duplicates
contents of gxbb.dtsi and is not yet #include'd anywhere, i.e., unused.

I'm suggesting we do "atomic" move operations, not copy and then remove.

The difference between my two suggestions is how many and which changes
we squash - I do appreciate that it's easy for review as is but what I
have in mind is that either we should get this refactoring applied asap
(#1 1)) and rebase all pending patches on it, or we may need to rebase
the refactoring onto any pending MMC, SDIO, etc. patches, which I feel
is safer to do in one big patch (#2 2)) than split over multiple ones.
It really depends on the merge order and roadmap you guys have in mind.

Hm, GXTVB would still be longer than GXL then, not much point then.
We could still do -gxbb-s905 though.
