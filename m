I'd rather it match the docs.  I personally have no idea for why the
writer of the docs used "vdd" vs. "vin", but even if they had no good
reason matching the docs makes this searchable.

As far as the "_" to "-", Rob asked for that earlier in this thread
and you says "I will change this on the next patch set."  In general
the desire to convert "_" to "-" makes this less searchable (since the
docs use "_"), but that's the way device tree guys want it so so c'est
la vie.  Luckily it's easily to mentally change the "-"s back to "_"s
when searching...
