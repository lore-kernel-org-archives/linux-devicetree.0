Hello Alan and Arnd

I wanted to follow up on this patch and ascertain what I would have to

Arnd, should I re patch the ehci-platform driver to avoid phy-names 
entirely? Alan, if not do you have an opinion on what the usb phy names 
should be? The current patch uses "usbp" + port number such as "usbp0" , 
"usbp1" etc

Arnd do you have any other comments on the phy driver itself? Thank you
