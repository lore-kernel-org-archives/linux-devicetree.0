I only want to apply this to identical controller banks. For example
the lpc31xx has 12 identical banks of 32 bits.  You can program all
384 of these locations identically, but only about 100 locations are
actually hooked to real hardware.

We could add something like this to the device tree for gpio-controller=
:
gpios-valid =3D <0x1234 0x1234 0x1234 0x1234 0x1234 0x1234 0x1234 0x123=
4 ...>
12 groups of bits indicating which gpios are valid.

Or we could just ignore the invalid bits. On the lpc31xx they all
work, just just don't do anything.

I agree that if the structure of the GPIO banks is irregular they
should be different gpiochips.
