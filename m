Do you mean to have 2 DT bindings?

This binding is used from 2011-07.
It means it was generated for all hw designs at least from this time.
I would say from DT usage on Microblaze because it is not special case
in our dt generator.

xlnx,XXX are XXX parameters which you have to setup in tools
and get synthesized. This is valid for all xilinx IPs. We have full
IP description by generating xlnx,XXX parameters directly from tools
because we know all variants which can happen.

Just back to your previous post:
"I'm not sure about the enable-once flag, which seems to just map to the
"nowayout" watchdog option that is not a hardware feature at all"
this is hw feature which you can select in tools because this is fpga. :-)

Thanks,
Michal
