This is where _not_ relying on the most up to date ARM architecture
reference manual, but instead referring back to the ARM architecture
manual revision appropriate to the architecture is a far better plan.

For example, DDI0100E, Part B, 2.3.2:

| 2.3.2 Cache Type register
| If present, the Cache Type register supplies the following details about
| the cache:

Note the "if present" - it's a fact that not all ARMv4 CPUs support this
register.  2.3 also tells you how to detect when these registers are
implemented:

| ID registers other than the main ID register are defined so that when
| implemented, their value cannot be equal to that of the main ID register.
| Software can therefore determine whether they exist by reading both
| the main ID register and the desired register and comparing their values.
| If the two values are not equal, the desired register exists.

I can go back further to one of the initial revisions of the ARM ARM,
but that's a paper copy.

I can also refer you to DDI0087E (ARM720T) section 4.3 - this is an
ARMv4T CPU, and it has no cache type register.  StrongARM is another
example where the CTR is not implemented.

in database were 13.1 to 19Mbit for a good line, about 7.5+ for a bad.
Estimate before purchase was "up to 13.2Mbit".
