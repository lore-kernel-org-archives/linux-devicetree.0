Remove empty funnctions, -ENOTSUPP is expected behaviour for anything
that isn't explicitly supported by a driver.

unlikely() is for optimising hot paths, just write the logic clearly
unless there's a reason for it.

No, this is completely broken.  Whatever is going on in your system with
the interrupt core you need to address that at the appropriate level not
by putting a nonsensical bodge in here.  The interrupt is disabled while
the threaded handler is running, if that's not having the desired effect
then whatever causes that needs to be fixed.

I don't understand this.  Why on earth would we be calling the PMU
handler if the widget was not previously powered?=20

This is a _POST_PMU handler not a pre-PMU handler...

Oh, we're using _PRE() and _POST() events...  this almost certainly
indicates a problem, there are very few circumstances where these are a
good idea and I'm not seeing anything in this driver which indicates
that this is going on.  Please just use normal DAPM widgets (I'm
guessing a PGA) to represent the device and work within DAPM, don't
shoehorn some bodge around the side.
