earlyprintk needs to be on the kernel command line to enable it.
Without this option it will work fine.

The only output is from the zImage decompressor.

It's a synchronous data fault and DFAR is 0xf8009fe0.

It's also a problem when running as a guest under a hypervisor as there
won't be any stage 2 translation table entries for non-existent peripherals.

I think there needs to be someway of finding out from the DTB which UART
to use.
