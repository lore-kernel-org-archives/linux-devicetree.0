I expect the best way to do this would be to write some documentation on the
clock-critical DT binding and/or CRITICAL_CLK flag. The only documentation I can
find currently is with the initial patch series [1] and the comment in
clk-provider.h of

 #define CLK_IS_CRITICAL         BIT(11) /* do not gate, ever */

Or the patch decription

"Critical clocks are those which must not be gated, else undefined
or catastrophic failure would occur.  Here we have chosen to
ensure the prepare/enable counts are correctly incremented, so as
not to confuse users with enabled clocks with no visible users."

Which is the functionality I want for this clock.

I'm always wary of creating a driver specific flag, especially when its
purpose is to do the same thing as an existing mechanism provided by the
subsystem of not gating the clock.

I can see a couple of problems with what you propose:

1) You have to put the clk-keep-on flag in every driver which consumes the
clock. IMO it is much better to have this knowledge in the SoC's
clock driver so every consumer of the clock automatically benefits.

2) You don't benefit from the CLK_IS_CRITICAL reference counting logic in
clk.c. So then each driver has to also work around that to get sensible reference
counts. e.g.

if (!__clk_is_enabled(clk) && pdata->clk-keep-on)
   clk_enable(clk)

Which seems to me to be fighting against the subsystem. Given that the only use of
 _clk_is_enabled() outside drivers/clk is in an old arch/arm/mach-omap2/pm24xx.c
driver I suspect its use is frowned upon, and it shouldn't really be an EXPORTED_SYMBOL.

regards,

Peter.
