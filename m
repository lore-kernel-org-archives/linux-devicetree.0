aliases is a bad choice, it's very very special and is neither a device
nor a virtual device, like chosen.

cpus is more of a match in your case.

In any case, I agree, you may not really need a compatible prop for the
virtual device. In fact, Grant, do we really need an enclosing node like
that ? In any case, it's no big deal and shouldn't have much impact on
the design.

Cheers,
Ben.
