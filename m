Jernej, thanks for the regulator change in another mail, yes
bananapi-m64 has HVCC regulator for HDMI glue, with this I'm able to
see penguins on screen.

Allwinner_A64_User_Manual_V1.1.pdf clearly shows PLL_VIDEO1 is
connected TCON1 which intern used by HDMI. I've verified both
PLL_VIDEO0 and 1 both seems working. I'm thinking we can go for
PLL_VIDEO1 as per datasheet, any suggestions?
