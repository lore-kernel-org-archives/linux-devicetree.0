Okay great. Btw do you need a notify being scheduled in those cases? I guess
your controller would get an interrupt and you will handle that in bottom
half and then cll this, so why not call in the bottom half?

ah which cases would those be. I was expecting that you would have a
platform_device as a slimbus controller which would call slim_register?
