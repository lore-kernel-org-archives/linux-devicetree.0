Once you start using DT in the secure OS, it doesn't seem too big a leap
for folks to want to start passing arguments, so I'd consider
secure-bootargs to be almost inevitable at *some* point down this road.

Perhaps we should consider a /secure-chosen node containing standard
properties instead...

...which different elements of firmware would in theory have a lot more
freedom to mangle between boot stages without the risk of disrupting the
regular /chosen properties.
