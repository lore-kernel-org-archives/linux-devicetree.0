Setting aside the idea of hard-coding filenames into any bootloader
binary, did you catch that the proposed solution would allow you to
continue using the dts filenames as they currently are?

The find command in my example /sbin/installdtbs script spits out the
in-tree dtb filename as it currently stands, and then you do what you
want with it in your script.  Including, copying it, filename intact,
into the location of your choice.  How could that possibly require you
to upgrade your bootloader?

I must admit I'm a bit mystified as to what Tegra is doing that this
breaks it so horribly...

thx,

Jason.
