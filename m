Yes, that's one of the solutions I envisaged, and likely to be the one
that I will put forward since it requires almost no changes. If we go that way
cache-level becomes pretty useless though (which might be a good thing) and I
do not like the implicit cache level obtained by counting phandles.
Another option would be making cache-level a list and add a property
"cache-level-affinity" as 1:1 map list of phandles to cpu-map node to define for
each CPU the level at which that cache is mapped, somthing like the bindings
described here for IRQ affinity:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2013-April/162466.html

I would say I tend to prefer the latter option, since I do not like relying
on unwritten rules (implicit level numbering implied by phandle traversal) but
I am open to suggestions.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
