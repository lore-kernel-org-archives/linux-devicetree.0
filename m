Neither. It's similar to how interrupt bindings work. For a clock
consumer, you have a phandle to the parent and some number of cells to
describe the connection. Often this is just the index or local interrupt
number. Obviously, interrupt numbers make more sense than clock numbers,
so having names is more useful in the clocks case if you have many outputs.

The name strings are just additional information. Keep in mind that the
clock node name can also be used if you need to attach a name to a clock.
