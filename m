The problem is the way the arm_dma_limit is set up, all dma allocations 
are currently broken regardless of if the actual device supports 64-bit 
addresses or not.

I previously asked about the arm_dma_limit and was told that the current 
behavior is the correct approach (see 
https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/devicetree-discuss/2013-April/032729.html 
and 
https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/devicetree-discuss/2013-April/032690.html) 


The point here is to set the mask to something reasonable such that 
allocations can succeed by default. If devices can't use part of the 
memory space they can adjust the limit accordingly.

Thanks,
Laura
