That is a good point!
Okay that makes more sense keep compatible string constant.
Class ID would be constant for given functionality that the driver will 
provide.

So we will end up with some thing like this:

soundwire@c2d0000 {
	compatible = "qcom,soundwire-v1.5.0"
	reg = <0x0c2d0000 0x2000>;	
         #address-cells = <1>;
         #size-cells = <0>;

	spkr_left:skpr@1{
		compatible = "sdw10217201000";
		reg = <0x1>
		sdw-link-id = <0>;
		...
	};

	spkr_right:spkr@2{
		compatible = "sdw10217201000";
		reg = <0x2>
		sdw-link-id = <0>;
	};
};

I will spin this in next version!
