I could write something up, although I guess someone will add a
select PINCTRL_MSM8X74 in the mach-msm Kconfig and then we're done
with it.

Oops.

We have to have a pingroup list, so I did look at having that list
referencing a common object with the gpio/sdc specific data.

But just having it in one large blob is the way that other pinctrl
drivers does it and hence a common problem to pinctrl and multi-platform
arm support.

I have not seen any code in the open referencing the other pins, so I
left them out for now.

Of course.

As this pinctrl/gpiochip/interrupt-controller is a fairly central part
of the system there's plenty of things that would just end up being deferred.

Most other pinctrl driver does arch_initcall or core_initcall, so I followed
suit and brought it in early.
