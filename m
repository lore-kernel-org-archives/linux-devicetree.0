this is a known issue, and I hope it will be fixed in upstream in v4.6,
the required changes in irqchip and gpiochip drivers were sent for
review some time ago, a bit more work is needed to 

Also 2-3 more clean-up changes in USB host and gadget drivers are done
locally (no more need to configure clocks out of the common clock
framework), but not yet submitted, will do it tomorrow.

Thank you for testing, I'm going to add your Tested-by tag (if you
don't mind) and submit a PR to ARM maintainers shortly.
