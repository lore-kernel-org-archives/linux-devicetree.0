By default yes, but we've been steering people to dual license them GPL/BSD.

I believe so yes. However, you already have the "source" for the most
part. Just run "dtc -I dtb -O dts <dtb file>". You loose the
preprocessing and include structure though (not necessarily a bad
thing IMO).

Then the question is what is the license on that generated dts!

I imagine the includes cause some licensing discrepancies if you dug into it.
