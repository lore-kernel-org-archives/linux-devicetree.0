Hi Mark,

I could use some more context for how this will be used. Do device
drivers need to be aware of which CPU can handle an interrupt for a
device, or is it the sort of thing that can be done in the background
when an irq is requested? What are some examples of device drivers using
this interface.

Part of the reason why I ask is I see a new function for parsing the
affinity, but no code that links it into the existing irq
infrastructure. Would this need to be called automatically when a DT
interrupt is parsed? Or when the irq is requested? Some guidance would
help me here.

Thanks,
g.
