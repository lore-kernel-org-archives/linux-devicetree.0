Ah, very interesting. Thanks for pointing that out.

I very much like that kind of approach. Stacking domains seems to solve
a number of issues at once:

- NVIDIA's gic extension
- TI's crossbar
- ARM's GICv2m
- Mediatek's glorified line inverter
- ... and probably the next madness that's going to land tomorrow

I haven't completly groked the way we're going to allocate domains and
irq_data structures, but this is definitely something worth
investigating. I'm not too worried about the indirection either - at
least we end up with maintainable code.

We need to work out how to drive the whole stacking from a DT
perspective: Mark, any idea?

Jiang, would you mind keeping us ARM folks posted when you resend your
patch series? That'd be much appreciated.

In the meantime, I'll furbish an axe and aim it squarely at the GIC
code... ;-)

Thanks again,

	M.
