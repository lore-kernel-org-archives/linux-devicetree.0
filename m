This is not even remotely an unreasonable list.  Also remember that
newer revisions can (and should!) claim compatibility with an older
version if it is indeed compatible.

Typically what happens is one particular implementation ends up
becoming the defacto standard implementation.  So instead of each
implementation claiming compatibility with a loosely defined "arm,pmu"
(a definition that can end up changing over time), each of the above
implementation may end up claiming "arm,cortex-a8-pmu" compatibility.
In essence the string "arm,cortex-a8-pmu" *becomes* the generic
version without the ambiguity of what to do if/when arm invents an
incompatible PMU.

That's tangential to the argument.  There is very good reason to
anchor compatible values to specific implementations.  Doing it this
way costs nothing.  Not doing it causes ambiguity down the road that
is hard to recover from.
