Correct. Now the question is how to get those values in the array.
There are two ways:

a) the boot CPU generates them
b) the boot CPU parses them from DT

case a) For this to work, and to be able to boot on every CPU on every
        cluster we need to have a way to detect the number of clusters
	and the number of CPUs per cluster
case b) Just parse the tree and retrieve the "reg" property, patch 1 of
        this series

Now, as you know ways better than I do, to boot an SMP system (with a
GIC) we need a pair {mpidr, GIC CPU IF id} and the values must be linked
(ie they have to uniquely represent a CPU), you correctly stated that in
your reply.

Hence, as you said, we need to retrieve the GIC CPU IF related to a given
MPIDR. We cannot generate it, as the current code assumes.

Example (dual-cluster system, each cluster made up of two CPUS, no SMT)

* CLUSTER 0

HWCPU0: MPIDR=0x0 
HWCPU1: MPIDR=0x1 

* CLUSTER 1

HWCPU2: MPIDR=0x100 
HWCPU3: MPIDR=0x101

Even if we knew the number of cpus per cluster and the number of clusters 
at boot

MPIDR = 0x101 does NOT imply GIC CPU IF id=0x3

The following formula does not work all the time
(GIC CPU IF id = MPIDR[7:0] + nb_cpus_in_lower_cluster_indexes)

NB: nb_cpus_in_lower_cluster_indexes must be computed by the boot CPU.

ARM mandate that numbering, but it is not a strict requirement (GICs
deviating from that numbering will be the exception, not the rule, but
we have to cater for them).

Hence we need a way to link GIC CPU IF id to MPIDR and that's patch 4 or
we could do that by using static data, I see no other solution.

But if we accept we can use DT to create that link, we can also use DT
to init cpu_logical_map instead of generating its values (since the linkage in
DT is done by using "cpu" nodes).

I have no strong opinion on this, just would like us to agree on a clean and
proper way forward, so any comment more than welcome.

That's the first thing I thought when I noticed the MPIDR config for 
multi-clusters.

That's agreed.

I agree Russell, nothing to object, but you should concede that having
op-codes with bits switched is easier to detect :) (even though if we
decide to "generate" the cpu_logical_map with a bunch of code, the pen 
release code will easily go pop if MPIDR is botched).

PATCH 5 can also be used to count the number of CPUs per cluster and the 
number of clusters in the system if we cannot rely on a HW mechanisms to probe 
that.

I will keep it on my tree in case we deem it necessary.

Thank you very much,
Lorenzo
