Things always start out so simple...

Removing irq.h from irqdomain.h fixes my original problem. However, that
breaks on x86 since x86 has it's own struct irq_domain. Some ifdef'ing
could fix it since x86 doesn't use irq_chip_generic. Didn't you have
converting x86 in your original irq domain patches?
