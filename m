Thanks for your reply.

the driver only take care of one timer node, if we have 3 timer node defined.
It means that the driver will be probed 3 times.

Each timer is a controller, and one timer has 3 counters. each counter can be
set to be free running or period mode.

marvell,timer-id may not be needed, but the marvell,counter-id need to
be passed.
The timer driver depends on the id to distinguish the register or bit
in the register.

It is the final choice, but it depends on the clock DT support.
I just begin the clock DT support for mach-mmp. They are still in design phase.
Clock framework is more complicated than the timer controller.

So how can I make Linux to allocate them as required?

I am a little confused.

So what is your suggestions?
we have the below usage
1. UP SOC, we need clock source, clock event device
2. SMP SOC with arch timer, we need clock source, broadcast clock event device
3. SMP SOC without arch timer, we need clock source, NR_CPU clock
event device and delay timer.

I see. I think a simple description is enough. i do not need mention the shared
interrupts here because the timer driver does not care about it.

All the timers can be seen by every CPUes.
For arch timer, each CPU see its own instance, while for the mmp
timers, each CPU
can see all of them.
So there are some problems
1. The number of the timer is not fixed. It can be 2, 3, 4
2. Some timers can be seen by CP, and CP will use these timers. Which
timer can be seen
    by CP is defined by SOC design
3. Some counter share one interrupt, these counters can not be
allocated for per cpu timer to replace
    arch timer.
So which counter allocated is limited by SOC design.

So if do not have above limitation, can you tell me that how can i let
kernel to decide allocation?
Thanks.

It is true that arch timer is first priority.
There are something need to be considered
1. we registered NR_CPU timers to acts as arch timer. We set the
cpu_mask of be cpu_mask(cpu_id), not
    cpu_mask(ALL_CPUes). We also bind the interrupt to the dedicated
CPU. For example, if timer 0 counter 0
    is used by CPU0 to replace arch timer. the counter's IRQ only
route to the CPU0.
    If we have arch timers, it means that there are NR_CPU timers, i
do not think they can be acts as broadcast timer
2. As i said, some coutners share interrupts. We can not allocated
this kind of counter as per cpu clock event device.
    For exmaple, timer 0 coutner1 and counter 2 share same interrupt.
If they are used by CPU0 and CPU1, it means that
    same interrupt will be bind to two CPUes. each timer interrupt
happens, a power-down core need wake up to check the
    interrupt does not targets at it.

So how to use these counter in fact depends on the SOCes design.
That why i need pass this kind of information to timer driver.

The reason is couple idle.
The couple idle implementation implies that CPU0 will be first core wake up.
So, we can not have CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_DYNIRQ because it may make CPU1 to
be first core wake up.
