This is the promised rework of the at91 PMC clocks driver. It is mainly
necessary to remove the DTC warnings but it also complies with the CCF
rule that there should be one node per controller instead of one node
per clock.

This only handles the PMC, I'm planning to also rework the SCKC bindings
later (without breaking the DT ABI).

The series is based on top of v4.19-rc1.

The first two patches are actually fixes and may be considered for this
cycle.

I'll take the device tree changes through the at91 tree as DT backward
compatibility is working.

Changes in v2:
 - Add at91sam926x and at91sam9rl drivers
 - use CLK_OF_DECLARE_DRIVER
 - Add helpers to allocate for the proper number of clocks
 - Collected Rob's acks
