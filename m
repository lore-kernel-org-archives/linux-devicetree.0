Ok. So the IRQF_SHARED_TIMER_OK flag would make sense here.

If they're not shared with an IRQF_NO_SUSPEND IRQ, then everything is
already OK. If they are shared with an IRQF_NO_SUSPEND IRQ, then the
fundamental problem is not solved by any approach so far.

As Rafael and I described, sharing an IRQ between a wakeup device (the
serial, rtc, and wdt) and an IRQF_NO_SUSPEND device is broken. You have
the choice between losing wakeup events or masking timer events.

So those device above which operate as wakeup devices cannot share a
line with a timer.

I'm trying to focus on the cases we can actually salvage. 

An IRQ cannot be shared between a device with IRQF_NO_SUSPEND and a
device that wishes to operate as a wakeup device, because the semantics
don't align. One wishes to handle IRQs continuously and one wants to
abort suspend at the first IRQ (waiting until part-way through the
resume before handling it).

So those devices above which wish to operate as wakeup devices are
either irrelevant or unsalvageable with the current approaches.

The flag or demux chip only happens to mask the problem in the absence
of strict sanity checking.

If you want to be able to share the line then you will need to
fundamentally rework the way wakeup interrupts work in order to be able
to decide when you've encountered a real wakeup event.

Thanks,
Mark.
