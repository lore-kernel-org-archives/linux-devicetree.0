We normally don't assume that a particular unit address implies
a specific function. Conventionally that would be done by matching
the "compatible" property instead.

What you do clearly works, but it's surprising to the reader.

There are probably several ways of doing this better, we should see
what the best is we can come up with.

I think generally speaking we need a way for a mailbox user to
know what it should use as the mailbox data here, so it is
able to talk to different incompatible mailbox providers.

One idea I had is to use a nested mailbox driver, that turns
a doorbell or single-register styled mailbox into a variable-length
mailbox by adding a memory region, like

    mailbox@1233000 {
        compatible = "vendor-hardware-specifc-id";
        interrupts = <34>;
        reg = <0x1233000 0x100>;
        #mbox-cells = <1>;
    };

    mailbox {
           compatible = "shmem-mailbox";
           mboxes = <&/mailbox@1233000  25>;
           #mbox-cells = <1>;
           shmem = <&cpu_scp_lpri &cpu_scp_hpri>;
    };

This would create one mailbox that only takes a register argument,
and another one that can take longer messages based on the first.
In your driver, you then refer to the second one and pass the
variable-length data into that directly.
