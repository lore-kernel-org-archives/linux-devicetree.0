It's optional syntactically, yes.

But,

a) Nodes must be named after their type, not their identity, so then you
end up with multiple nodes named "clock", all/many of which are children
of the same parent.

b) Nodes must have unique names within their parent, so you can
unambiguously specify which node you're accessing.

If (b) is not satisfied by node name alone, adding the unit address to
the node name is the way you make it unique.

The DT structure should be driven purely by the HW structure. The driver
structure should have no influence over the DT structure. If there's a
single HW module that exposes N clocks, there should be a single DT node
that's a clock provider, which uses #clock-cells>0 to identify the
clocks that consumers use.
