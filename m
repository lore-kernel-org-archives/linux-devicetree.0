Liviu's patch is nothing more than a hack.  It changes (eg) the active
low level to be an active high level with the explicitly stated reason to
bypass a test, and then hopes that the remaining functions do the right
thing.

It would be better to explicitly bypass the test, and then explicitly
handle other cases in gic_configure_irq().

It would be even better to make the code reflect reality right the way
through.  If PPIs are non-configurable, then we should return -EINVAL if
trying to set them to a setting which is not supported.  For example,
pass through all states to gic_configure_irq(), and have gic_configure_irq()
return whether the state is valid.

Then, gic_configure_irq() can read back the register after trying to set
the appropriate value, and see whether it was taken.  If the bits remain
unchanged, then it can decide that the requested mode is not supported,
and return -EINVAL.

In any case, let's not hack the code in the way that Liviu is trying to
do.
