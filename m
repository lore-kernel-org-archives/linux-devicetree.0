I wasn't implying that this should get exposed to userspace as
components. V4L2 has gone that route with media controller and
sub-devs. Perhaps that is needed for DRM, perhaps not. For the moment,
I definitely agree the kernel should hide most/all of those details,
but I don't think that means DT has to hide the details or know what
components are handled by a single driver. My point was that on the DT
side we have a mixture of OF graph usage, parent-child nodes or custom
phandles (this case) to describe the relationships between h/w
components. That's not necessarily wrong, but we should have some
rules around how certain relationships are described. Then in the
drivers we have a mixture of deferred probe, component API, and custom
inter-module APIs to control init order. We then have a mixture of all
those which leads to very few if any drivers having the same overall
structure that could be shared. Should we mandate using the component
API for h/w that is discrete blocks? Should we throw out the component
API for something else? Can we tie the graph parsing and component API
together with common code?

OF graph is supposed to do this. OF graph is a double edged sword. It
is very flexible, but then each platform can do something different.
We need to have some level of requirements around how the OF graph is
used. As an example, any system with an HDMI connector should have an
"hdmi-connector" compatible node or encoder/bridge chips/blocks must
have certain ports defined.

We really want to err on the side of fewer bindings, not more as once
used they are an ABI.
