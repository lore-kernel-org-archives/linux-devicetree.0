Sorry, I can not get your point here. Let me describe the problem I met:
 - regulator_is_supported_voltage is not exported. when I build clk-reg-cpufreq
   as kernel module, there's a link error.
 - I saw linux/regulator/consumer.h has some dummy functions if !REGULATOR. I
   tried to make clk-reg-cpufreq driver work even !REGULATOR. I think that's
   why the dummy functions are there. If regulator_get return NULL, it'll avoid
   calling other regulator functions. But regulator_is_supported_voltage and
   regulator_set_voltage_time don't have such dummy ones. Undefined functions.

Thanks
