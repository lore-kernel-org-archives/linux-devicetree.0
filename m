Sorry for the noise,

I just noticed that I didn't send the cover letter itself to the
list. Anyway, I decided to review the whole clock mess again and
came up with a quite nice set of patches which split clocks between
DT- and code-registered clocks.

Actually, I need Alexandre to (re-)add BG2Q support first, but if he
is busy, I'll send the preliminary version on Sunday or Monday.

@Mike: I know it is late in the cycle, but I'd love to see this in
for the next release already. There are functional bugs for sure,
but actually Berlin SoC support is so minimal, there is nothing we
can really break. I'll put that in the real patch set's cover letter
again, but when I send it, I will have prepared a topic branch of it
and put it into linux-next to make sure, it doesn't break others.

If you NAK taking it for the next release, we would have to squeeze
in some DT tweaks with fixed-clocks as placeholders for the missing
clocks. Antonine and Alexandre are doing a great job adding
functionality to Berlin SoCs but, of course, lack clocks here and
there. Using DT fixed-clocks would be ok now, but proper clock nodes
even if the corresponding drivers are buggy would be best.

I have compared driver generated frequencies with Marvell's BSP
u-boot clock report and they match, so it isn't too buggy :P

@Alexandre, Antoine:
The latest set of patches is at
https://github.com/shesselba/linux-berlin.git topic/clk

Please have a look at it and prepare BG2Q patches that I can
add/squeeze to it. Also, if you have comments already, do not
hesitate to send them directly to me.

Sebastian
