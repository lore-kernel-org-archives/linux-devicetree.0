FYI my patches are related to a small contracting work spanning 20 days
amounting to 15 real days (from scratch).  ATM my SoW not only doesn't
include this 'new feature' but excludes it. So I cannot promise I'll
look into it, though it shouldn't be too big a thing.
It seemed clear that you wanted to squeeze it with the rest, but after
setting things up for the EVM and observing mainline was broken with
4bits ECC on an 8bits NAND I thought it was impossible nobody hadn't
noticed it .. so I dug in the mail archive, only to find there had
already been some alerts raised some months ago on the list, so I picked
up my next item.

Ok, thanks.
