Kishon,

thanks for the clarification. While the extra marvell,phy-base-address
property basically works and I agree with it, I may have some
_potential_ draw-backs:

The Marvell BSP code (which I have no clue _why_ it does what it does
or if it is required) has some magic writes to "improve" serial signal
quality. I left them out as my HDD was detected with and without them.

Now, if we find that they are required, we have to find a way to make
the PHY driver know about the PHY revision. We'd usually add a
different compatible and deal with it accordingly.

So, not adding the compatible now _may_ just postpone a follow-up patch
for the different PHY setup of BG2 and render the new phy_base property
basically useless.

If you are just unhappy with the "static u32 bg2q_sata_phy_base"
assigned to of_device_id.data, I can convert that to Felipe's proposal.

Sebastian
