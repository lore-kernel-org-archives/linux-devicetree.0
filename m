This patchset enables the bcm2835-i2s driver to use the clock
framework which was introduced with commit 94cb7f76caa0b337
("Switch to using the new clock driver support").

This commit resulted in the fact that the bcm2835-i2s driver was
no longer working due to some register addresses used by 2 drivers
(clk-bcm2835 and bcm2835-i2s).

To make it all possible this also required the introduction
of the PCM clock into the clk-bcm2835 driver. This patchset
relies on the patch by Remi Pommarel <repk@triplefau.lt>
that introduces the ability to set parent clocks
("clk: bcm2835: Support for clock parent selection"), which is
(as far as I understood) in clk-next and slated for 4.5.

Note that there is one regression: the clk-bcm2835 does not yet
support the mash functionality which the SOC-Hw supports, this
may result in slightly more "audiable noise" than the original
driver. But as this is more about making the driver functional
again, this is - I believe - a drawback we can accept for now.

  clk: bcm2835: enable management of PCM clock
  ASoC: bcm2835: move to use the clock framework
  ARM: bcm2835: I2S: use new register-range and clock framework

    framework
