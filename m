Correct. Formatting should not be done at the location of recording
(it's way too much overhead). Even trace_printk() doesn't format string
at the execution path, but does so at the presentation path (reading
the buffer, via reads of the trace file, or in trace-cmd post
processing of the trace.dat file).

trace_printk() uses vbin_printf() which doesn't do printf()
conversions, but instead only saves the format string and the raw
values into the buffer. Then in uses bstr_printf() that takes the
format string and raw values to produce the "printf()" output you know
and love.
