The times I've looked at it recently it's been stuck in DT style issues
rather than anything substantially ASoC related, as far as I can tell
the binding is essentially empty from an ASoC point of view and
inherited from the of_graph binding.  There's bits in that are a bit
random like specifically listing the CPU DAIs and only them but that
just looks like one of these random DT things that's predetermined.  I
really can't see anything at all in there to review from an ASoC point
of view, I've applied the changes that don't seem blocked on the
binding.  If there's something you're looking for then please say...

We never seem to make any progress on the generic changes in drivers/of at
the start of the series either...

But the ports can still have indexes AFAICT (the examples show port@0,
port@1 and so on) so we still need to define what those indexes mean
which is what this is doing?
