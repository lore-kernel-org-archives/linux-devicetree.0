Link?

This is fpga manager based driver where "cat" won't be used.

up2you what you want to do with it. If you work with different boards
with different FPGAs it is at least helpful to know if X.bit target this
or that board. Unfortunately I am not aware about any public document
which describe what there is written.

It is about comfort but I have really not a problem that driver will
handle just BIN format.

In vivado it is one tcl cmd. But truth is that I don't really get why
BIN is not generated by default.

agree.
