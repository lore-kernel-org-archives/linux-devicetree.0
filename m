Ok for earlycon.

For the console, I thought likewise .. until I _struggled_ to understand
why the console was disappearing under my feet.
It seemed even stranger when I started looking at the codepath because
drivers/of/base.c would properly add_preferred_console as expected after
the corresponding UART was added. But the reality was there, without it
the console was not like stdout-path.
Among the commits that could instill doubt as to whether stdout-path
rules is f64255b5072d:
"The assumption that at least 1 preferred console will be registered
when the stdout-path property is set is invalid, which can result in
_no_ consoles.", though it didn't answer my question.
I started looking whether tty0 was not getting in the way and in the end
I came up with setting console.
But you seem affirmative.
