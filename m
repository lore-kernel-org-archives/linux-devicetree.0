It is a bad comment.  I will update.  This is the minimum period (in 
bytes) at which the interrupt can tick.  Other possible value for the
period must be multiple of this value.

Let me review this handler and I will enhance as needed.

I can integrate it with the calling code.

Yes, I believe I can set this via "set_tdm_slot".

Okay, will remove.  It is not needed if I set the port mode from the 
machine file (current done via device tree).
