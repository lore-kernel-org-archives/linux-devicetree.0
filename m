To me LPASS is somehow similar to the camera subsystem, it's a container/
manager for all the audio related sub-IP blocks.  The LPASS (top) SFR 
region contains bits for resetting sub-blocks like: DMAC, SRAM, TIMER, WDT,
I2S, UART.  It also contains mask and status bits of interrupts from those
IP blocks to the CPU or the embedded MCU (CA5). An (incomplete) list of 
registers can be seen at [1]. There are also entries for software triggered
interrupts to the CPU/MCU, for the MCU reset vector control and general 
purpose register for CPU/MCU communication.

In the SoC there is a dedicated power domain for the whole audio subsystem 
and LPASS also contains a VIC itself. We could try to decompose the LPASS 
top block into various subsystems but I seriously doubt it's a good way
forward. I think LPASS should rather be some top level SoC platform entity.
