We're probably OK just going down to the master clocks mostly I think.
For the clocks on the actual bus we can probably have helpers in the
core that generate the clocks and the drivers just tell the core the
rates.

I've not been able to dig far enough into the clock bindings yet.
That's not super helpful for you I appreciate, TBH nobody seemed to
particularly need this so it wasn't super urgent - most of the things
using alternative clocks on devices seem to also need custom machine
drivers for other reasons.
