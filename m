Other examples are power controllers or some MFD device (as we have on
vexpress). For these we normally have phandles.

But isn't fuse some piece of hardware? We don't have a model for it, so
I guess you just present it as a library that accesses the hardware.
Anyway, in such case something like Pawel's SoC driver proposal would
work. Now if anything inside the SoC bus (I have to re-read, I don't
fully remember the details) is probed after the SoC driver, you could
even initialise your SoC at device_initcall() level.

I fully agree. But we shouldn't really extend the "old DT" statement to
a new ARMv8 SoC ;).
