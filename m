Sounds like either that (undisclosed) driver has a problem or you're
using it inappropriately.

For the reasons I mentioned above having a set_sysclk() function is not
mandatory and your driver will not be merged with a stub such as is
currently present.  As far as I can tell you are trying to bodge around
some problem elsewhere in either the code or your usage of it.

I don't think anyone is going to care about an extra read on system
init, and in any case if the driver followed best practice and provided
register defaults that read would be satisfied from cache.
