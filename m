You can add to asm-generic/sections.h:

#ifndef ARCH_DTB_PADDING
#define ARCH_DTB_PADDING
#endif

and change KERNEL_DTB() to:

#define KERNEL_DTB()                                                    \
       STRUCT_ALIGN();                                                 \
       VMLINUX_SYMBOL(__dtb_start) = .;                                \
       *(.dtb.init.rodata)                                             \
       ARCH_DTB_PADDING                                \
       VMLINUX_SYMBOL(__dtb_end) = .;

Then microblaze can predefine ARCH_DTB_PADDING in its
<asm/sections.h>.

Still, it will crash badly if the external DTB is larger than
ARCH_DTB_PADDING.
