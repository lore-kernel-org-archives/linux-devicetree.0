Looks good, thanks for your work on this.

One small nitpick:

+static struct sunxi_sram_desc sun4i_a10_sram_a3_a4 = {
+	.data	= SUNXI_SRAM_DATA("A3-A4", 0x4, 0x4, 1,
+				  SUNXI_SRAM_MAP(0, "cpu"),
+				  SUNXI_SRAM_MAP(1, "emac")),
+};

According to the A10 datasheet bits 4 and 5 control the
A3-A4 mapping, with values 2 and 3 being reserved, so the
first line here should be:

+	.data	= SUNXI_SRAM_DATA("A3-A4", 0x4, 0x4, 2,

Other then that this looks good and is:
