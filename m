Whew, glad to know I'm not crazy.

I asked him for it earlier [1], apparently it's a very invasive patch
series which breaks things.  I would like to look at it as a reference,
even if applying it isn't a good idea.

How about it, Andrew?

Agreed.

In [1] I was trying to setup a stand-in, eg kirkwood_get_clock() and
kirkwood_put_clock() that could be replaced once the clock code lands.
That way, we're on the right path, but not blocked waiting for the clock
code.

thx,

Jason.
