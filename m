I agree. I see two possible syntaxes:

1) keep the same definitions in the containers:

sound {
	compatible =3D "simple-audio-card";
	simple-audio-card,name =3D "Cubox Audio";

	simple-audio-card,dai-link@0 {		/* I2S - HDMI */
		simple-audio-card,cpu {
			sound-dai =3D <&audio1 0>;
			format =3D "i2s";
		};
		simple-audio-card,codec {
			sound-dai =3D <&tda998x 0>;
		};
	};

	simple-audio-card,dai-link@1 {		/* S/PDIF - HDMI */
		simple-audio-card,cpu {
			sound-dai =3D <&audio1 1>;
		};
		simple-audio-card,codec {
			sound-dai =3D <&tda998x 1>;
		}
	};
	...

2) new definitions in the container

sound {
	compatible =3D "simple-audio-card";
	simple-audio-card,name =3D "Cubox Audio";

	simple-audio-card,dai-link@0 {		/* I2S - HDMI */
		format =3D "i2s";
		cpu-dai  =3D <&audio1 0>;
		codec-dai =3D <&tda998x 0>;
	};

	simple-audio-card,dai-link@1 {		/* S/PDIF - HDMI */
		cpu-dai =3D <&audio1 1>;
		codec-dai =3D <&tda998x 1>;
	};
	...

The 2nd syntax is simpler and clearer, but the properties of the CPU
DAI and of the CODEC DAI are the same in the container (format, clock
and PCM slots). Is this a problem?

BTW, there is a 'dai_fmt' in the DAI link, but this format is not used
in the simple-card. Why?
