Mapping the same memory range is a function of the driver, NOT the
device tree. The DT should match the reality of the hardware, not try
and copy the internal driver structure. I am not sure if 6 independent
GPIO ports makes sense vs. 1 single all-encompassing GPIO node.. I
don't think it affects defining GPIO or mux configuration adversely
either way.

The docs for the memory map are there's one GPIO controller, with a
bank of registers from 0x10015000 to 0x10015FFF (4KiB). Internally it
may be 6 instantiations of the same IP block inside some fabric
wrapper, but the docs don't make any assertions to this effect except
by definition of the registers (in fact, the registers are documented
once, and the locations of each port register are documented within
the block).

I would suggest just one GPIO block, which contains all the pinctrl
definitions (refering to port, pin, mux, etc. and not just pin, mux)
and the GPIO binding gets modified to specify not only the pin number
but the port as well, in the same way, so that the driver can
calculate which register offset inside the controller it uses.

That's a bit of a driver rewrite to achieve, but it'd be worth it to
preserve the design details of the hardware and letting the drivers do
the work they should be doing instead of shunting the details into the
DT unecessarily.
