Before we update the bindings, document the current graph bindings
and usage of additional properties.

+Graph bindings for Coresight
+-------------------------------
+
+Coresight components are interconnected to create a data path for the flow of
+trace data generated from the "sources" to their collection points "sink".
+Each coresight component must describe the "input" and "output" connections.
+The connections must be described via generic DT graph bindings as described
+by the "bindings/graph.txt", where each "port" along with an "endpoint"
+component represents a hardware port and the connection.
+
+Since it is possible to have multiple connections for any coresight component
+with a specific direction of data flow, each connection must define the
+following properties to uniquely identify the connection details.
+
+ * Direction of the data flow w.r.t the component :
+   Each input port must have the following property defined at the "endpoint"
+   for the port.
+	"slave-mode"
+
+ * Hardware Port number at the component:
+     -  The hardware port number is assumed to be the address of the "port"
+         component.
