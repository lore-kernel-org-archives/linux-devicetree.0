I picked up the v2 version of this RFC and rebased it to the latest
bluetooth-next and added ACPI support. It also kinda works, but there's
a few problems left to track down and I still haven't looked into
getting rid of the config blobs.

It sounded like Martin wasn't going to be able to get to this until
at least the 4.18 cycle, so unless he objects I'm going to look at
getting what I've got working with that bt3wire.c driver.

Regards,
Jeremy
