I plan to submit this for 4.3.

That is in essence an overclocked setting, the max CPU voltage officially is
1.4V, I do not think that we should provide any overclocked settings in the
official dts files. If people really want to overclock they will have to
modify there dts themselves IMHO.

Technically this is possible, but I do not think that it is a good idea.
