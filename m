This series add support for mapping and routing GIC interrupts as well
as setting up the GIC timer through device-tree.  Patches 1 adds the
"mti" vendor prefix, patch 2 adds the GIC binding document, and patches
3 and 4 add device-tree support for the GIC irqchip and clocksource drivers,
respectively.

Based on next-20141028, which includes part 1 [0] and part 2 [1] of my
GIC cleanup series.

Changes from v2:
 - added back third cell to specifier to differentiate between shared and
   local interrupts
 - added timer sub-node and it's properties
 - changed compatible string to include CPU version
 - rebased on GIC cleanup series

Changes from v1:
 - updated bindings to drop third interrupt cell and remove CPU interrupt
   controller as the parent of the GIC
 - moved GIC to drivers/irqchip/
 - other minor fixes/cleanups
