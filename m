Hi Mark,

First of all, thanks for your comments.

Yes, it's better. I will use bitmask instead.

I'm trying to avoid the case where multiple events may claim the same
available counter.
There's a race condition here.

You're right. This should never happen. I'll remove it.

Sure, I'll change it along with bitmap use.

Okay, I'll refer to arm-ccn.c to enforce CPU assignment to the first core.

Yes, this is over checking. I'll remove it.

Right. It's not necessary. Will get rid of it.

Yes, will remove this check.

These are X-Gene PMU specific for monitoring performance of a specific
data path.
X-Gene PMUs have 2 registers capable of masking the Agents from which
the request come from. If the bit with the bit number corresponding to
the AgentID
is set, the event will be counted only if it is caused by a request
from that agent.
Each PMU has different set of Agents. By default, the event will be counted for
all agent requests.

I'll have it commented better for next revision of the patch.

Okay.
