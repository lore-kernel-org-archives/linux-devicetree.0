Yes, this should have been be in that structure to begin with.

I'm working through doing a comprehensive replacement of
global variables like this with values passed around as
arguments.  I've intended to do it all along but your nudge
pushed it to the top of my list.  It's a *lot* of work, much
more than I realized.  But I'm making rapid progress.

OK.

There used to be a more elaborate scheme for supporting
lots of versions, and I have tried to preserve at least part
of the underlying mechanism (the parse and construct functions).
Not all of these registers use the indirect functions, and
it looks to me like none of them are in the data path.

The most important registers for the fast path are found in
the GSI code.  And that doesn't use this construct--it only
reads and writes 32-bit registers.  (I think it differs
because it was originally developed by a different team.)

> How many different versions do we have to support in practice
I don't know for sure how many versions really were used,
but the original code had about 10 distinct version values,
many of which shared most (but not all) register definitions
(offset and bit field widths) with older versions.

With the upstream code the decision was made to ignore anything
older than IPA version 3 (and 3.5.1 in particular, which is
found in the SDM845 SoC).  

It may be that this parse/construct mechanism isn't justified
at this point.  I thought the way it presented a generic
interface was useful, but with just one (initial) hardware
target we don't (yet) realize its potential benefit.  It could
be added back later, as support for new versions is added.

As of now I don't plan to change this, but if you or someone
else feels it would be better without it I can do that.
