These patches add support for the Scorpion PMU found on devices
such as msm8660, qsd8x50, etc. The first patch is some groundwork
to make functions more "generic". Even then we end up copying quite
a bit of code from the Krait part into the Scorpion part with only
subtle tweaks because two things happen:

 1. We gain another "region" register, L2LPM
 2. The way to access the region registers are with different cp15 instructions

I'm not sure how to make this better, suggestions are welcome.

Changes from v1:
 * Added stub functions for CONFIG_CPU_V7=n
 * Fixed L2LPM register accessors
 * Exposed mp and !mp versions of PMU to userspace differently (mrutland)
 * Dropped I-cache events that shouldn't be there (mrutland)
 * Fixed branch misprediction event (mrutland)
