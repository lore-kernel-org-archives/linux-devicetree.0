I suggest adding an alias to the serial node, so you can just use the
alias name instead of the path (also I never tried using an actual
path, but wouldn't it be "/soc/serial@78b0000"?).

I think it's nice to have the nodes ordered by their (first) registers
address, so maybe consider doing that. This makes it also clear where
new blocks should be added, and if several people try to add blocks
the chance of conflicts is reduced.

Assuming ipq4019 is the name of the emulated chip and not a special id
for the emulator, and "IPQ4019 R3PC" is the dts file for the emulator,
you could set the clock-frequency in the board dts instead of forcing
every "real chip" board dts to overwrite/clear it.
