Only PATCH3 needs to go through clk maintainers rest all patches
are DT bindings document and DTS changes which can go through
Broadcom tree. Right ??

Yes, we have already squashed DTS patches from same author into
one DTS patch except NAND, PINCTRL and GPIO patches.

The NAND, PINCTRL, and GPIO patches were not squashed into
one patch for easy review but since you suggest I will squash these
three DTS patches into one DTS patch.
