I personally wouldn't object, but it's not a PCI thing so that can all
be separate from this driver.

Sounds reasonable.  So v2 will be something other than SMP8759?
I renamed it to CONFIG_PCIE_TANGO_SMP8759.

If you confirm that
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/helgaas/pci.git/commit/?h=pci/host-tango&id=d752a8b29345
works for you, I'll include it in my v4.13 pull request.
