Will it cause misleading that it only supports one state?
And if we only define pinctrl-0 here, how do we describe pinctrl-names?
It should be "default"? It looks not accurate enough to me.

Per my understanding, I think it's better to leave it as standard
pinctrl-binding doc states since anyhow people should read pinctrl-binding doc.

Yes,in the original patch it's like:
+- pinctrl-<n>          : Pinctrl states as described in bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
+- pinctrl-names                : Names corresponding to the numbered pinctrl states

If remove one tab:
+- pinctrl-<n>          : Pinctrl states as described in bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
+- pinctrl-names        : Names corresponding to the numbered pinctrl states

But in vim reading the code, it's like:
- pinctrl-<n>           : Pinctrl states as described in bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
- pinctrl-names : Names corresponding to the numbered pinctrl states
I don't know why.
What should we do about this case?
