I think the opposite. Just drop 'items' and leave 'description'.

'items' can be a list or dictionary. When it's a dictionary, the
schema for 'items' is applied to each item. For example:

items:
  enum: [ rx, tx ]
  uniqueItems: true

'uniqueItems' prevents the case of 'rx, rx' or 'tx, tx'.

Even when we reference things by name, the order should be defined
still. Using names allows for skipping entries.

If you have a mixture, I'd prefer to see dts files cleaned-up.
