Hi Mark,

While we are discussing on how to handle the twl6040 MFD deive via DT
and to whether load the child drivers via DT or to load them via
mfd_add_devices() I came up with this dts entry for the later case
(mfd_add_devices mode):

&i2c1 {
	twl6040: twl@4b {
		compatible =3D "ti,twl6040";
		reg =3D <0x4b>;

		interrupts =3D <0 119 4>;
		interrupt-parent =3D <&gic>;
		twl6040,audpwron-gpio =3D <&gpio4 31 0>;

		vio-supply =3D <&v1v8>;
		v2v1-supply =3D <&v2v1>;
		enable-active-high;

		/* regulators for vibra motor */
		vddvibl-supply =3D <&vbat>;
		vddvibr-supply =3D <&vbat>;

		vibra {
			/* Vibra driver, motor resistance parameters */
			ti,vibldrv-res =3D <8>;
			ti,vibrdrv-res =3D <3>;
			ti,viblmotor-res =3D <10>;
			ti,vibrmotor-res =3D <10>;
		};
	};
};

With this mode:
No need to tell that twl6040 is acts as interrupt controller since the
interrupts it is handling is only for internal functions dispatched via
a single irq line toward the CPU.

The audio (ASoC codec) child is always enabled since it is the main
function of the twl6040.

The tricky part is the vibra: it needs two regulators (to provide power
to the motors). Since the regulators can only be connected to the device
described in dt, this is what I need to do:
to get the vibra parameters (in the twl6040-vibra driver):

struct device_node *node =3D of_find_node_by_name(
				pdev->dev.parent->of_node, "vibra");

...
of_property_read_u32(node, "ti,vibldrv-res", &info->vibldrv_res);
...

To get the regulators needed by the vibra driver when booted with DT:

info->supplies[0].supply =3D "vddvibl";
info->supplies[1].supply =3D "vddvibr";
if (!pdata)
	ret =3D regulator_bulk_get(pdev->dev.parent,
		ARRAY_SIZE(info->supplies), info->supplies);
else
	ret =3D regulator_bulk_get(info->dev,
		ARRAY_SIZE(info->supplies), info->supplies);


I need to use the pdev->dev.parent to be able to get the needed
regulators. Is this acceptable?
