I'm using VFIO platform driver for this purpose. VFIO platform driver is 
capable of assigning any platform device to a guest machine with this driver. 

You just unbind the HIDMA channel driver from the hypervisor and bind to vfio
driver using the very same approach you'd use with PCIe. 

Of course, this all assumes the presence of an IOMMU driver on the system. VFIO
driver uses the IOMMU driver to create the mappings. 

The mechanism used here is not different from VFIO PCI from user perspective.

No, these are the only patches. We have one patch for the QEMU but from kernel
perspective this is it. 

I just rely on the platform VFIO driver to do the work.
