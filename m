Hi,

This series primarily adds the dwc3 DT node which activates the usb3 controller on
the stih407-b2120 and stih410-b2120 platforms.

As part of getting this working I noticed some various errors with the DT
documentation examples for how we reference the PHYs which I've also fixed.

Whilst doing this I also noticed the miphy365 (found on stih415/6 platforms) could
now use the generic PHY constants which are used by miphy28, so I've updated this
driver and the DT docs accoringly. Note there is no ABI breakage with this change.

Also miphy28lp driver isn't included in STI section of MAINTAINERS, so rectify that.

regards,

Peter.

Changes in v2:
- Update commit to explicitly say no ABI breakage (Rob)
- Rebase series on v4.0-rc6 (Pete)
- Collect up Acks (Pete)
