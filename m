It pisses of a lot of people who really insist upon accurate timing. I
think a better fix would be to have a dotclock range in drm_panel, and
some magic to figure out which one of these we can actually do. Then
tell userspace that this is the mode is should request. That way
userspace knows what the actual dotclock/refresh rate is, and the
panel still works.
