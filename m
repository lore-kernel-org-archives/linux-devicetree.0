It would be nice to have this description of why you want to add this in
the commit message proper.

I don't see much point in this. If we're going to add this to the DTSIs
for all platforms that have CPUs with LPAE support, why not just check
if a given DT contains one of those CPUs to find out if it has LPAE
support?

The information this flag describes is at best redundant, but could also
be missing or present erroneously. 

It's also of no use to any OS actually running on the hardware, as it's
easier for an OS to check ID_MMFR0[3:0] than to parse a DTB. Likewise
for bootloaders.

I think if we want an early warning that a particular platform is not
going to support LPAE, this would be a better place to put it.

It's a shame we don't have a standard header in the Linux Image. If we
did, we could add a "uses LPAE" flag to the Linux Image that bootloaders
could check and refuse to run the Image or print a warning if the HW had
no LPAE support.

Thanks,
Mark.
