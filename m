I think we don't need to do anything. Basically machine name is always
"Qualcomm MSM (Flattened Device Tree)" but then the model name in the
devicetree blob says a more descriptive value "Qualcomm MSM8960 CDP" or
"Qualcomm MSM8660 SURF", etc. All this info is printed in the kernel log
upon boot:

[    0.000000] Machine: Qualcomm MSM (Flattened Device Tree), model: Qualcomm MSM8960 CDP


In fact, it should be possible to put the two dt board files together at
some point if we can somehow drive the map_io routine from devicetree.
In this case we could even have the same machine descriptor used for
both machines.
