Thanks, Arnd.

So, it is IP CORE LIB (you suggest) vs IP CORE Platform Driver
(dwc3, musb, chipidea) you are talking about, right? Except for
creating another platform driver as well as related DT node (optional),
are there any advantages compared to current IP core driver structure?

In this thread, we are talking about creating common platform driver for glue
layer, its design purpose (adapt it for as many as platforms) should be the
same, no matter the IP core part is a LIB or platform driver, am I missing
something?
