Not entirely...

...this is more the point.  Perhaps the constraints language needs
improvement here?

The trouble with this sort of interface is that it's a quick and dirty
way for people to bodge around things rather than actually fixing them
properly.  Of course sometimes fixing things properly is really hard and
that means we want a temporary bodge but having to put them in DT is
really unfortunate.
