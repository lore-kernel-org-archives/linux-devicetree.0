Ok, thanks for the explanation. This means there is no strict relation
between the SS and HS ports and we have to represent them separately.

I can also see what you explained now on my PC by plugging in a couple
of devices into a hub on a single SS port:

/:  Bus 04.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/2p, 5000M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/4p, 5000M
        |__ Port 1: Dev 4, If 0, Class=Mass Storage, Driver=usb-storage, 5000M
        |__ Port 4: Dev 3, If 0, Class=Vendor Specific Class, Driver=ax88179_178a, 5000M
/:  Bus 03.Port 1: Dev 1, Class=root_hub, Driver=xhci_hcd/2p, 480M
    |__ Port 1: Dev 3, If 0, Class=Hub, Driver=hub/4p, 480M
        |__ Port 2: Dev 5, If 0, Class=Wireless, Driver=btusb, 12M
        |__ Port 2: Dev 5, If 1, Class=Wireless, Driver=btusb, 12M

In this case, the DT representation would be


	usb@... { /* host controller and root hub */

		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

				reg = <1>;

					     "usb0a12,class224.1.1",
					     "usb0a12,class224.1",
					     "usb0a12,class224";
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;
				reg = <2>;

				wireless@0,0 { /* bluetooth config 0, if 0 */
					compatible = "usbif0a12,0001.134.config0.0",
							"usbif0a12,0001.config0.0",
							"usbif0a12,class224.1.1",

							"usbif,class224.1.1",
							"usbif,class224.1",

					reg = <0 0>;
				};

				wireless@0,1 { /* bluetooth config 0, if 1 */
					compatible = "usbif0a12,0001.134.config0.1",
							"usbif0a12,0001.config0.1",
							"usbif0a12,class224.1.1",
							"usbif0a12,class224.1",
							"usbif0a12,class224",

					reg = <0 0>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

In that description, I have included all four kinds of nodes from
the spec: host controller, device (wireless@2), interface (wireless@0.1,
wireless@0.2) and combined (hub@1, hub@3, storage@1, communications@4).

Peter's example only contained hubs in combined nodes, no device or
interface nodes. I wonder if the code is able to parse all four
kinds of nodes though, and if we actually need that.

Do we have a 'struct device' for each interface?

Is it possible to have a hub in an interface of a multifunction device
or are they always single-configuration single-interface devices?
