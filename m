Theoretical. I don't know how likely having a non-existant device
enabled is to cause problems.

Yeah, but now if a bug is found in the device tree it has to be fixed
once per distro instead of only on mainline.

What about the idea of keeping the current dt for the most featureful
variant and creating new dts for the other two?

That would make it so that no one's device stops working and would
have mailine support for all three devices.

Also, the current device tree doesn't represent any existing device:
it has wifi on but no emmc. That variation does not exist.
