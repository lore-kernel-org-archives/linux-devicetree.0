"We put this random collection of status bits in to a register somewhere
because it was convenient for the h/w engineers" is pretty common, I think.

I don't think it's going to be any easier for the boot loader, which
is quite possibly totally uninterested in PCI and would have
no reason to need to prod this location on the versatilepb. I also trust
the kernel much more to get bugfixes and be easily updatable. I appreciate
that it's more work for you if you can't just say "punt this nastiness
to the bootloader", but I think it's also the better (more robust
and self-contained) design.
