I haven't strong opinion on the file names. The qcom prefix is the one
which annoying me. If you look at /drivers/mfd the company name prefixes
are very few.

The *compatible* strings are the important thing here. So If MFD
maintainer is fine with this name I'm fine too.

OK, I understand the need of atomic context, but pmic_arb_read_cmd() and
pmic_arb_write_cmd() functions use raw_spin_lock_irqsave already. Isn't
those locks enough?

OK, I'm fine with this suggestion.
