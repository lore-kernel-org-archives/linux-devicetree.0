The way we handle wakeup interrupts in the core prevents that, because
wakeup is handled at the IRQ level rather than at a handler (irqaction)
level.  Interrupt handlers from irqactions are not run for wakeup
interrupts at all after suspend_device_irqs(), so if you have anyone
sharing an IRQ with a wakeup source, their interrupt handler won't be
run anyway then.

As I said, sharing an IRQ with a wakeup source is OK (worst case you'll
cause spurious wakeup interrupts to occur if your device is not suspended
properly).  The problem is *entirely* about IRQF_NO_SUSPEND.

Moreover, I don't think any watchdogs have a legitimate reason to use
IRQF_NO_SUSPEND, because quite frankly if you don't want your watchdog
to abort system suspends in progress, then you have no reason to run that
watchdog during system suspend at all.  Conversely, if you want the watchdog
to abort system suspends in progress, its wakeup interrupt should be a wakeup
one.

So I claim that the only things having legitimate reasons to ever use
IRQF_NO_SUSPEND are (a) timers and (b) IPIs.  There really are no other
cases to worry about in my view, but I may be overlooking something.

Anyway, I wouldn't like to add flags allowing driver writers to do fishy
things in a hush-hush manner.  The warning trigger is there for a good
reason and if we allow it to be avoided, that has to be for a good reason
too.  In other words, it shouldn't be too easy to do that.
