That is true, but I do have a concern that bolting more and more
info onto the side of DT may leave us with a mess, while the "main"
tree becomes increasingly fictional.

You make a lot of good points -- apologies for not responding in detail
to all of them yet, but I tie myself in knots trying to say too many
different things at the same time.


For comparison, here's what I think is the main alternative approach.
My discussion touches obliquely on some of the issues you raise...


My basic idea is that DT allows us to express master/slave relationships
like this already:

	master_device {
		slave_device {
			reg = < ... >;
			ranges = < ... >;
			dma-ranges = < ... >;
		};
	};

(dma-ranges is provided by ePAPR to describe the reverse mappings for
slave_device to master back on master_device).

In a multi-master system this isn't enough, because a node might have
to have multiple parents in order to express all the master/slave
relationships.

In that case, we can choose one of the parents as the canonical one
(e.g., the immediate master on the path from the coherent CPUs), or if
there is no obvious canonical parent the child node can be a
freestanding node in the tree (i.e., with no reg or ranges properties,
either in the / { } junkyard, or in some location that makes topological
sense for the device in question).  The DT herarchy retains real
meaning since the direction of master/slave relationships is fixed,
but the DT becomes a tree of connected trees, rather than a single tree.

So, some master/slave relationships will not be child/parent any more,
and we need another way to express the linkage.


My idea now, building on Will's suggestion is to keep the existing
abstractions unchanged, but create an alternate "detached"
representation of each relationship, to use in multi-master
situations.


In the following, the #address-cells and #size-cells properties of a
and b (where applicable) control the parsing of REG or RANGE in
precisely the same way for both forms.

SLAVE-PORT is required for slave buses with multiple masters, but it
is only needed in systems where the ports need to be identified
distinctly.  DT has no traditional way to describe this, so we'd need
to add another property ("parent-master" in my example) if we want to
describe that in tree form.  For now, I assume that a device (i.e., a
slave that is not a bus) does not need to need to distinguish between
different slave ports -- if it did need to do so, additional
properties could be added to describe that, but we have no example of
this today(?)

Drivers for buses that use SLAVE-PORT could still work with a DT that
does not provide the SLAVE-PORT information, but might have restricted
functionality in that case (no per-port control, profiling, etc.)


Note also that:

	{ #slave-cells = <0>; } is equivalent to { // no #slave-cells }
	{ parent-master = <>; } is equivalent to { // no parent-master }

...which gives the correct interpretation for traditional DTs.


We then have the following transformations:


Slave device mapping, tree form:
	a {
		b {
			reg = < REG >;
		};
	};

Slave device mapping, detached form:
	a {
		slave-reg = < &b REG >;
	};

	b {
	};


Slave passthrough bus mapping, tree form:
	a {
		b {
			#slave-cells = < SLAVE-PORT-CELLS >;
			parent-master = < SLAVE-PORT >;

			ranges;
		};
	};

Slave passthrough bus mapping, detached form:
	a {
		slave = < &b SLAVE-PORT >;
	};

	b {
		#slave-cells = < SLAVE-PORT-CELLS >;
	};


Remapped slave bus mapping, tree form:
	a {
		b {
			#slave-cells = < SLAVE-PORT-CELLS >;
			parent-master = < SLAVE-PORT >;

			ranges = < RANGE >;
		};
	};

Remapped slave bus mapping, detached form:
	a {
		slave = < &b SLAVE-PORT RANGE >;
	};

	b {
		#slave-cells = < SLAVE-PORT-CELLS >;
	};


There are no dma-ranges properties here, because in this context "DMA"
is just a master/slave relationship where the master isn't a CPU.
The added properties actually allow us to describe that just fine, but
in a more explicit and general way.


Some new code will be required to parse this, but it is just a new
more flexible _mechanism_ for expressing an old relationship, extended
with a straightforward slave-port identifier which is a simple array of
cells, we should have a good chance of burying the change under
abstracted interfaces.

Existing DTs should not need to change, because we have a well-defined
mapping between the two representations in the non-multi-master case.

I may try to come up with a partial description of the Zync SoC, but
I was getting myself confused when I tried it earlier ;)
