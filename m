A useful binding that abstracted things sufficiently to allow multiple
devices would be one which contained some information about the contents
of the chip.

The issue is the tastefulness.  Just looking at the binding it's
immediately clear that the only thing that the extra levels of
indirection are adding is the removal of the mfd_add_cells() call from
the MFD driver which isn't particularly helping anything and is
basically Linux specific.

Sure, but this binding doesn't do anything like that.  If it said things
like "there's a PDM speaker driver with register map X at address Y"
then you'd have a block you could easily pick up and reuse when defining
another device but it doesn't do that at all.

This isn't a "cheat a little bit" type thing - it's really not talking
about blocks that are likely to reappear elsewhere in exactly the same
form on a device that's different enough that you'd be able to add some
useful reuse via the device tree.

With CODECs the IP blocks you see are generally things like audio
interfaces, mixers, PLLs, amplifiers and so on.  New devices that are
meaningfully different to software will generally be some new
combination of that sort of stuff rather than a straight clone of the
chip top level which is what this binding is talking about.

The difference I'm seeing here is that the split in the device tree here
is at such that it's the equivalent of having a single device tree node
for the entire clock tree of a given OMAP model - it's just completely
redundant, it's not adding any additional information beyond the top
level information about which chip this is.

This code handles exactly one chip and looking at it it's *extremely*
hard to see it as a useful abstraction for multiple chips.  There's also
the fact that with things like this where the chip has to be hooked up
to other pieces of the system it makes much more of a difference than it
might otherwise since it's much more externally visible.  In this
particular case for example we might want to split the clocking out
differently as the generic clock API comes along, and there's extcon
too.  All of which should be entirely Linux internal things.

If I could see how this would allow reuse I'd probably agree with you
but I really can't - it's immediately obvious looking at what's there
that all that's happening is that a bit of the Linux internals that's
not particularly great as a generic abstraction dropped straight into
the device tree.

Plus there's the fact that from both a device tree and a code point of
view it's utterly trivial to not land ourselves with this in the device
tree, it's just registering two devices and using a different of_node
for reading properties in code and removing a layer of indentation in
the DT.
