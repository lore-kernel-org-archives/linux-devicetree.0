This looks interesting. The simple cases end up quite simple. I wonder
what's the best way to handle the more complex cases; more on that below.

Should those save the GPIO flags too? Or, do we assume that gpiod-based
GPIOs already handle the flags inside the gpiod API?

I wonder if it makes sense to handle pure data here, or whether this
only makes sense for resources/services that are provided by some other
device?

I guess it's nice for all resources and configuration to come through to
probe() in the same way, but I rather wonder how we'd handle bindings
that have large custom (driver-specific) tables of data. Would be simply
defer such things to custom code in probe()? If so, it feels slightly
inconsistent to handle some data in the probe_list[] and some in code in
probe(). Still, I guess there's something to be said for keeping the
simple cases simple.

What about the case where some resources are optional, or only required
based on the values of certain other properties? I suppose that probe()
could call devm_probe() multiple times, with different probe_list[]s,
based on whatever algorithm they need.
