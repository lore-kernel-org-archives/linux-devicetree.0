This patch set adds a DT binding documentation for new 'clock-parents'
and 'clock-rates' DT properties and a helper function to parse them.
The helper is now being called from within the driver core, similarly
as it is done for the pins configuration binding to a device.

Patch 1/2 adds a variant of of_clk_get() function which accepts name of
a DT property containing list of phandle + clock specifier pairs, as
opposed to hard coded "clocks" property name in of_clk_get().
As Mike suggested I've renamed this function to of_clk_get_by_property().

Patch 2/2 actually adds the code searching for related DT properties at
device node and performing re-parenting and/or clock frequency setting
as specified.

Changes since v1:
 - updated DT binding documentation,
 - dropped the platform bus notifier, the clock setup routine is now
   being called directly from the driver core before a driver probe() call;
   this has an advantage such as all bus types are handled and any errors
   are propagated, so that, for instance a driver probe() can be deferred
   also when resources specified by clock-parents/clock-rates properties
   are not yet available; an alternative would be to let drivers call
   of_clk_device_setup() directly,
 - dropped the patch adding a macro definition for maximum DT property
   name length for now.

Open issues:
 - handling of errors from of_clk_get_by_property() could be improved,
   currently ENOENT is returned by this function not only for a null
   entry.

This series has been tested on ARM, on Exynos4412 Trats2 board.
