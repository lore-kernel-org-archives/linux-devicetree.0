Ugh, right - we ripped out that code because there's no sensible use
case for it so now we don't keep the cards on a list.  The expectation
is that if someone is going around removing bits of the card they can
probably figure out that they should be removing the card first.

In any case the place to implement this is in the core, there's nothing
special about your cards here.  Either the core should be using the
component framework or the card list should be resurrected and we open
code it.  This isn't something that's unique to your device.
