These are very good reasons.

We already have one DMA implementation drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-dmaengine.c
which was sneaked past us and put into kernel with proper review!

On the other hand we have *bunch* of dmaengine users in crypto subsystem
which use dmaengine drivers and APIs and are good citizens. It allows folks
to share code with other usages of dmaengine and the usual arguments for
common code and frameworks...

If there are enough users we can add up a crypto-dmaengine lib which
programs dma controller for crypto users and avoid open coding for everyone.
for example sound-dmaengine layers does that...
