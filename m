My opinion is the exact opposite.

If you create a custom schema language, you have to develop:

* An entire new language specification, and perhaps syntax to represent
the schema.

* A new parser (if not lexer).

* Keep extending that as new schemas require more and more different
validation that wasn't originally considered.

Once we've specified every schema, we'll end up having had to invent a
completely new Turing-complete language.

However, if schemas are simply C code, you simply write code to validate
the data. In my opinion, nothing could be simpler. Everyone working on
the kernel is already familiar with C. We can refactor common patterns
into function calls so people don't have to re-implement it.

I don't see any reason why the C schema checker couldn't be linked into
the kernel and applied at run-time, assuming we take a little care to
write is as a library we call from dtc, rather than something closely
coupled with dtc's internals. (Or implement it as a separate app).

(Note that there's a bit more information in a .dts that a DTB, so some
schema checking might be harder on a DTB). For example, phandle
references are just another cell in the binary, but have a unique syntax
in the source.
