Hi folks, 

This set moves firmware specific implementations of the device / fwnode 
property API to locations that are specific to firmware implementation, 
still leaving property set (which isn't really firmware) implementation in
drivers/base/property.c.

This set depends on the OF patches here:

<URL:https://git.linuxtv.org/sailus/media_tree.git/log/?h=of>

NOTE: These patches are going in through another tree and may not be
merged yet.

The patches this set and the dependencies may be found with dependencies
here:

<URL:https://git.linuxtv.org/sailus/media_tree.git/log/?h=acpi-graph-cleaned>

since v5:

- Rewrap fwnode_property_read_int_array() to match the layout of the rest
  of the file.

- Add Reviewed-by from Mika.

since v4:

- Address Mika's comments on line wrapping and indentation.

- Order acpi_fwnode_get_parent() according to the list of operations in
  struct fwnode_operations.

- Add patch "device property: Add fwnode_graph_get_port_parent" to the set.

since v3:

- The two first patches have been already merged ("device property: Read
  strings using string array reading functions" and "device property:
  Implement fwnode_get_next_parent()).

- Add "ACPI: Constify argument to acpi_device_is_present()".

- Add patch "device property: Introduce fwnode_device_is_available()".

- Add "device property: Add FW type agnostic fwnode_graph_get_remote_node".

- Rebase on current linux-pm master and fwnode cleanup patchset here:

  <URL:http://www.spinics.net/lists/devicetree/msg177549.html>

- Add KernelDoc documentation for graph_parse_endpoint fwnode operation.

since v2:

- Move patches changing the implementation of reading strings and
  implementing fwnode_get_next_parent() using the fwnode interface alone
  in front of the set. I kept them separate as they do change the
  implementation of these operations.

- Merge patches adding the fwnode_operations and moving the
  implementations of the non-graph portions of the fwnode property API to
  firmware specific locations.

- Merge moving graph operations to the same struct into another patch.
  The graph operations in the ops struct are also added in this patch now.

since v1: 

- Move the three bugfixes in front of the set into a separate patchset. 
There are no dependencies to those from the rest of the patches.

- Rebase on current ACPI graph support patches (themselves on PM tree 
4.11-rc1 merge).
