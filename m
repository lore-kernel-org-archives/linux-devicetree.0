To clarify my suggestion: I am not saying we should disable the clock, I
am saying we should set the "status" property to "disabled" in Xen for
the clock used by the serial or passthrough devices (for which the
"status" property is already set to "disabled"). That should work for
cases where the clock is not shared among multiple devices.

If the clock is shared, then I don't think we would run into the issue
described by Dirk because I wouldn't imagine clk_disable_unused would
try to disable the clock anymore, because it would actually be in use
from Linux POV.
