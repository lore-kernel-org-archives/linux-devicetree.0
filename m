I did. You are adding GPIO support to the existing support. It would be
nice to separate that from add DT support.

Let me rephrase, if you completely ignore GPIO for a minute, what is the
issue. Just that irq_descs are sparsely allocated for the primary
controller. Then the GPIO interrupts are inserted into the middle of
that irq space. Handling sparse irqs is a potentially common problem, so
we should address that in the core irqdomain code.

To be clear, those are not holes in hwirq's, but many lines don't have
connections so you are not allocating Linux irqs for them. hwirq should
reflect interrupt numbers from the controller's perspective and be
directly usable to index to the correct register and bit mask. There's
no storage associated with a hwirq, so the only cost is iterating over
them which is not done frequently.

There is not a clean separation of the primary interrupt controller's
hwirq numbers and Linux irq numbers in your patch. Then you are
overlaying the GPIO interrupts into the Linux irq space.

I'm just trying to back-up some and understand the problem.

How about if .to_irq returns 0, the loop can just continue and skip over
that hwirq without error.

I don't think .each_hwirq is being used, so you can delete that.
