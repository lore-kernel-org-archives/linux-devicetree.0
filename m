Let me comment on this APM X-Gene driver. This driver is dead and
won't be supported in near or foreseeable future. And someday, it will
be ripped out. Based on experience, this solution (having PHY driver
in Linux) can't be supported across boards and etc as it is just too
much maintenance. And therefore, we followed Arnd B guidance and move
all this into the boot loader. From Linux or OS perspective, it only
cares about the interface in which its interface with. This is just
your reference and may be this will help you as well.
