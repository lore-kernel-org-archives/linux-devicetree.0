Hmm...the patch only renames big_endian_data to is_msb_first.

So whatever the problem of LS1 is, this change doesn't matter to LS1
at all unless LS1 has a specific property in its DT binding: If using
is_msb_first works for LS1, using big_endian_data without applying
this patch does work as well, doesn't it?

I think this patch is more likely making the binding explicit so that
any platform like LS1 will not miss the essential property. Then the
commit comments could have mentioned it if so.

I'm looking forward to your new version. And I give you an extra info
about SAI on i.MX. It should be configured as Little Endian and MSB
first. So with the current DT binding it doesn't have big_endian*
properties. Any replacement for big_endian_data shall be compatible
to this case as well as I mentioned in the previous reply.

Thank you,
Nicolin
