It is used in the arm64 specific patch that I have dropped out of my
pull request. After discussions with Catalin I will add the patch back
into the tree that you've pulled from as he is OK with your tree carryi=
ng
the whole package.

I need to ask for some guidance here: for addressing some of your comme=
nts
and Rob's I can add more patches in my v11 branch and you can pull them
when you think they are ready. But one of your comments was requesting
splitting a patch into two blocks - one that moves of_pci_range_to_reso=
urce()
into drivers/of/address.c and one that fixes it's behaviour - and I don=
't
know how you would like that handled. Should I revert the original patc=
h
and add the new ones, or should I rebase the whole series into a differ=
ent
branch that you can pull from?

Best regards,
Liviu
