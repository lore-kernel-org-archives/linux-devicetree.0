Best of all is to do more work in public, including sending the acks
on the list.

If you look around, it's relatively unusual that people post pre-acked
or pre-reviewed patches, even corporate contributors.

Yeah, we've been asking for (at least) dual GPL/BSD. This was the
first time I noticed BSD-only which is why I brought it up.

I suspect it is not an issue in reality.

Ok, good. I've found there to be a slight drawback in upstreaming a
system dtb before there's basic device support since it can't be used
to determine whether a board is expected to have basic functionality
or not.

As long as it's in progress there's no big reason to hold off though.
