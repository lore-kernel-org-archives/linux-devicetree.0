I understand your difficulty!  I was just wanting something to clarify the 
meaning of the value without reference to the driver source.

You could add something like this to your existing explanation: "The value
describes which audio input pins are selected; this varies depending
on chip type so consult the section on audio port configuration in the 
relevant datasheet.".
