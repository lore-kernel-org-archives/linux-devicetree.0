Hi Joshua,

The DT bindings will need Rob Herring's ack.  The bitrev.h
changes will need Russell King's ack.

I've made some comments on patch 3/3 but it looks good to me
besides that.

Once we have those other acks, please submit your v4 including fixes
for my comments and whatever else comes up.  I'm hoping it will be
minor and with that done, v4 can go in.

When you send in v4, please also cc our new mailing list that Moritz
made: linux-fpga@vger.kernel.org
