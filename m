Thanks.

I'm surprised an 80+ character compatible stream is okay. The parts
giving me heartburn here are not mentioned in the previous discussion
nor the QCDT format.

As presented previously I agree with the push back. However, we could
do standard properties for SOC and board versions rather than
something vendor specific. Then the existing kernel support for
versions could use it. We could also just make this compatible string
formatting standard for more than just QC boards.

For mb, can't the tool just parse the memory node to get ram size
rather than parsing the compatible.

Dealing with multiple panels is fairly common. I think you could use
an alias to the panel node and match using its compatible or
resolution.

Again, perhaps an alias would work here.

Okay, then please say "SPMI USID" or something.

I'm generally okay with the former. It's the latter that I don't like
so much. I'd like Arnd's thoughts here given he had many of the
comments.
