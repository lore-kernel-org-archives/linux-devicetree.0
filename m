As far as I know, no.  Adding VRM logic to sum RPMh client load current
requests, compare the sums to thresholds, select corresponding modes, and
override with explicit modes was determined to be too complex for RPMh.
Instead, much simpler max aggregation was implemented along with design
guidelines for PMICs to ensure that mode values are ordered from strictly
lower to higher power.

Take care,
David
