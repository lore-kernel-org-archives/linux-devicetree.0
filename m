Hi Mike,

This is the latest patch series of the Broadcom iProc clock driver that
I was talking about. I believe it has addressed your previous code
review comments by switching to use assigned-clocks/assigned-clock-rates
for configuring PLL clock at the time of clock registration.

Please have a look and let us know if this can be pulled in.

Thanks,

Ray
