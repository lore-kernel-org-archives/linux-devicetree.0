Resending from the correct account.

In the "simplified diagram," TI shows a single AVDD/DVDD/HP_VDD supply:

http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tas5717.pdf#2

Page 20 also suggests the use of a single 3.3V supply for AVDD/DVDD/HP_VDD.

But this combines a number of separate pins.  On 5711 we have
dedicated pins for:

PVDD_A
PVDD_B
PVDD_C
PVDD_D
AVDD
DVDD

On 5717 we have dedicated pins for:

PVDD_AB
PVDD_CD
AVDD
DVDD
HPVDD

I didn't see anything in the datasheet suggesting it is OK to have
different voltages or power states on the various supply pins (other
than the special voltage on PVDD).

I can add as many regulator entries as appropriate.  What do you recommend?
