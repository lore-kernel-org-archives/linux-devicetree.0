Hi,

Indeed, my changelog was not really clear, here is the reworded one that will land in v2 :
"
This patch add nodes for the Mali-450 MP3 GPU present in the GXBB and GXL SoCs.

For GXBB, the node is simply added in the meson-gxbb.dtsi file.

Fox GXL, since the GXM dtsi is a superset of the GXL dtsi, the Mali node is added to
the GXL SoC specific dtsi files via an intermediate "meson-gxl-mali.dtsi" file to avoid
having an invalid Mali-450 node in the GXM device tree.
"

Thanks,
Neil
