The only registers we have available are; read_irq_value,
set_irq_value, clear_irq_value, read_enable_value, set_enable_value
and clear_enable_values.

This controller doesn't claim ownership of anything.  It essentially
just turns IRQs on and off.

I know for a fact that the 'catchers' in sti_mbox_tx_is_ready() to
fire, because I have triggered them.  I'd really rather keep this
harmless check in.

Okay, thanks for the clarification, I will remove these lines.

That's not the case for this controller.  There is nothing preventing
these values from changing on a new board revisions.  After all, this
isn't really a Controller IP per-say.

AFAIK, all current platforms do use this mapping, so I can change it
with a view to changing it back if a different set of offsets appear
in subsequent incarnations.  But again, I think it's pretty harmless.
