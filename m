okay, will fix it in next version.

Sorry I should have done that earlier. TRM is available here[1], Section 9.3 
talks about Interrupt Router, Section 10.2.7 talks about Interrupt aggregator. 
Documentation for TISCI IRQ management is available here[2].

Sure, will try to post the consolidated series asap. Thanks a lot for the help.
