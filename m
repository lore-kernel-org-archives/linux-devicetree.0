Can we please use "amlogic,s905x", "amlogic,meson-gxl"? No need to
complicate the name. Also affects .dtsi and .dts below.

Is that its official name? No objection, just wondering whether we need
both GXL and S905X in the name, and then again the SoC name at all if
the P212 is unique. Haven't compared the previous Pxxx ones.
