Hm, that would need two interrupt parents since the main interrupt for
the GPIO's would still be GIC...

It actually allows to configure pull-up/downs, that is why I chose to
implement it as a GPIO controller. Although the pull-up/down part is not
implemented yet.

But when I think about it, it actually is probably more a pinctrl with
interrupt capabilities?
