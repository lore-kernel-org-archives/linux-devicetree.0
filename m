I assume that sentence is meant to say something more specific:

This binding is intended to apply to pin controllers where each pin has
an independently selectable mux function.

"A pin controller ..." sounds like a general statement that is intended
to apply to any pin controller. If that were intended, the statement you
made certainly wouldn't be true.

Within each of the nodes, the binding for pinmux is defined
independently by each pin controller. I don't have any /strong/
objection to any particular pin controller using this binding, or even
it being re-used across many similar pin controllers, or even being
the/a default binding style for new pin controllers.

I'm not totally sure whether blending the pin ID and mux function ID
into the same value is a good idea. That said, it does have advantages
as you state, and shouldn't cause any significant issues. In any case
where it would be a bad idea, the binding for the pin controller in
question can still choose to use some more appropriate binding, so
allowing this binding for some controllers won't force issues onto other
controllers. So, it seems fine.

Note however that we can't change existing bindings. Well, I suppose
certain bindings could be enhanced to support either a string-based or
an integer-base binding, but I don't think that'd be a good idea.
