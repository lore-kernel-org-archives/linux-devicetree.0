Generally, the may be 2/3/4 timers, and each timers will have at most
3 coounters.
Each counters will have 3 matches. Each counter may have its own
interrupts, or share same
interrupts(counter1 has one interrupts, counter2 and 3 share one). It depends on
how SOC connets the signals.

The DT will be
timer 0 {
     ...
     ...
     counter0 {
     };
     counter2 {
     };
}

"apb" frequency is only used to calculated the delay loop.
I do not want to fix the delay loop in the driver.
So pass it in DT directly will make the things easier to handle.

"fastclk" is a clock input. So waht do you mean "described as clock inputs"?

SOCes may have 2 or 3 or 4 timers, some timers may be used by CP not AP but
AP can still access it.
There may be UP SOC, or SMP SOC. So there are may be some general usage
1. UP SOC: need one clocksource, need one clock event device
2. SMP SOC: need one clocksource, need one broadcast clock event device because
   arch timer will be shutdown when core is down
3. SMP SOC: it has bug with arch timer. So need one clock source,
NR_CPUs clock event
    device to replace the arch timer. There are may be 2 cores or 4 cores.


Above requeimetns are also hardware requriments from SOCes.

The driver will be used for many SOCes, we can not to fix the counter
usage in driver.

The counter does not have its own register space. They are belongs to a timer.
Counter does not need to map the regsiter spance, it is done by timer.
For example, for counter enable, all coutners share same register. CER
For interrupt enable, each counter has its own register. IERx

So if we use like "reg = <IERx offset>", i do not see any benefit. while
direct setting "marvell,timer-counter-id" seems make the DT more clear.

The interrupt topolog is designed by SOCes.
Each counter has one interrupt, but SOCes may connects some coutners' interrupt
into one.
In timer driver, we do not care about it. We depeneds on IRQ chip to handle it.

For some SMP SOCes, for example, marvell's pxa988/pxa1088/pxa1L88
They have bug in arch timer. So we make each CPU to have one dedicated
counter to replace the arch timer.

It is the rating when register clock source and clock event.
I think i can fix it in the driver.

For some SMP soces, for example, marvell's pxa988/pxa1088/pxa1L88
They have bug in arch timer. So we make each CPU to have one dedicated
counter to replace the arch timer. So for these SOCes, broadcast timer is not
needed. For these counters, we have to set IRQ affinity to the specific core.

For some SMP soces, for example, they can use arch timer, but we have
to register
a clock event device for broadcast because we lose arch timer if core is down.
For this coutner, we have to set IRQ affinity to ALL cores.

For a broadcast timer, there is feature "CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_DYNIRQ".
This feature is a clock event device's fearture. It means that the
clock event device's irq can
be set to any core.
In fact it does not for all SOCes that the interrupt of the counter
can be set to any core.
