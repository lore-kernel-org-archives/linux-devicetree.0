The patch documening the DT bindings should be ordered before the patch which adds
the DT node to aid reviewing.

st40-proc isn't used anywhere. The stih407 doesn't have a ST40 copro, and
looking in the vendor tree remoteproc support isn't present for stih415/6 which
are the the only upstream SoC's to have a ST40 co-pro.

So I think st40-rproc support can be removed.

pwr_reset isn't used by any of the st231 co-processors. It seems to
be related to ST40 support which I don't think is required upstream.
Removing it would make the driver a fair bit smaller.

I can't see any co-pro which uses more than one clock, so clock-names looks
superflous.

I would prefer to see this binding match how most other sti drivers reference syscfg
registers which is: -

st,syscfg       = <&syscfg_core 0xf4>;

Description: phandle of sysconfig bank plus integer array containing register offsets.

It also means it is easily extendable if more than one syscfg register is
required in the future to boot a co-pro.

Peter.
