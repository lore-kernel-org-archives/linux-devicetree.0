yes, we need to move everybody to use struct phy, instead of struct
usb_phy.

This means we have a little ground work to do before we can add your phy
driver to that framework, right ? As I said, if the framework is missing
anything, work with Kishon (generic phy maintainer) to add those missing
pieces generically.

because extcon is the API to use for external connectors. The same way
you use regulator framework to control that single GPIO tied to an
enable signal of a fixed regulator, you use extcon when you need to read
that gpio signal tied to id pin of the USB connector.

extcon is used to hide gpio_request from dwc2. dwc2 only knows about
extcon, not gpios. extcon will request the gpio and use it as interrupt
source. When an IRQ fires, it will read the gpio state and decide if it
should broadcast a message to tell dwc2 to become host or peripheral.

sure, but does it make a difference if you let gpiolib handle debouncing
for you ? It makes no difference at all, right ?
