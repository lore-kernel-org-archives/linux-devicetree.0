No, I was thinking you'd add include/dt-bindings/include-prefix/ to
the include path instead of scripts/dtc/include-prefix/. The only
downside I can see is people could mistakenly do:

#include <dt-bindings/include-prefix/$arch/foo.dtsi>

True, but the same can be said that "scripts/dtc" is not includes nor
kernel build infrastructure.

That would just break every existing include in dts files.

Another idea. Could kbuild create all the symlinks at build time instead?
