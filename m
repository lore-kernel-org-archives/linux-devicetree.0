I don't think anything in this register changes unless we reset the CPU
or software changes it, right? We already have a hotplug notifier to
handle the case where the CPU is hotplugged out (and may get reset) and
we need to reset the PMU. The other case is deep idle, which we don't
have yet but we'll need to do a save/reset/restore across idle when we
get there. So it seems possible to move it to the PMU reset path.
