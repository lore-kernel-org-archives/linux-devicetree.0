Keystone2 devices are used on more platforms than just Texas
Instruments reference evaluation platforms called EVMs. Providing a
generic compatible "ti,keystone" is not sufficient to differentiate
various SoC definitions possible on various platforms. So, provide
compatible matches for each SoC family by itself.

This allows SoC specific logic to be run time handled based on
of_machine_is_compatible("ti,k2hk") or as needed for the dependent
processor instead of needing to use board dependent compatibles that
are needed now.
