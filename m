You still haven't said of what exactly it's getting in the way of.

Clocks and reset are the only thing set so far, because we need
reference to them from the DT itself, nothing more.

We could very much have more devices instatiated from the MFD itself.

No, this is really not a bus. It shouldn't be described at all as
such. It is a device, that has multiple functionnalities in the system
=> MFD. It really is that simple.

Which was nacked in the first place because such offsets are not
supposed to be in the DT.

Really, we have something that work here, there's no need to refactor
it.

And this breaks the SMP bringup code.
