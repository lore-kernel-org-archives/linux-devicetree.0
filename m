Thanks once again for your review and response!

I don't think dma API was meant to support hardware like pkt dma and was the
reason quoted when this driver was introduced and the same is valid even
today. AFAIK, Without hacking the API, we will not be able to support our
driver even today. Besides Keystone itself is an old platform that is
matured and have been there for long. K2G SoC was also introduced almost
3 years ago and we were late to port it to upstream due to various reasons.
We now have the SoC and most of the drivers upstreamed and this is a
missing driver to support networking. Given that we don't have any other
new devices planned from this SoC familty in the future, and the platform
itself is old and matured, I don't think the extra effort needed to
explore DMA API usage and re-write the driver is justified. 

knav dma API is a TI SoC specific driver API and IMO, it should be fine\
to extend it to support probe deferral. I have also looked at the driver
and I don't see any other way to handle this since the channels are
allocated and used in ndo_open() and EPROBE_DEFER is not useful here.

Btw, I will re-write patch 3/5 as you have suggested as there is scope
for adding one more patch besides what I have mentioned in my response.
I will be sending v2 of the series soon with your comment on 3/5 addressed.

Regards,

Murali
