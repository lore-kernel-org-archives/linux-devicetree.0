I appreciate your efforts towards making a common driver but IMO it would be 
better to create a separate driver for the OV9655 sensor.  The original driver 
is 1576 lines of code, your patch set adds half of that (816).  There are
significant differences in the feature set of both sensors, there are 
differences in the register layout.  I would go for a separate driver, we  
would then have code easier to follow and wouldn't need to worry about possible
regressions.  I'm afraid I have lost the camera module and won't be able 
to test the patch set against regressions.

IMHO from maintenance POV it's better to make a separate driver. In the end 
of the day we wouldn't be adding much more code than it is being done now.
