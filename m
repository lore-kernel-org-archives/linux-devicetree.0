Hi,

I still think this is fundamentally the wrong approach. We shouldn't have
created these file links in the first place.

I'd rather have something like this in our tree:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/include/arm -> ../../../../arm/boot/dts
arch/arm64/boot/dts/include/arm64 -> ../..
arch/arm/boot/dts/include/arm64 -> ../../../../arm64/boot/dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/include/arm -> ../..


That way you can include by using <arm/bcm2835-rpi.dtsi> instead.

You'll populate another (or the same) directory with links as appropriate
in your out-of-tree version of the DT contents.

No more symlinked files, and still a clear way of showing that you're
referencing contents out of the other architecture.

Considerably cleaner, isn't it?
