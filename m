0 and -1 are treated the same way in the graph code.

Ports should be separate data streams. Can the hlcdc have more than 1
data stream (I think I checked that)? If not, then more than 1 port
will never be needed. Likewise, a panel is pretty much never going to
have 2 ports (or endpoints). The hlcdc could have more than 1 endpoint
if you have multiple connections, but that's not what's defined. If
you have an 'endpoint' node, then having #address-cells/#size-cells is
wrong without a reg prop and unit-address.
