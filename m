I'd rather that we only describes those that we can probe from the
PMCEID* registers, and for the rest, left the user to consult a manual.

I can well imagine future variants of this IP supporing different
events, and I'd prefer to avoid poriflerating tables for those.

I guess that can be useful, though the cpumasks we expose today are
confusing as-is, and this is another point of confusion.

We could drop this for now, and add it when requested, or we should try
to make the naming clearer somehow -- "supported" can be read in a
number of ways.

Further, it would be worth documenting this PMU under
Documentation/perf/.

Regardless of how many instances there are, the core should *never*
add() a CPU-bound event (which DSU events are) on another CPU. To do so
would be a major bug.

So if this is just a paranoid check, we should WARN_ON_ONCE().
Otherwise, it's unnecessary.

Thanks. If you could add a comment as to why, that'll hopefully avoid
anyone trying to "fix" the logic later.

Ok.

Perhaps. We absolutely need to ensure that the driver makes the IRQ
affine to the active CPU, and no other SW will change the affinitiy of
the IRQ.

Otherwise, the IRQ handler is dangerous, violating locking requirements,
potentially corrupting memory, etc.

While I'm happy to have that as a paranoid sanity check, we cannot rely
upon that for correctness. We must ensure that we amange the interupt
affinity correctly.

If that means we need the forced affinity helpers, we must ensure that
we have access to those.

Thanks,
Mark.
