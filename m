Are you talking about the kirkwood driver or about things in general?

What you are saying is not true in general, if it is true for the kirkwood 
driver than the driver is broken in regards to DT bindings.

The specifier that follows after the phandle is hardware specific. This can 
be any number of integers. And the meaning of this is defined in the 
bindings specification for that hardware.

Many specifications define a binding in which either no specifier needs to 
be supplied, since there is only a single DAI, or one integer specifier 
which denotes which DAI is referenced for a multi-DAI controller. In the 
later case the bindings specification has to state which number maps to 
which physical DAI. Out of convenience many drivers use the same order as 
given in the bindings specification for their ASoC DAIs. Which is why the 
ASoC core provides a standard implementation for translating phandle + 
specifier to a ASoC DAI. But it is important to remember that the 
authoritative entity here is the bindings specification and not the driver.

If the bindings specification uses a different scheme for referencing the 
DAIs a custom xlate function needs to be provided by the driver confirms to 
this specification.

I don't understand how invoking the card builder from the CPU side audio 
controller driver will work. The audio controller driver does not know what 
card it is part of, so how does it decide which builder to call, and what 
happens in the case of multiple CPU side audio controllers involved in the 
same card. In rare cases there might not even be a CPU side audio controller 
involved at all.

I think this is something that needs to be done in the ASoC/ALSA core 
itself. Create the graph, wait until all endpoints of the graph have been 
registered and then create the card. Or something similar.
