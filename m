Grr... good catch.  I originally had this in kirkwood-dreamplug.dts,
which is always 200000000.  That's not the case in kirkwood.dtsi.  What
I would like to do, and I haven't had time to look into it (I thought I
would tackle it later as a refinement :-( ), is a reference of some
sort, eg:

in kirkwood.dtsi:

/ {
	compatible = "marvell,kirkwood";
	tclk:clock-frequency = <200000000>;

	wdt@fed20300 {
		compatible = "marvell,orion-wdt";
		reg = <0xfed20300 0x28>;
		clock-frequency = &tclk;
	};
};

then, in kirkwood-foobar.dts

/include/ "kirkwood.dtsi"

/ {
	model = "foobar";
	compatible = "...";
	tclk:clock-frequency = <166000000>;
};

but I'm not sure if that would work.

In any case, the simplest answer is to set clock-frequency in
kirkwood-dreamplug.dts as a root node property, and then each driver
that needs tclk, requests the clock-frequency from the root node.
Hopefully, Grant can chime in on this one.

Thanks for the review,

Jason.
