Thx Peter, 

Your review has been a great help.

Yes, approve! I should use WRITE_ONCE/READ_ONCE as necessary.

Test and set (spinlock & rwlock) is easier for debug :P, and I don't
know the details of queue-rwlock (maybe I should learn it).

arch/csky :)

Anyway, I just want to keep both of them.

Cool ... I like WRITE_ONCE style.

The same as above of spinlock.

Yes, no need ldex/stex and you've mentioned in spinlock before :P

I've really considered your advice before, but from abi view 610/807/810
all have csky_cmpxchg trap and we want to make them the same. Some apps
use the trap directly and not use libc api. Maybe we could delete the
trap in future version of kernel.

Thx peter and the two questions which I've clarified in above.
