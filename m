I was just trying to make the doc somewhat complete although I'm missing
msm.

They are all using the same code today, so yes thay are all compatible.
I'm not even sure that tegra is different than standard A9. I pulled
that from your tree. There are some h/w differences in terms of
powergating of the GIC or not and when. How to handle that is still
being hashed out a bit.

It's really about skipping the SGI interrupts and unused PPIs which is
h/w specific. That isn't really necessary AFAICT, but I'm not too sure
why it was even done in the first place.

Huh? Only Realview boards have a 2nd level controller. The Samsung
boards are using the VIC. Are you referring to something not in mainline
yet?

That would be interesting especially if gpio controllers were included.
It's probably overkill for just the few platforms that have multiple GICs.
