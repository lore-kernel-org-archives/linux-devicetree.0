Yes, and I'm not objecting this.

In any case it's discouraging to use platform data for GPIOs and plain
GPIO pin numbering.

I understand that.

It's hard to review (n+1) thousands of LOC.

OK.

To be more pedantic the new drivers do not have "minus" thousands LOC.

To logical ones.

What did prevent you to:
1. Introduce new driver
2. Switch to new driver
3. Remove old one.

...if you are not splitting it in the first place?

I can object this, but it will be no point except waste of time to
this discussion.

It's good that you considered several options. I suppose someone who
is on topic can do comprehensive review.
