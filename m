The `phy_tunable_id` has been named `ETHTOOL_PHY_EDPD` since it looks like
this feature is common across other PHYs (like EEE), and defining
`ETHTOOL_PHY_ENERGY_DETECT_POWER_DOWN` seems too long.

The way EDPD works, is that the RX block is put to a lower power mode,
except for link-pulse detection circuits. The TX block is also put to low
power mode, but the PHY wakes-up periodically to send link pulses, to avoid
lock-ups in case the other side is also in EDPD mode.

Currently, there are 2 PHY drivers that look like they could use this new
PHY tunable feature: the `adin` && `micrel` PHYs.

The ADIN's datasheet mentions that TX pulses are at intervals of 1 second
default each, and they can be disabled. For the Micrel KSZ9031 PHY, the
datasheet does not mention whether they can be disabled, but mentions that
they can modified.

The way this change is structured, is similar to the PHY tunable downshift
control:
* a `ETHTOOL_PHY_EDPD_DFLT_TX_MSECS` value is exposed to cover a default
  TX interval; some PHYs could specify a certain value that makes sense
* `ETHTOOL_PHY_EDPD_NO_TX` would disable TX when EDPD is enabled
* `ETHTOOL_PHY_EDPD_DISABLE` will disable EDPD

As noted by the `ETHTOOL_PHY_EDPD_DFLT_TX_MSECS` the interval unit is 1
millisecond, which should cover a reasonable range of intervals:
 - from 1 millisecond, which does not sound like much of a power-saver
 - to ~65 seconds which is quite a lot to wait for a link to come up when
   plugging a cable
