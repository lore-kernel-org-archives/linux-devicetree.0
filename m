The only code that can actually be shared between the driver is the two lines 
usb_phy .on_connect callback routine. The init sequence that takes most of the 
digicolor driver is totally different. Using a single driver for both PHYs 
does not make much sense, IMHO.

Besides, phy-mxs-usb.c uses the deprecated usb_phy framework. So we first need 
to port this driver to the generic phy framework.
