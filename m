Correct, but it still maps the entire region out, which means the
consumer needs to know which offset to use. Maxime is saying this
is something that is troublesome to maintain. So my proposal was
to create a regmap with a base at the GMAC register offset. That
way, the consumer doesn't need to use an offset to access it.
