Agreed.  To an extent we are fishing around in the dark at the moment.
Lets wait until we have a few more cases of similar hardware before trying
too much generalization.  This is acting as a good exploration of what
is needed.

Ideally Lars might upstream some of the other bits he has in his tree
to do with DSP processing on ADC streams and that might provide us with
more clues on generality (at least at the lowest layers)
(Apparently he's busy - though he always makes that excuse :)
Joking aside, the exploration Analog and in particular Lars does around
pushing the limits of how things interact is always useful!)
