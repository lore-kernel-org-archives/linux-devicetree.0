The better solution is to never describe the memory to the kernel as
memory, by never placing it in a memory node, and ensuring that if it is
in the UEFI memory map, its attributes do not allow it to be mapped.

That way a driver can map it as non-cacheable if it wishes, but nothing
else can possibly touch that memory.

That is all you need to do.

If GRUB temporarily maps memory as cacheable, or hands it to a device,
then your statements above about cache maintenance are broken.

An EFI application like GRUB might leave something resident in memory
after it's done (consider the UEFI shim), or it could even load the
kernel into the region that you care about having reserved, because as
far as it's concerned it's just memory. That could leave you with a
conflict for that region of memory.

You _must_ care about GRUB (and other EFI applications) doing the right
thing. To get them to avoid a region of memory, it must not be described
as being usable by them in the UEFI memory map.

It definitely is, due to the possibility of stale cache lines being left
in the region from when UEFI may have mapped it with cacheable
attributes.

If EFI touches it there may be stale cache lines left around, which you
don't seem to expect.

Then it is working for you by pure chance alone.

Please listen to the advice you are being given here; we're trying to
ensure that your platform functions (and continues to function) as best
it can.

Thanks,
