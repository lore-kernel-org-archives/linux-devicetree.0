Theoretically, this could be used by other SoC's. However, afaik the
i.MX6 SoloX, which one could see as something like the successor of
Vybrid, implements the interrupt routing differently. So I would be fine
to just use the SOC_VF610 symbol instead.

The only thing which I would rather prefer to keep is the comment what
this is all about (the help text). But I guess I could move that as
comment into the source file...
