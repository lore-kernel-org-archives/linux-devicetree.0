The IP provides two data wires, SD in and SD out. So it can be 
configured either as capture or playback only, or full-duplex.
This corresponds to a mode selection through a register configuration.

This configuration is board dependent. The IP may be used as rx, tx or 
fd depending on board. So I think it can make sense to have a DMA 
configuration linked to board, and to set IP mode accordingly.
