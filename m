Why? There's no point to dma-ranges if the bus is not restricting the
device. dma-ranges is supposed to apply to a bus, not a device. For
example, using dma-ranges for a 32-bit device on a 64-bit platform is
wrong. To put it another way, devices know their addressing
capability, so we don't need to describe that in DT, only external
restrictions outside of the device.

Changing behavior since 4.1 doesn't really seem like a fix. A fix
should generally be tagged for stable and I'd be nervous on this one.

Are we sure all the things a driver may do still work the same? A
driver changing the default 32-bit mask to a 64-bit mask for example.
