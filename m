More than 15 actually. Most .dts files support multiple devices. So
there should be about 30 devices supported by these .dts files.

Synology seem to build there devices like lego. They have two
different RTC blocks. They have three different fan alarm blocks, four
different led blocks, etc. And to build a product, the just select a
group of blocks and put them together.

The board setup code which Ben Peddell wrote has a somewhat similar
structure:

http://klightspeed.killerwolves.net/synology/linux-3.4-synology-0.1.patch

It has a set of functions which add platform devices. And a table
driven piece of code which based on the product name calls these
functions to add the needed platform devices. Take a look at the table
to get a better idea of the re-use factor of the blocks.

In this DT version, i have a dtsi file for each function, and a dti
file for each table entry.

I will add to the changelog in the next version.
