As I have mentioned in the past w.r.t. endianness bindings, there is no
such thing as a "default endianness" or "native endianness".

PowerPC and ARM can be Bi-endian, configured by the kernel.

The hardware's registers have a fixed endianness regardless of this
runtime configuration.

So describe that fixed property, as that does not vary with kernel
configuration (and is therefore a property of the HW rather than the
combination of HW + kernel).

Thanks,
Mark.
