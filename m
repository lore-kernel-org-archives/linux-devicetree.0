It has:

    This was tested by putting a device 100 years in the future (using =
a
    specific kernel due to the inability of userland tools such as date=
 or
    hwclock to pass year 2038), rebooting on a kernel w/ this patch app=

    and verifying the device was still 100 years in the future.

will do that next time.

I can prepare a v0 patch for a "can-wakeup-machine" property to mark th=
e
device as a wakeup source when the IRQ is absent. Will fix the prefix
in a v1.

It disable the alarm. It's not required.

I can add that in the documentation.

Hum, I will take a look at those irq vs wakeup cpabilities when adding
support for "can-wakeup-machine" property to consolidate the behavior.
