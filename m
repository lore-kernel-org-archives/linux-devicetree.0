There are two subsystem for dealing with RNG hw. Hw_random subsystem
for true RNG (driver/char/hw_random) and crypto framework for pseudo
RNG (crypto/ and drviers/crypto). This HW is pseudo RNG so I have
placed the dt bindings in bindings/crypto as the driver itself is in
drivers/crypto folder. I am wondering if there is any relation between
driver folder and bindings folder. Can you please explain the folder
relation? Should this be put in bindings/rng or bindings/crypto?

The driver uses regmap to access the registers. In this case reg
property is not useful. Is reg property still needed? If not, how
should the node be declared?
