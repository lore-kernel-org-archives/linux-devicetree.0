We need to keep those three old ones supported in the driver, but the
newer binding can use dashes instead, as long as the kernel also
handles the old binding.

Again, as mentioned on IRC: We've said that bindings are not yet
stable until we lock them down, so we will need to adjust accordingly.
Once we lock them down, they are stable and part of ABI. But we really
don't want to deal with the bad bindings that people came up with
without much review, and that's what the whole idea behind cleaning up
and then locking them down is all about.

I strongly disagree. The very fact that you don't have the guts to
call it 1.0 or 2.0 means it's nowhere near stable. :) So, let's take
this opportunity to clean up the binding and be done with it. Existing
software that can handle the old binding can do so in the future too,
but new software (and new device trees) should use the newer binding.

Again, don't mix -- switch everyone over. But make the kernel
implementation handle dashes for the three legacy properties.

Again, we can change the binding as long as the kernel and the tools
know what to do with the old bad binding.

Unless you declare one call id value to mean invalid, and use that to
indicate where it's not supported. Seems slightly cleaner but I'm not
going to pick a fight over it. ;-) Either way is fine.
