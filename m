Not quite following but have the following loose idea:

- Add API such as <linux/pinctrl/gpio.h> with struct pin_gpio_ops {}
  or similar. As orthogonal to the mux and config interfaces we already
  have.

- Add ops like .set_input(), .set_output(), .drive_high() and .drive_low()
  (etc) to the ops struct so all functionality currently provided by
  gpiolib can be implemened by a driver.

- Make global pin numbers optional in gpiolib for the next part...

- Register a generic GPIO chip on top of the pinctrl-gpio.c, preferably
  only supporting Alex' descriptors.

- Provide a userspace interface to pinctrl with something like /dev/pinctrlN
  with an ioctl() interface, solving also Roland Stigge's issue with
  driving many pins at the same time in a smooth way.

Sounds like a plan?

I'd like to avoid the either-or-approach where you have to use
pinctrl only or only gpiolib, so a compatibility layer kindof.

I'm prepping a talk at ELC so will try to jot down something more
substantial.
