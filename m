88PM860 device supports dual phase mode on BUCK1 output.
In normal usecase, BUCK1A and BUCK1B operates independently with 3A
capacity. And they both can work as a dual phase providing 6A capacity.

This patch series is subset of earlier patch-series
Link to earlier series - https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/16/722

Except PATCH[5/5], all other patches in the series are accepted and
queued up for next merge window.
And based on discussion on the list, creating DT property to enable
dual-phase mode on BUCK1.

Testing:
 - Tested on 88PM860 based platform
 - Boot tested 
 - Tested with & without DT property being set
 - Read register value before and after probe to make sure that
   value has been set.

V2 => V3:
========
 - Based on discussion on earlier patch-series,
   (comments from Krzysztof Kozlowski)
   Dynamically controlled current capacity and registration of BUCK1B,
   in case of BUCK1 dual phase mode enabled.
   Now, if BUCK1 dual phase is enabled, current capacity is set to 6A,
   and, BUCK1B will not be registered to regulator framework.

V1 => V2:
========
 - This is new patch-series, where, all accepted patches dropped.
   Upgraded Patch version, to ease review.
 - Based on Mark Brown's comment, we should use DT property of its own.
   using set_current_limit() is not right way here.
   So, created DT property for Dual phase mode enable.
 - Updated binding for new DT property
