Remember that I've been "away" from mail for several days last week, as
I had widely published on google+ and on the lists.

Their main purpose is to allow drivers to shut down their peripherals
before the change and bring them back up after the change on SoCs where
the peripherals are clocked off the CPU clock or a derivative of it.

For example, SA11x0 SoCs were never actually designed for CPU frequency
scaling, but we made it work - and in doing so, you have to reprogram a
bunch of peripherals such as PCMCIA timings, LCD controller, and SDRAM
controller - and because of the need to quiesce the SDRAM controller
over the transition, we need to shut down anything which may cause RAM
to be accessed (such as DMA.)

I don't think so - calling the notifiers can be expensive where peripheral
drivers are involved - peripherals may need to wait for the hardware to
quiesce before they can allow the notifier to continue.  You could make
it a different reason code (so that drivers such as the SA11x0 stuff can
ignore these intermediate steps.)

The real answer is not to use the software delay at all when cpufreq is
enabled, and use a timer based delay which is then independent of the
CPU clock rate.

The only case where a software delay is acceptable is as a last resort
fallback if the platform has no other option, or the CPU clock is
stable.
