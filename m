It would probably be best to add an enable-method directory and documen=
t
what each of these mean (what's expected of the platform, what steps an
OS should make to bring up and/or tear down CPUs).

While it's nice to factor this out of the kernel, I'd like this to be
better-defined such that it's clear what the expectations of each
enable-method are. That ways it iss possible for OSs other than Linux t=
o
make use of the enable-method information (as it won't be an opaque
reference to Linux internals), and we can have a clear definition of
each enable-method independent of any implementation details.

Going forward I would like to see fewer implementation-specific
protocols for bringing up secondaries, and a move to fewer more
standardised mechanisms like PSCI. I realise that might not be possible
in all cases, but it would be nice to avoid a proliferation of
enable-methods with single users.

Cheers,
Mark.
