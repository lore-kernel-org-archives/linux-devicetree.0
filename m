Even with the simple-card bindings there are no software specific bits. The 
DAI that is referenced in your example is the physical DAI as it exists in 
the hardware. Which DAI maps to which specifier is defined in the devicetree 
bindings definition for the hardware unit.

Could you describe in detail what a card builder is and how to decide when 
and how a card builder is executed?

Yea, using the graph syntax for the analog pins would result in a lot of 
boiler-plate.

What do you mean by "redefine the CPU and CODEC DAI definitions".

Which widgets/routes do you mean?

I'd agree if this was some kind of kernel internal stuff, but this is 
creating ABI and we have to maintain it forever. Rushing this in without 
proper discussion and consideration of the more complex use-cases is in my 
opinion not a good idea.
