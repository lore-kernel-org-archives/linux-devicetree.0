I'd agree 100% if the test could give false failures.  But in this
case it can only give false passes.  If the test fails there is a bug
*somewhere*, even if it's not actually in whatever changed last.  The
test framework actually has a "PASS (inconclusive)" result for exactly
this sort of case.

Aside: it's supposed to;  if it doesn't, that's a bug.  You can try it
easily enough with "make checkm".

Hrm.  I don't want to run the whole testsuite under valgrind by
default for a couple of reasons.  First, it's much, much slower, and
second you need to have valgrind installed.  Both these would
discourage people from running the testsuite so frequently, and even
without valgrind it's very, very useful.

I guess we could make the new one a "valgrind only" test, that's we
only bother to execute when the valgrind options are enabled.

Hrm.  A malloc() with a "known buggy" allocation pattern would be
impractical, I agree.  But it occurred to me that a much simpler
malloc() wrapper which filled each allocated block with garbage
(non-zero) data before returning it would be sufficient in this case.
