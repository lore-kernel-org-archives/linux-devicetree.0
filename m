Sorry, no. I meant that con_id is typically something like "core"
or "ahb" or something like that, and dev_id is something like
"a456002.pmic_device" or whatever dev_name(pmic_dev) would return for
the consuming device. That way when we call clk_get(dev, "core")
it will find the lookup with "core" and "a456002.pmic_device" to
match up the clk lookup.

If anything, the clk_name should just go into the con_id for now,
and then it will need to be a globally unique identifier for the
clk. But that is going against how clkdev is supposed to be used.
Hence the question if you even need to use it. If not, just don't
add it. I can fix up v3 of this patch to put clk_name back at
con_id if you like. No need to resend.
