Could you maybe add some documentation about this implicit information
shared between a bootloader and this driver?
I understand why you do this, but there must be a better way than
depending on something some bootloader wrote in some undocumented
register, no?
The documentation just says:

"These registers are used to store handoff infomation between the
preloader and the OS. These 8 registers can be used to store any
information. The contents of these registers have no impact on the
state of the HPS hardware"

If it is already agreed upon, that a bridge-enable property is okay,
why not add a port-enable property, too?
