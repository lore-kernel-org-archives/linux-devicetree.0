While at it, I was thinking about the problem we are trying to solve in
another way. If ftrace itself can use pages from the persistent ram store,
instead of the kernel's buddy allocator, then the ftrace ring buffer itself
could persist across a system reboot.

The clear advantage of that for Sai's pstore events work is, not having to
duplicate a lot of the ring buffer code and stuff into pstore (for the pstore
events for example, I wanted time stamps as well and ftrace's ring buffer has
some nice time management code to deal with time deltas). We already have
other ring buffers maintained in other parts of the kernel for tracing right?
So I'm a bit averse to duplicating that into pstore as well for tracing. The
other advantage of persisting the ftrace ring buffer would also mean data
from other tracers such as function-graph tracer and irqsoff tracers would
also persist and then we can also probably get rid of ftrace-in-pstore stuff
which is kind of incomplete anyway since it does not have time stamps for
recorded functions.

Steven and Kees: what do you think, is persisting ftrace ring buffer across
reboots a worthwhile idea? Any thoughts on how feasible something like that
could be, code wise? Off the top, I think the ring buffer state that ftrace
needs other than the trace data itself will also have to be persisted.

thanks,
