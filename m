this is my fault. I added the Kconfig comment only after you looked at
the patches. Same for the change in reset_control_get below, which is
change enough to argue I should have dropped the Reviewed-by.

For devices that change their power domain related state during a reset,
some kind of integration could be needed.

Even so, isn't it useful to avoid the -EPROBE_DEFERRED loop when we
expect other drivers to depend on resources provided by the reset
controller drivers, but not the other way around?

Will fix.

I wanted to keep it simple in the first round, but I agree. It might be
helpful to add it from the beginning.

Ok.
