I realize this is a bit confusing. I think that part of this comes from
the fact that OSCIN is not used consistently in the TRMs. It is used as
the name of the actual pin on the SoC for connecting an external clock
signal or crystal. It is also used as an input to CLKMODE where it means
the output of the internal oscillator rather than the external pin (some
SoCs show CLKMODE as a mux with OSCIN and CLKIN, but I agree that it is
not really a mux since OSCIN and CLKIN are the same external pin on the
SoC - then other SoCs show OSCIN meaning only the external pin here).
Furthermore, OSCIN is listed as one of the inputs of EXTCLKSRC also as
one of the inputs of OBSCLK on da850-type SoCs.

So, the option I went with here is that "ref_clk" is the external clock
connected to the OSCIN pin and that the "oscin" clock is the clock domain
_after_ CLKMODE. This matches the use of OSCIN in the TRMs where "OSCIN"
is used as an input for EXTCLKSRC and OBSCLK. Also the fact that the
external reference clock is sometimes called CLKSRC instead of OSCIN
influenced the decision go with "oscin" being the internal (to the PLL)
clock domain.

I think what I should have done, though, is named PLL_HAS_OSCIN as
PLL_HAS_CLKMODE instead. I think what you are missing here is that
PLL_HAS_OSCIN (or PLL_HAS_CLKMODE) only means that the PLL _has_
PLLCTL[CLKMODE]. It does _not_ mean that we set (or clear) PLLCTL[CLKMODE].
On SoCs with two PLLs, only one of them has the PLLCTL[CLKMODE] bit (and
therefore the PLL_HAS_OSCIN flag) and the output of this is shared by both
PLLs, e.g. Figure 7-1. PLLC Structure in the AM1808 TRM (spruh82c). So,
the clock tree in Linux ends up looking like this:

ref_clk - the external clock - aka CLKSRC
+-oscin - internal clock domain after CLKMODE - shared by both PLLs
   +-pll0_extclksrc
   +-pll0_prediv
   +-pll0_auxclk
   +-pll0_obsclk - via the OSCSRC mux
   +-pll1_pllen
   +-pll1_pllout
   +-pll1_obsclk - via the OSCSRC mux

Clocks beyond two levels deep are omitted for brevity.

It should be easy to see the correlation here Figure 7-1 with the
exception that in Figure 7-1 "OSCIN" has the meaning of "the physical
pin on the chip" (which Linux calls "ref_clk") and there is no clear
label in Figure 7-1 of what the clock domain after PLLCTL[CLKMODE] is
called (which Linux calls "oscin").

Sure, it would work just fine if we left "oscin" out of the picture,
but it simplifies the driver implementation by having a known "oscin"
clock that is fully controlled by the clock driver code instead of
having to pass the user-supplied "ref_clk" around a bunch of places.
And, we could try to call it something other than "oscin" to try
to avoid confusion, but then you will just cause confusion in other
places (which could be less total confusion, so I am open to change
here).

Switching topics to CLKMODE and DT...

There is a "ti,clkmode-square-wave" property in the proposed DT bindings
that does exactly what you have suggested, except the logic is
reversed. When omitted, it assumes the use of a crystal oscillator.
I believe this is the most common configuration, which is why I made
it the default instead of the other way around.
