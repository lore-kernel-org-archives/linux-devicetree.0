Okay, point taken.  You can keep the node name as it is.

For existing bindings, I do not care that much.  But for new ones, I do
hope that we recommend to use hyphen, as that's more idiomatic at least
for Linux kernel.

Both are valid, but hyphen is more idiomatic for Linux kernel.

This is something I see difference between specification and DTC.

	aliases {
		alias-name = &label_name;
	};

	label_name: node-name {
		...
	};

The spec says that only hyphen is valid for alias name, but DTC works
happily with underscore too.  From my experience with DTC playing, both
hyphen and underscore are valid for alias and node name.  But for label
name, only underscore is valid.  Using hyphen in label name will cause
DTC to report syntax error.
