I'm looking at it now. There are problems with emac & mdio both in
legacy and in DT mode.

The davinci_mdio driver seems to not get an actual functional clock
(phy is reported as down). I'm seeing that in old legacy code,
mdio_clk has emac_clk as parent, while after your changes they share
pll0_sysclk4 as parent, although I'm not sure if that has anything to
do with it.

I'll see about the rmii clock too.

Thanks,
Bartosz
