Fixed.

How about this instead:

All port nodes are located under the device's "_DSD" node in the
hierarchical data extension tree. The property extension related to
each port node must contain the key "port" and an integer value which
is the number of the port.

I agree. I'm definitely for using human readable strings instead of
indices here. I'll change the implementation correspondingly.
