I am afraid I have no USB 3.0 PC running Linux.

Ok, so the maximum physical port number is 6 as well as bNbrports value.
The "reg" value at dts should be from 1 to 6. "reg" stands for physical
port number for individual physical port, eg if "reg" equals to 1, it
stands for the device connects at port 1, no matter the device is HS or
SS, it can use the node whose "reg" is 1.
