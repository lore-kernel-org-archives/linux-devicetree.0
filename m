Whether that is safe depends on what you are trying to ensure is
ordered, and what the other side (with the WFE) is doing.

For example, my understanding is that in general, WFE is also not
ordered w.r.t.  memory accesses.

This is a very subtle part of the architecture, and I'm very much not
keen on using WFE and SEV outside of architecture code implementing
locking primitives.

Thanks,
Mark.
