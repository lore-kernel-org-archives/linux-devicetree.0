AFAIK, we don't have a specific workaround required anywhere that these
strings would help with. It's just that generic GIC strings had been
brought up repeatedly with no particular conclusion.

If we simply ensure that new DTS that feature a GIC have
implementation-specific strings in addition to those we already support
(e.g. "arm,cortex-a9-gic"), then I'm fine with that.

Arguably neither are "true" GICv2, but your point stands.
