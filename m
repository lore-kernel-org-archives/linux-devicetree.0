If it is like the earlier chips you will also have the choice of
something based at 0, there is a register bit that sets the reset
address.

Having the kernel enforce that the DT node is present and at the right
location, I think, is helpful for the bootloader folks to ensure they
write correct DTs.

The function was called armada_xp_smp_prepare_cpus - all Armada XP's
will work like this..
