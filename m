I don't know. Like I said, unknown magic. I haven't found the source code to
the U-Boot version that the board uses.

For all I know, it could be a bug in the Linux USB stack. I've always had
to unplug and replug my USB keyboards after Linux has booted, otherwise
they are not detected. If the keyboard was connected to a hub, Linux doesn't
detect that port on the hub, so the hub must be unplugged and replugged.
If it's an internal hub, tough luck.

The GPIO flag is overridden by the regulator core, which makes it misleading.
I will remove the GPIO flag and add a comment there that GPIO flags are not
supported. This is to prevent someone from thinking that

gpio = <... GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
enable-active-high;

and

gpio = <... GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

are equivalent. It would be an easy mistake to make, because in mmc nodes,

cd-gpios = <...  GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

and

cd-gpios = <...  GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
cd-inverted;

_are_ equivalent.

Take it up with the maintainer of the regulator core, then. :)

Fair enough, I'll add an include file the next time around. Like you
mentioned youself, though, we will only really know how compatible the two
PMICs are when we have the code to support the other features (or a data
sheet/user's manual is found). I'm hopeful based on what has been found so
far.
