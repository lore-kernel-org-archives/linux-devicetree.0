Maybe I'm not understanding correctly. I think that if there is an
appended dtb, then there are sections like the code and data that needs
to be adjusted by the old r0 value, while the bss and the stack need to
be adjusted by the old r0 + dtb size.

If my understanding is right, then we can't just add the dtb size to r0
and adjust everything.

Am I missing something?
