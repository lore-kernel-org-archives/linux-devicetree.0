Certain clocks should not be turned of by clk_disable_unused.  Until
now we have been using the kernel command-line of the same name to
prevent common clk from turning off all clocks without a reference,
as this would ensure hardware lockup.  This patch lists each
platform interconnect which needs to stay on to prevent the
aforementioned issue from arising.
