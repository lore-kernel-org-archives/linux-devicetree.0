What does the "CPU index" correspond to physically on the CPU?

Can h8300 support SMP?

Is this strictly necessary?

What's this needed for?

Surely you need two cells to encode index and flags?

Nit: call this "interrupt-controller" rather than "ntc".

Without a reg you shouldn't have a unit-address (the '@0' part).

How does the CPU communicate with this controller? I assume it's not
MMIO.

These comments also apply to "renesas,h8s-intc".

It would be great if you could use stdout-path from the start rather
than passing console= in bootargs. That makes things far less fragile
w.r.t. physical vs logical naming, and keeps console and earlycon in
sync.

It also means that a user can replace bootargs and still expect the
console to work by default (unless overridden explicitly).

Please get rid of the clocks container node and place the clocks
directly under the root node. There's nothing magic about a /clocks
node, and it's not been listed as a bus of any sort.

Are there existing bindings for these? I didn't see any as part of the
portion of the series I was Cc'd for.

Nit: the unit-address should math the address in the reg entry (here it
should be 400000 rather than 0).

If you implement earlycon you'd only need a single stdout-path entry
here, which would make this much nicer.

Thanks,
Mark.
