I'm not sure to understand you concern here.

Describing sub nodes, especially for big SoC is pretty useful.
It is as useful as doing that for board that are sharing similar components.
It will allow to define several Audio / PMIC variants without having to 
rewrite a driver potentially.

DT is about HW description. You can go to whatever level you'd like as 
soon as it is relevant for the drivers.

In this is case it is relevant since the sub-devices will have driver to 
be bound to the device nodes.

Both Vibra and Codec IPs can be located elsewhere, so by exposing that 
inside the DT, you will increase the level of HW details and thus make 
the re-use of these sub-IPs easier.

The twl6040 is just a container. These IPs can be inside a PCI chip, or 
inside OMAP or whatever, but they do need a node to represent them. In 
this case the container is irrelevant, only the children matter.

Moreover, the fact the Linux implementation uses MFD to represent that 
is irrelevant for the DT description. We should be able to use whatever 
SW representation for this type of HW.

DT was useful to get rid of static board definition. DT can be useful as 
well to get rid of the static cell definition inside a MFD.
This is exactly the same problem at different HW level.

Benoit
