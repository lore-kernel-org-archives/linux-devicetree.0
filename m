I'm definitely fine with tossing in everything that is PXA specific,
even if it's rarely used.

If someone wants a smaller kernel, they can still start out with the
defconfig and disable stuff they don't need, which tends to be easier
than the opposite, and it gives us compile-time coverage with the
autobuilders that compile every defconfig.
