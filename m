No worries, I believe that 1 week is actually a pretty good

This is quite use-case specific, anyways, the probing is a 2 step process:

1) Identify which hardware there is in the tablet, this is pretty
reliable, we only detect a fix set of known possible touchscreens
and accelerometers, at known addresses and almost all have an id
register to check.

2) Determine *defaults* for various none probable settings, like guessing
which firmware to load into the touchscreen controllers, as there are
at least 2 ways the gsl1680 is wired up on these tablets and this
requires 2 different firmware files. This uses heuristics, to, as said,
determine the defaults all of the non-probable bits are overidable
through config options (currently kernel module options). Getting these
wrong is not dangerous to the hardware, but will work in a non-functional
or misbehaving (wrong coordinates) touchscreen.

Note with the models I've access to so far the heuristics score 100%
but I'm not sure how representative the 16 models I've access to are
(they are all different and have been bought over a span of multiple
years).

I understand your worries, as said I'm confident the actual probing
is safe and getting the heuristics wrong will result in misbehavior,
but not in any hardware damage or such.

I assume you mean an arbitrary q8 tablet here, as the probe code does
bind by board/machine compatible, so for a really arbitrary board
this code will never activate.

I understand your worry, but moving the probing code to say u-boot
will not change any of this, the kernel will get the explicit
description created by the u-boot probe code, but it would be
just as wrong.

So maybe we need to answer 2 questions in a row:

1) Do we want such probe code at all ?

My answer to this is yes, these (cheap) tablets are interesting to
e.g. the maker community and I would like them to run mainline
(and run mainline well), but given the way there are put together
this require some code to dynamically adapt to the batch of the
month somewhere

2) Where do we put this code ?

If we agree on 1 (I assume we do) then this becomes the real
question, at which point your worries about the kernel assuming
something which is not true because the probe code got it wrong
may become true regardless where the code lives.

So wrt this worries is all I can do is ask you to trust me to
not mess things up, just like we all trust driver authors, etc.
all the time to not mess things up.

Right, so again I think we need to split the discussion in 2 steps:

1) How do we apply the fixups, currently I'm using free-form changes
done from C-code. I can envision moving to something like the quirk
mechanism suggested by Pantelis in the past. Note this is not a perfect
fit for my rather corner-case use-case, but I can understand that in
general you want the variants to be described in dt, and activated
in some way, rather then have c-code make free-form changes to the dt

2) How do we select which fixups to apply. Again I can understand
you wanting some well defined mechanism for this, but again my
use-case is special and simply does not allow for this as there
is no id-eeprom to read or some such.

Because for normal end users meddling with the bootloader / with u-boot's
environment is like flashing a PC BIOS. Most (non technical) end users will
want to install u-boot once (or not at all) and then just have it work.

More difficult means not doable for many users.

It is an argument to put much of the dynamic (dt) hardware support in
the kernel in general.

Nothing really specific (I've not yet tried porting the probe code
to u-boot), but I just find working within the kernel easier in general,
since there really just is a lot more infrastructure. Note I'm the
upstream u-boot maintainer for the allwinner SoC support, so this
is not due to me being unfamiliar with u-boot.

Yes there are other solutions, but they all involve a lot more
moving pieces (and thus will break) then a single isolated .c file
in the kernel, which is all this series adds.

Esp the intermediate solution just adds a ton of complexity with 0
gain.

And as I tried to explain before, for this specific use-case describing
all this board specific knowledge in a generic manner in dt is simply
impossible, unless we add a turing complete language to dt aka aml.

I've a feeling that you're mixing this, rather special, use-case with
the more generic use-case of daughter-boards for various small-board-computers
I agree that for the SBC use-case it makes sense to try and come up with
a shared core / dt bindings for much of this. Note that even this boards
will still need a board (or board-family) specific method for getting
the actual id from a daughter-board, but this board specific code could
then pass the id to some more general hw-manager core which starts applying
dt changes based on the id. But this assumes there is a single id to
uniquely identify the extensions, which in my case there simply is not.

The only answer I've to: "with match criteria and fixups explicit in the DTB"
is: ok, give my a turing complete language inside DTB then, anything else
will not suffice. So either we are doomed to reinvent ACPI; or we must
accept some board(family) specific C-code in the kernel.
