How is this different from status/secure-status?
I have no other needs for the moment. I'm experimenting with the
introduction of DT in OP-TEE. The secure-status property (or lack
thereof) already allows me to know if a device can be used by the secure
OS and how it should be mapped (secure vs. non-secure). This extension
allows me to reuse the same TEE binary and change the console, which is
a simple use case to demonstrate the advantage of using the DT in the
secure FW.

The problem I see with removing entries is that the secure firmware may
have multiple stages (say, ARM Trusted Firmware plus a secure OS such as
OP-TEE).
