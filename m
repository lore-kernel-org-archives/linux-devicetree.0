3rd parties could choose to write a driver (as opposed to use say, a user-mode
library) if it fits their programming model better, if they think they would
have better performance, or other reasons.

The main idea is to make DT the authoritative source of HW description.

That may be true, but so far we are not discussing changing DT's API so it
should not have big ramifications.
Besides, what "makes sense now" may "not make sense tomorrow" depending on
how the HW is modified.
We have somehow learned the hard-way that "le mieux est l'ennemi du bien"
(the better is the enemy of the good) and we are trying to take a more
practical (and flexible) approach.

That does not seem very positive and it is not the case anyway, otherwise we
would not be consulting here :-)
Agreed, right now this whole thing seems like a really hypothetical question,
but the intention is good.

Actually, I think it would encourage more SoC manufacturers to use DT as a way
to document their HW, which is a good thing.

I don't have a more concrete example now.

As I stated, right now HW description is not centralised, and thus different
bits of information are cherry-picked by hand from HW description into DT for
bootloader, DT for Linux, Documentation/headers for 3rd-parties, etc.

But if I understood correctly your comment, you are basically saying that
without an example is hard to say.
Since the question seems understood, do you have an example of other SoC's
doing something similar?

I've seen some big DT descriptions, but it is difficult to know if we are the
first ones trying to use the DT in this way.

Best regards,

Sebastian
