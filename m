Right.  The real issue is the state of these properties within the
binding documentation.  Linux isn't the only consumer of these dts
files (*BSD, barebox, etc), so us not using them doesn't necessarily
mean the property should be removed.

The most important lesson (recently learned ;-) ) is to make sure all
properties are accurately describing the *hardware*.  Not Linux's
implementation of talking to the hardware.  That'll go a long way if the
changelog discusses how property X is an implementation detail vice a
hardware characteristic or feature.

True.  In Silvio's defense, I just told him to Cc us to get the ball
rolling.  (I tend to dislike long discussions on chat mediums, I'd much
rather they be in email.  So I was definitely too succinct).

For the record, you can use ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl on your patches
to make sure you get most of the right people.  In this case, that'll
include the DT maintainers.  You may want to run a get_maintainer.pl -f
arch/arm/mach-$ARCH for each of the dts file you touch.  Those
maintainers usually wrangle the patches for their dts files.
Unfortunately, not all of them have updated MAINTAINERS
(<cough>mvebu<cough>) to include the dts file patterns.

thx,

Jason.
