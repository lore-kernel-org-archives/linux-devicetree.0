Subject: [Resend: PATCH v2 1/4] Documentation: dt: soc: move driver description to a separate document
Date: Mon, 12 Oct 2015 15:54:59 -0400
Message-ID: <1444679700-11451-1-git-send-email-m-karicheri2@ti.com>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
Return-path: <linux-doc-owner@vger.kernel.org>
Sender: linux-doc-owner@vger.kernel.org
To: corbet@lwn.net, ssantosh@kernel.org, linux-doc@vger.kernel.org, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org, linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org, robh+dt@kernel.org, pawel.moll@arm.com, mark.rutland@arm.com, ijc+devicetree@hellion.org.uk, galak@codeaurora.org, linux@arm.linux.org.uk, devicetree@vger.kernel.org, arnd@arndb.de
List-Id: devicetree@vger.kernel.org

Currently the DT bindings have details about the driver as well. This
patch moves this to a separate document for knav qmss driver so that
driver detail update can be done as needed without polluting the DT
bindings description.

+
+The QMSS (Queue Manager Sub System) found on Keystone SOCs is one of
+the main hardware sub system which forms the backbone of the Keystone
+multi-core Navigator. QMSS consist of queue managers, packed-data structure
+processors(PDSP), linking RAM, descriptor pools and infrastructure
+Packet DMA.
+The Queue Manager is a hardware module that is responsible for accelerating
+management of the packet queues. Packets are queued/de-queued by writing or
+reading descriptor address to a particular memory mapped location. The PDSPs
+perform QMSS related functions like accumulation, QoS, or event management.
+Linking RAM registers are used to link the descriptors which are stored in
+descriptor RAM. Descriptor RAM is configurable as internal or external memory.
+The QMSS driver manages the PDSP setups, linking RAM regions,
+queue pool management (allocation, push, pop and notify) and descriptor
+pool management.
+
+knav qmss driver provides a set of APIs to drivers to open/close qmss queues,
+allocate descriptor pools, map the descriptors, push/pop to queues etc. For
+details of the available APIs, please refers to include/linux/soc/ti/knav_qmss.h
