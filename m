Hurray, world domination is one step closer ;-)

Might want to write this as 0x08000000 (easier to read).

Any node with a textual unit address (@0) needs to have a "reg" property
with the same address (and then the parent node, "cpus", should have
#address-cells and #size-cells defined, probably to 1 and 0 resp. in  
this
case).

You can just name the node "cpu" here.

Same thing here.  Although, does your interrupt controller have any  
registers?
You should describe them then.

Opencores has and always will have only one UART implementation?  You  
should
make the "compatible" name more specific ("opencores,uart-16550a"  
perhaps).

Probably shouldn't have the "ethoc" there, way too generic a name.

> +			reg = <0x92000000 0x53>;

0x53?  Usually you write the size of the register block that is decoded,
not just the size of the defined registers; so it would be 0x100 or  
something
like that.
