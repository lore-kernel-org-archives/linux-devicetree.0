So we have two competing series, all based on the same stuff. I must say
this is rather disappointing that people can't manage to collaborate and
work towards a common goal.

I'm going to review the irqchip part, because I've done that on Heiner's
series as well, but that's where I'm going to stop.

Heiner, Jerome: please sort this out between yourselves *BEFORE* sending
any other patch series. This is wasting everybody's time, both yours and
mine (and frankly, this a rather rare commodity these days).

Thanks,

	M.
