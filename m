It adds a lot of boilerplate to the DT to split it up into nodes and
mapping index to a bank isn't onerous.  I think I like the single node
with #gpio-cells = <3> better.  When DTC handles named constants then
it will be even easier.

Just need to decide on the best way to implement it.  Arnd, can you
review Roland's v9 patches for me and give me your opinion?
