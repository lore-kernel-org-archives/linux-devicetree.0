What's you says here is true.
and we try to guarantee that only one of NAND or eMMC is enabled, so no
race condition, as a example of the use cases:

1) for enabling NAND driver, we do
   a) enable both mmc-clkc, and NAND driver in DT, they can access
register by using regmap interface
   b) disable eMMC DT node

2) for enabling eMMC driver, we do
   a) enable eMMC node, access register by using iomap (for now)
   b) disable both mmc-clkc and NAND in DT

IMO, I'd leave this out of this series, since this patch series is quite
complete as itself. Although, the downside is code duplication.

Still, I need to hear Jerome, or Kevin's option, to see if or how we
should proceed the eMMC's clock conversion.

I could think of three option myself
1) don't do the conversion, downside is code duplication, upside is NO
DT change, no compatibility issue
2) add a syscon node into eMMC DT node, then only convert clock part
into this mmc-clkc model, while still leave other eMMC register access
as the usual iomap way (still no race condition)
3) convert all eMMC register access by using regmap interface.

both 2) and 3) need to update the DT.

and probably 2) is a compromise way, and 1) is also OK, 3) is probably
the worst way due to dramatically change (I think this was already
rejected in the previous discussion)
