There are couple of changes required in patch 4/6 of this series. I
will do that and resubmit.

Since these patches are based on Boojin's pl330 driver update patches,
it would be easier to take the same route which Boojin's patches will
take. I will try to get acks' for the patches that you have listed.

Thanks for your help.

Thomas.
