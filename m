I can make sure the names are consistent for some of them but most of it 
would be messy to combine into a single doc IMO. I know it looks similar 
for some of them like the algorithm nodes but they are very different in 
parameters and operation.

Would it suffice to just make sure the properties that are the same be 
reflected across both docs?

Thanks
