the same time?

Please keep in mind that the DT is supposed to be tied to the hardware,
*not* the kernel.  iow, a dtb comes with a board, and the user/OS
upgrades the kernel as needed w/o upgrading or changing the dtb.

So the question you need to ask yourself is: Are there any users (since
v3.5) that are doing this?  If so, they have "mrvl,..." compatible
strings in their dtbs.  You don't want to break their systems on kernel
upgrade, right?

So you can change the binding to say the correct string is
"marvell,...", but that driver X must have an extra compatible entry fo=
r
"mrvl,..." so as not to break dtbs generated from v3.5 to v3.10.

You might even be able to get away with just adding a comment beside th=
e
"mrvl,..." string in the driver.

Does that make sense?

thx,

Jason.
