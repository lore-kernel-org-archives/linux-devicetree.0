And we all have a choice whether we let the marketing people's
insanity spread into our engineering projects, or if we keep it as
sane as possible in spite of them.

I wouldn't have an objection here if there was some sort of rationale
between what "apq" and "msm" means. But it seems like qualcomm rolls a
dice and decides if a platform will have one name or the other.
Dragonboard dmesg says msm<foo>. DTS file for the same board says apq.
DTSI file says one thing, overridden by the dts to something else.
Total chaos.

I would be fine with adding two instead of one (after all, platforms
like TI has this for AM* vs OMAP*, etc), but there _has_ to be some
sort of consistency or you might just as well assign a random string
as name.

So, if you can't come up with a reasonable, rational and consistent
naming scheme (which, apparantly, you can't since your marketing guys
are in control of this and they don't get it right), then at least
prefix with a common string for the platform. That's all I'm asking.
