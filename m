I think this boils down to if they really are compatible or not. If
for instance a 16550 port would be compatible with 8250 on a hardware
level then using them in the order of "16550", "8250" makes sense. In
this case the r8a7791 i2c is not really strictly based on r8a7790 i2c,
it is just that r8a7790 has support in the driver. So it's a short cut
instead of actual hardware compatibility.

So far we've dealt with this by updating the driver and only relying
on the actual SoC name as suffix.

I'm sure there are tons of opinions. =)

Cheers,
