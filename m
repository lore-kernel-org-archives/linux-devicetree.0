Are you OK to break ABI later? Or at a minimum, deprecate the current
binding (maintain it forever for legacy platforms) and create a new
clock controller binding description that supersedes the legacy binding
for all new platforms?

If the answer to either question is "yes", then I'm OK to put it aside
for now. But if the answer to both is "no", and this patch series is
breaking ABI, then we really should fix it now.

Mike
