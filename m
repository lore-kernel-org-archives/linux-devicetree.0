SLIMbus (Serial Low Power Interchip Media Bus) is a specification
developed by MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) alliance.
SLIMbus is a 2-wire implementation, which is used to communicate with
peripheral components like audio-codec.
SLIMbus uses Time-Division-Multiplexing to accommodate multiple data
channels, and control channel. Control channel has messages to do
device-enumeration, messages to send/receive control-data to/from
SLIMbus devices, messages for port/channel management, and messages to
do bandwidth allocation.
Framework is introduced to support  multiple instances of the bus
(1 controller per bus), and multiple slave devices per controller.
SPI and I2C frameworks, and comments from last time when I submitted
the patches were referred-to while working on this framework.

These patchsets introduce device-management, OF helpers, and messaging
APIs, controller driver for Qualcomm's SLIMbus controller, and
clock-pause feature for entering/exiting low-power mode for SLIMbus.
Framework patches to do channel, port and bandwidth
management are work-in-progress and will be sent out once these
initial patches are accepted.

These patchsets were tested on IFC6410 board with Qualcomm APQ8064
processor using the controller driver, and a WCD9310 codec.
