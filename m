Thanks a lot for quick reviewing :)

Sure, I will add a documentation for this.

The reason for not using bool flag is: usually SoC may have many idle
states, so if user wants to partially enable some states then can set
the latency to constraint.

But of course, we can change this to binary value as you suggested,
this means turn on of turn off all states. The only one reason to use
latency value is it is more friendly for hardware design, e.g. some
platforms can enable partial states to save power and avoid overheat
after using this driver.

If you guys think this is a bit over design, I will follow up your
suggestion. I also have some replying in Mathieu's reviewing, please
help review as well.

I have checked ARM ARMv8, but there have no detailed description for
this. I refered coresight-etmv4 code and Mike's pseudo code, ther have
no debug_os_lock() related operations.

Mike, Mathieu, could you also help confirm this?

No. PCSROffset is defined differently in ARMv7 and ARMv8; So finally we
simplize PCSROffset value :
0000 - Sample offset applies based on the instruction state (indicated by PCSR[0])
0001 - No offset applies.
0010 - No offset applies, but do not use in AArch32 mode!

So we need handle the corner case is when CPU runs AArch32 mode and
PCSRoffset = 'b0010. Other cases the pcsr should be present.

[...]

Other suggestions are good for me, will take them in next version.

Thanks,
Leo Yan
