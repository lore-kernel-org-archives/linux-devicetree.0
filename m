Hello,

finally I managed to test this series on my (unmodified) rn104.

For patch 1: Maybe point out that the issue with the century bit isn't
that critical, because this bit is not expected to be set before year 2100.

For patch 3: This patch adds a few dev_err calls that get later amended
in patch 5 to also include an error code. IMHO these should already be
added in patch 3. Patch 5 should only add it to the already existing
strings (if applicable).

For patch 4: Maybe
s/obsolete/for backwards compatibility, don't use in new code/.

Some further comments inline ...

This is not pretty, but I don't know if there is a nicer alternative.
Maybe this should only be done in the presence of a flag in the device
tree (say: can-wakeup-machine, a prefix would be nice, but "isil," feels
wrong).

Why is this needed?

Maybe point out in the commit log that the first alarm (of two) is used,
and the event is signaled on pin $Ididntlookitup.
(IIRC the 2nd alarm register set doesn't support seconds, but in return
has year and month field.)

Maybe add the machines you know of that have this setup to the comment.

I didn't check, but I wonder it that could be/is done by the device
core already?

Does this need a check for data->irq?

ditto.

Thanks for your efforts to improve my NAS :-)
