Let me just answer the questions about the regulator names and get back to
you about your other points.

Sys_config.fex lists is as supplying the audio codec as well, so
"vddio-wifi-codec" perhaps?

I think nothing else is connected to pin group A, so I'll call it
"vddio-gmac".

The SoC data sheet uses the names "VDD18-DLL" and "VCC18-PLL". However, it's
quite likely that more of the SoC's 1.8 V consumers are connected to bldo1,
as I see no other likely 1.8 V supply for them. I'll call it "vdd18".

The LEDs are controlled by PG10 and PG11 but get their power from cldo1,
which is connected to the (common) anode of the red and blue LED. Cldo1 also
supplies the SoCs "VCC-PL", which powers pin group L that controls the USB
2.0 Vbus and vdd-cpub regulators. Pin group L has nothing to do with the
LEDs. Thus I think the regulator name is appropriate in this case.
