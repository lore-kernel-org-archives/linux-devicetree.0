For HDMI, the port number should dictate which one is video and which is audio.

Uhh, no. Not at all what I had in mind.

I think your problems start with trying to extend simple-card. This
binding is anything but simple. I think using OF graph is a good idea,
but trying to make it completely generic is not.

These look like properties of the ak4613 to me, so put them in the
ak4613 node. If they are standard property names, then you just walk
the graph and get them.

Not really sure how you are using these to comment.

If you are trying to describe a connection between hdmi_snd0 and ssi2,
then do just that. Add a port to ssi2 and connect it to hdmi_snd0.
