Not that I know of. No driver uses DMA memcpy

I think this is much more reasonable.

Yeah, and thats why I think its better to add it as and when there is a
real need for it. At least at that point we are sure of the usecase.

I guess the only advantage is that they will not clash with peripheral
mode usage. But even then, some sort of reservation is needed. So I
guess QDMA is no better than the EDMA reserved channels?

For now, I think its better to not add any reservation. It can be added
when its really needed.
