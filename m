Yes - the problem with maintaining lots of boards is having to copy and 
paste duplicated lines per nodes in many files which can be maintained 
with a single define.

SATA is not the only place we use defines.  This is one change for 
review to see if there are any "real" problems with doing it upstream 
and get comment.  All the board variations simply add a few defines and 
don't need to do anything else using my approach.  No out-of-tree 
special tools or scripts required to generate dts files, no run-time 
bootloader or kernel changes necessary.

Sure, if it is a single line change needed through a "chosen" or 
"directive" instead of a "define" that sounds fine.  How would I do that 
in the SATA example?
I am looking for an in-tree solution to managing the boards in a simpler 
manner than what is available by cutting and pasting nodes in many files.
The use of the defines allows such without any special script or tool or 
repo needing to be maintained out of tree.
