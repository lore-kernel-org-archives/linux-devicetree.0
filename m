The problem for us is that clk maintainers don't want new drivers to use
CLK_OF_DECLARE and instead use platform devices. I have just written such
a new driver that is shared by 6 different SoCs. For some combinations of
SoCs and clocks, using a platform device is fine but on others we need to
register early, so the drivers now have to handle both cases, which is
kind of messy and fragile. If there is a generic way to register platform
devices early, then the code is simplified because we only have to handle
one method of registering the clocks instead of two.
