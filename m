I'm not sure I understand what you are talking about.  As I've already
said at least once having a *machine* driver which covers multiple
machines is absolutely OK.  We already have several such drivers in
kernel.

*Please* look at the existing code and read what I'm saying, and ideally
also read the prior discussions on this topic.  Please also try to avoid
inventing your own techncial terms.  It's enormously repetitive and not
terribly useful to have to go through all this stuff from square one
every single time someone looks at this stuff.

More a problem of deciding which of the many available options to
choose.
