I agree, will fix this and such use of ternary operators in the code.

I did not like it either, will remove them as this might be redundant. 
"MCLK" is already a supply widget.

Will move to switch and any such occurrences.

It makes sense to have a single default map here, I will do the in next 
version. And regarding user controllable, I will go thru the list once 
again in detail and remove user controllable registers.

I will not be using MFD in this instance as most of the resources like 
interrupts, pins, clks, SoundWire are modeled as proper drivers with 
their respective subsystems.

This gives a advantage of reusing those drivers like SoundWire, pinctrl 
on other Qualcomm IPs as well!
Also I did not wanted to have a custom functions or hooks in the 
drivers, so platform bus made much sense for me to use here, which can 
take care of bringing up and tearing down the devices with proper parent 
child relationship.
This will instantiate all the child devices like pinctrl, SoundWire 
Controller and so on.

Yes, I will fix such instances in the driver in next version.

I will fix this in next version with single place to print the version 
number.
