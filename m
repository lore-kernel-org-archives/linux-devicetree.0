I think that you did not look at my code.

Both S/PDIF and I2S work with the TDA998x. It is a choice of the audio
subsystem to do this choice, not Russell King. If you want only S/PDIF,
it is easy: just declare the S/PDIF DAIs, on both sides, source
(kirkwood) and sinks (tda998x and S/PDIF):

	dai-link@1 {		/* S/PDIF - HDMI */
		cpu {
			sound-dai =3D <&audio1 1>;
		};
		,codec {
			sound-dai =3D <&hdmi 1>;
		};
	};

	dai-link@2 {		/* S/PDIF - S/PDIF */
		cpu {
			sound-dai =3D <&audio1 1>;
		};
		codec {
			sound-dai =3D <&spdif_codec>;
		};
	};

When DPCM will handle the formats and rates, the audio subsystem will
find by itself if such stream will go to the HDMI only or to the S/PDIF
only or to both. The kirwood audio driver will work as it is and the td=
a998x
CODEC will work as it is. There will be no need to change these drivers=
=2E
All we need actually is some more code in DPCM or multi-codec or
whatever mechanism which will route the stream according to the rates
and formats.

Actually, as DPCM does not work, the user has to choose which PCM to
use, otherwise, the application does a format and rate translation.

Anyway, if you want S/PDIF output with the actual kernel (3.16-rc3), in
the DT, put:

	spdif_codec: spdif-codec {
		compatible =3D "linux,spdif-dit";
		#sound-dai-cells =3D <0>;
	};

	sound {
		compatible =3D "simple-audio-card";
		simple-audio-card,name =3D "Cubox Audio";
		simple-audio-card,format =3D "i2s";

		simple-audio-card,dai-link {		/* S/PDIF - S/PDIF */
			simple-audio-card,cpu {
				sound-dai =3D <&audio1 1>;
			};
			simple-audio-card,codec {
				sound-dai =3D <&spdif_codec>;
			};
		};
	};

&audio1 {
	status =3D "okay";
	clocks =3D <&gate_clk 13>, <&si5351 2>;
	clock-names =3D "internal", "extclk";
	pinctrl-0 =3D <&pmx_audio1_i2s1_spdifo &pmx_audio1_extclk>;
	pinctrl-names =3D "default";
	#sound-dai-cells =3D <1>;
};

and the sound should get out of your S/PDIF optical connector.

Eventually, the TDA998x is used in other machines. Are you sure that
the audio controllers of all these machines have a S/PDIF output
connected to the S/PDIF input of the tda998x?

The tda998x CODEC I propose works in all configurations.
