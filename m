Thanks for reviewing!

Sounds great! Let me change to this!

Yeah, this isn't very clear. I figure out something better or perhaps
just drop this.

Yep.

Yeah, I fully agree, this needs to be more clear in the doc.

Yeah, I guess "low power state" or "idle state" is better?

Additionally we mentioning "clusters" here again. I may be difficult
to avoid using that terminology, when describing how things work. I
can try, but perhaps it's just easier to make a statement early on to
describe what "clusters" means in this context? Or what do you think?

Great, thanks!
