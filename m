Totally agree

You're suggesting setting the frequencies, parents etc in the DCD table??
Why?
IMHO that's horribly unreadable.

Yes that's my opinion too.

I think the bootloader should really do as little as possible since:
* It's generally harder and/or riskier to update the bootloader than
the kernel (althugh somewhat less true these days with boot from SD)
* There are multiple bootloaders (u-boot, barebox, ...) but only one kernel
* It makes it easier to do product families where you have a common
bootloader and kernel image with different DTBs per variant. You can
then put all the DTBs in the boot partition and use a bootloader
variable to chose the right one.

Why is this "rediculous" IMHO the kernel shouldn't trust the
bootloader, beyond having setting up the hardware sufficiently to
reliably and safely execute code.

You have to trust the DTB yes but that is not the same as trusting the
bootloader to have setup the hardware.
I fail to see what difference it makes if the DTS is inside or outside
the kernel source. Even today you can compile a DTB from out of tree
DTS and pass it to a mainline kernel.
