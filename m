OK, that sounds doable.

But we end up repeating the same bits over and over again making the device
tree bloated.

I'm suspecting that the initial state can be used to set the PM states for
pins. Probably most pins can have the PM configuration set from the start.

If dynamic muxing is needed, it should be for a very limited set of pins,
and that can be done in the drivers.

You can do just the same from a driver with something like:

	...
	res = pin_config_set_for_pin(pctldev, pin, PIN_STATE_SUSPEND);
	...

As long as the pinconf/pinmux driver knows how to set PIN_STATE_SUSPEND
for one entry. Note that I've avoided using pin_config_set here because
there really should not be any string parsing needed except during driver
init for doing things like this during runtime..

Right, but how many registers are you really writing to? In the cases
I've seen it's mostly just one register. In some cases it can be three
tree registers per mux, but only one would change during runtime
potentially.

Yes but those too should be doable from the device drivers using pin ctrl
framework calls. Usually it's just few pins that needs to change dynamically.

We can have a set of defined states that the pinmux/pinconf drivers can
implement. Then have functions to get/set a mux or a mux group. And then
the triggering could be hooked up into pm_runtime calls just like clock
framework calls.
