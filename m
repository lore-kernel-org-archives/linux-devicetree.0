DTers,

I think the additional benefit of starting with a direct C
implementation is that it causes us to begin to actually
codify the schema requirements.  Sure, it may not be ideal
at first, but over time it may reveal consistent patterns
that can be extracted.  And it may reveal what a real schema
might look like and how it might be expressed better.  Which
is to say that perhaps we are letting "perfect" get in the
way of "good enough to start"?

In the meantime, someone has shown us the code and we can
get started.  It's a Small Matter of Refactoring later. :-)

Just a notion,
