The 200000000 value is not the actual value used in most drivers [1],
but rather the speed of the system clock [2] (hence, my inclination to
make it a root property), the drivers have been pulling this number from
a global variable [3] and dividing/rounding it as needed for their own needs
[1].

Since it's derived from the SoC core [2], it would seem to make sense to
have a root "clock-frequency" in the board dts.  Am I missing something?
Is there a better way to do this?

True, for now, I can just set clock-frequency for each device to the
exact same value and we'll polish later once we have a better idea of
the pattern it's following.

Yes, I don't want to over-think it, but I would like to make sure it's
in the correct place, since it is a global property of the board.

thanks for the review,

Jason.
