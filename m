Well, first, the codecs hdmi and dmic have no DT support.
Then, from the Cubox point of vue, the codec hdmi offers playback
and capture while the Cubox has only playback (via the tda998x HDMI
transmitter), and, also, the codec spdif transmitter has a lot of
sample rates while the Dove audio device supports only 44.1, 48 and 96
kHz.

So, instead of adding new hdmi and spdif_transmitter codecs,
I thought it could be useful to have a generic codec with DT support.

On the other hand, as the first use of this codec is for the Cubox,
an other solution could be to have the codec included in the kirkwood
driver (declared by DT as either i2s or s/pdif). This would simplify
the use or not of s/pdif in this driver.

Indeed, the stream name could be implicit (either "Playback" or
"Capture"), but, as the users are aware of it, a more friendly
name is nicer ("S/PDIF Playback").

I have no idea about which format is used or not, and there is no
explanation about their meanings in the uapi (but I can search them..).

Otherwise, for Dove, we need at least "s16_le", "s24_le" and "s32_le"
and, perhaps, "iec958_subframe_le" and "iec958_subframe_be".

So, what do you think should be the format set?

There cannot be any number because the rates are coded by discrete
values in a bitmap.

=46or the continuous range, I was thinking about the value '0' followed
by the min and max rates. Have you any other syntax in mind?
