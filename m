Hello,

This second patch series is rebased on top of shawn's for-next branch
and tested on Colibri Vybrid VF50 and VF61 modules.

This patchset implements SoC bus support for Freescale Vybrid platform,
implementing the following
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-devices-soc

This a reworked version of an older patchset series posted in June 2015
which was at v5 then [1]. Since the NVMEM framework was then getting
introduced, we decided that first a NVMEM driver for OCOTP peripheral
being in place would be better.

Compared to the older revisions, this driver now relies on NVMEM
consumer API using the NVMEM based vf610_ocotp driver which has
already been in mainline for a while now. Also now a new syscon
abstraction "syscon_regmap_read_from_offset" is implemented and
exported from syscon allowing accessing a register from a syscon
reference like this

ocotp-cfg1 = <&ocotp 0x20>;

avoiding code repetition in the driver.

One point on which we were not sure here is whether we really should
introduce a new Kconfig symbol as being introduced here. While we
could just enable it when SOC_VF610 is selected, this however would
introduce circular dependencies.

Feedback is most welcome.

Changes since v1:
Add device tree binding documentation.
