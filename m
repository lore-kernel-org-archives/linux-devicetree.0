The rewriting I describe is in export_crashk_values() in
arch/powerpc/kernel/machine_kexec.c, where the code deletes existing the
properties, and adds new ones, to the DT exposed to userspace.

So I think we're just quibbling over the definition of "rewrite".

Ok.

My disagreement is with using the DT as a channel to convey information
from the kernel to userspace.

I'm more than happy for a new file or other mechanism to express this
information. For example, we could add
/sys/kernel/kexec_crash_{base,size} or similar.

I'm happy to drop it, then.

Cheers!

Thanks,
