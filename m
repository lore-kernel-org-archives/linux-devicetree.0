This sounds a bit less persuasive to me as we are adding a
DT property that's used to describe a hardware connections
and it would be probably better to mention that the mapping
between the mask and the data lines could be more flexible
than consecutive active data lines as you said previously.

I am leaving this naming to DT maintainer.

To make this patch more convincing, could we add an example
as well in the Example section of this binding file? Like:
	/* RX data lines 0/1 and TX data lines 0/2 are connected */
	fsl,dl-mask = <0x3 0x5>;
