+NXP Audio Mixer (AUDMIX).
+
+The Audio Mixer is a on-chip functional module that allows mixing of two
+audio streams into a single audio stream. Audio Mixer has two input serial
+audio interfaces. These are driven by two Synchronous Audio interface
+modules (SAI). Each input serial interface carries 8 audio channels in its
+frame in TDM manner. Mixer mixes audio samples of corresponding channels
+from two interfaces into a single sample. Before mixing, audio samples of
+two inputs can be attenuated based on configuration. The output of the
+Audio Mixer is also a serial audio interface. Like input interfaces it has
+the same TDM frame format. This output is used to drive the serial DAC TDM
+interface of audio codec and also sent to the external pins along with the
+receive path of normal audio SAI module for readback by the CPU.
+
+The output of Audio Mixer can be selected from any of the three streams
+ - serial audio input 1
+ - serial audio input 2
+ - mixed audio
+
+Mixing operation is independent of audio sample rate but the two audio
+input streams must have same audio sample rate with same number of channel=
s
+in TDM frame to be eligible for mixing.
+
+Device driver required properties:

+  - compatible		: Compatible list, contains "fsl,imx8qm-audmix"
+
+  - reg			: Offset and length of the register set for the device.
+
+  - clocks		: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
+
+  - clock-names		: Must include the "ipg" for register access.
+
+  - power-domains	: Must contain the phandle to AUDMIX power domain node
+
+  - dais		: Must contain a list of phandles to AUDMIX connected
+			  DAIs. The current implementation requires two phandles
+			  to SAI interfaces to be provided, the first SAI in the
+			  list being used to route the AUDMIX output.
+
+  - model		: Must contain machine driver name which will configure
+			  and instantiate the appropriate audio card.
