Agreed. Will adjust accordingly.

Yes, sofpga_cyclone5.dts is the devkit that is manufactured by Altera.
socfpga_vt.dts is a virtual platform for SOCFPGA. You can get the
virtual platform from Synopsis. It mimics everything except the FPGA. 

socfpga is the base SOC with a Cyclone 5 FPGA on it. I'll be upstreaming
socfpga_arria5 soon, which has the SOCFPGA + Arria 5 FPGA.

socfpga.dtsi is the base DTSI for the platform. In hindsight, I should
have named it a bit different, but for now socfpga_cyclone5 is for the
board.

Not sure what you mean by broken. I was able to boot 3.11-rc7 just now
using an initramfs. As you can already tell, I'm doing my best to get
more support for the platform upstream, but it will take time.

In the meantim, you get our latest downstream kernel at:
