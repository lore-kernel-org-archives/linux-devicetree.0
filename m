Correct, I'm behind on emails. I'm following you.

I assume the presence of an IOMMU if used in the guest machine. I wonder
if I can place a check and make the driver fail if IOMMU driver is not present.

Any ideas?

I forgot to mention that these are the only kernel patches. A userspace application
is being built as we speak by another team.

The userspace application will use sysfs to communicate to the management driver. 
The management driver knows how to change runtime characteristics like priority and
weight.

Agreed.

The HW supports changing the QoS values on the flight. In order to locate the
object, I'm exporting a 

I tried to address your concern on v10 last series. Here is brief summary.

Each channel device has a sysfs entry named chid.
What:		/sys/devices/platform/hidma-*/chid
+		/sys/devices/platform/QCOM8061:*/chid


Each management object has one priority and weight file per channel.
+What:		/sys/devices/platform/hidma-mgmt*/chanops/chan*/priority
+		/sys/devices/platform/QCOM8060:*/chanops/chan*/priority

Suppose you want to change the priority of a channel you assigned to guess,
the userspace application goes and reads the chid value of the channel.

Then goes to chanops/chan<chid>/ directory and can change priority and weight 
parameters here.

Here is how the directory looks like. QCOM8060:00 is a management object.
QCOM8061:0x are the channel objects.

/sys/devices/platform/QCOM8060:00# ls
QCOM8061:00
QCOM8061:01
QCOM8061:02
QCOM8061:03
QCOM8061:04
QCOM8061:05
chanops
