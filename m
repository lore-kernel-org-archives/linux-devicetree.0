These patches lay the groundwork for converting the pm8921 sub-devices
to devicetree as well as simplify the API by migrating the core code
to use the regmap API instead of the custom pm8xxx read/write wrapper.

Changes since v3:
 * Added irqdomain Kconfig select
 * New patch to loosen Kconfig on PM8921 config
 * Picked up acked-by

Changes since v2:
 * Picked up reviewed-by tags
 * Fixed irqdomain teardown in driver remove
 * No magical 256 constant
 * Renamed domain to irqdomain
 * Clarified kzalloc call
 * Pushed ssbi regmap helpers into header file
 * Fixed whitespace noise in patch 6

Changes since v1:
 * First 3 cleanup patches dropped because they're applied upstream
 * New regmap read/write helpers
 * New patch for DT match table
 * New binding document
