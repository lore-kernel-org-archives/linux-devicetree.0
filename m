Certainly drivers should not know about clocks outside of their h/w
block, but they absolutely should know if a clock is needed for
wake-up.

Not if the drivers are modules.

I'm not saying this works as-is for you, but people are starting to
add bus properties to buses.

No. The binding just has to work no matter what the OS policy.

Your systems won't go *boom*.

The clock maintainer doesn't want hacks in the clock framework and the
DT maintainer doesn't want them in DT... We should put them in MFD. ;)

Now you are mixing in power domains?

I'm not saying we can't put something in DT. I'm okay with that, but
it needs to handle the case of the clocks do get claimed either after
boot (e.g. by a module) or in later kernels without a dtb change.
