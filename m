So I add a machine driver that selects the clocking freq in hw_params
and calls set_sysclk in the DAIs.

The DT node for the machine driver would look something like:
        default_system_clock_frequency = < xxxxxx >;
        alternate_system_clock_frequency = < xxxxxx >;
        cpu_dai = < &cpu >;
        codec_dai = < &codec >;
        pinctrl... ?

Does this sound ok?  Also, would it make sense to move the pinctrl back
to the machine driver?
