I gave that another try, and it worked like a charm, so it really
looks like an instance of PEBKAC.

I know that some other platforms ask for stdout-path when they review
it, because iirc, barebox uses it to know on which console to output
its log and export its shell, which is also a valid interpretation of
that property, and, contrary to bootargs, doesn't really imply that
the bootloader should update it.
