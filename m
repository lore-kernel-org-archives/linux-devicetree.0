I believe it does, but I suppose I have missed something.

Currently the driver only matches on:
.compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxbb-sm" (drivers/firmware/meson_sm.c)

The only device-tree file using it is 
meson-gx.dtsi: compatible = "amlogic,meson-gx-sm", "amlogic,meson-gxbb-sm";

So:
1) yes the order is backward (thx for pointing this out)
2) by changing the compatible matched by the driver from "amlogic,meson-gxbb-sm" 
to "amlogic,meson-gx-sm", I don't think I am breaking anything. Feel free to
point out why this is wrong because I don't get it.

except that the DT file where it is used is a soc family dtsi.
meson-gx.dtsi is the common DT for gxbb and gxl family. Wouldn't it make sense 
to have the SoC generic compatible alone here ? and override it in the SoC DT if
necessary ?

Honestly, I don't care which of the 2 solutions we take. The important thing for
me is to eliminate the confusion introduced by the generic-compatible being here
and useless. The driver is indeed generic, but the related compatible is not
matched. This makes no sense.

So either:
* we use "vendor,soc-one", "vendor,family" model: I believe this what I'm trying
 to do here. For this, we need to match the soc generic compatible in the
driver.

* we use the "vendor,soc-two", "vendor,soc-one" model : The driver keeps on
matching the SoC specific compatible. We won't ever match the generic one with
this model, what is the point of keeping it around in DT ? Should we remove it ?

Maybe the later is better, it would end up just being a removal of an
undocumented property from DT.
