Nothing, but what would trigger them? This is after the arch code has brought up
secondaries, but before user space is running.


No events are registered by this point, so all that could go wrong is a
freshly-arrived CPU is unmasked, then this probe method fails and assumes it
left cores masked. If you think its possible I can post a patch to bolt it down
some more.

Thanks for taking a look!


Thanks,

James
