This only works for describing what's on the connector, but does
nothing for describing downstream devices on the connector. We already
have a way to do the former with label properties at least for uart,
i2c and spi. And gpio has it's own method of labeling lines.

David G has suggested using aliases (in this node, not top-level) for
this purpose of mapping things like spi and i2c, and I think that's a
good use of aliases (versus spi and i2c aliases at the top level which
I don't). The hard part is still how to structure the child devices.

We defined 'gpio-map' specifically for handling GPIOs thru connectors.
It's in the DT spec (though not a released version yet). Use it here.

Sorry, but the only halfway solution I'm going to accept is one which
can evolve into a full solution. Define the basic structure and add
each interface one by one. Maybe that starts with just:

lscon: connector {
       compatible = "96boards,low-speed-connector";
};

That's not really my recommendation as that's really just kicking the
can down the road.
