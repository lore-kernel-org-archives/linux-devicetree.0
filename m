Russell,

the above absolute addresses already made me think of cleaning up dove
pinctrl a while ago. I also had in mind that below function exclusively
request ownership of global config registers.

We have no peripheral clock handling for Dove, yet. Just core clocks and
clock gates are implemented. And I guess they are DT only anyway.

Yeah, sure. We have the same issue with watchdog driver messing with
timer registers. There I exported a function to _clrset TIMER_CTRL
register safely. Just went into irqchip (tip for-next).

I am fine with a generic modify function with a single lock. Most cases
should be fine with a single lock even for non-related register
accesses, e.g. watchdog will access TIMER_CTRL only once to enable
itself. If you think you need a special lock because you have a lot of
writes to shared registers, you can still have your own modify lock.
