Hmmm. So how do we get to a decision on this then?

I was a little nervous about potentially having some *.dts be primary
source files, and others be derived from *.dtsp (assuming that we
convert platforms to this new feature as desired, rather than en-mass).
It seems like it'd just cause confusion; people might just end up
accidentally editing a *.dts that was generated without realizing it.
