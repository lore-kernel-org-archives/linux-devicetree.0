Hi Tomi

I took a look at the TLC59108. The hardware designs have not made it
easy, but it does look similar enough that my driver can be extended
to cover both. These extensions It will not change the DT binding, it
will just gain a new compatibility string. So i would prefer my driver
is first fully reviewed and accepted, and then i will take a stab at
extending it for the TLC59108. I will need help testing it, but i hope
you can help there.
