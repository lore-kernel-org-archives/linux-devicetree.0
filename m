You'd also need to do get/put on the children, but yes, that's what Ben
is suggesting.

However, the problem with all of the solutions proposed (runtime PM ones
included) is that we're forcing a board-specific design issue (2 devices
sharing a reset line) into a driver that should not have any
board-specific assumptions in it.

For example, if this driver is used on another platform where different
PHYs have different reset lines, then one of them (the unlucky one who
is not probed first) will never get reset.  So any form of per-device
ref-counting is not a portable solution.

I'm not sure yet how the reset framework is supposed to handle shared
reset lines, but that needs some investigation.  I quick glance and it
seems that reset controllers can have shared lines, so that should be
investigated.
