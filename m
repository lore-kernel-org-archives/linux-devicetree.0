There are lots of possible representations in DT that would solve this.

First of all, a device node can be turned into a platform_device but
does not have to, so you you could have one DT node for the common
parts (the pcp), and then subnodes underneath it, and have the driver
attach to the main device but parse the subnodes manually to see
what registers are there. There is no magic involved here, and this
would address the concerns that Boris and I have.

Another option would be to have multiple drivers: have one driver
that handles the common parts here, and make that export a shared
interface to which the other drivers can register, then create
five drivers that each do one thing. In my opinion that would work
just as well, and be a nice abstraction, but I suspect that Boris
would prefer doing it the other way.

I don't think there is a huge risk that other ARM drivers would copy a bad
design, when it's obviously bad. In particular, other chips will most
likely have other requirements in this area.

If this is something that does not fit into existing categories, you
probably want to create your own high-level abstraction between the
accesses to the shared parts of the driver and the parts that can
exist in multiple instances. This will work for either of the approaches
I've described above.
