Put it differently. OpenBSD might have much better clock support.
Imagine it can dynamically figure out the correct esdhc frequencies
for different usecases on the fly. In this situation it would be
counterproductive if Linux requires static values for these in the
devicetree.

The codec could be provided a phandle to the cko clk. This is hardware
description and is fine for putting into the devicetree.

What stops us doing so is that currently we have the policy that the
devicetree is hardware description only, even if there are already
counteraxamples in the devicetree.

I know that we currently have no place to put such information. There
recently was a similar discussion with CMA descriptions in the
devicetree and I remember several other discussions of the same type,
all of which ended at the dont-know-but-not-in-the-devicetree point.
