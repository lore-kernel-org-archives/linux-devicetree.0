Registering the driver earlier won't cause any bugs. However, it's not
the correct approach.

Deferred probe /is/ the approach for assuring correct dependencies
between drivers. It works and should be used. There are not enough
initcall levels to play games using initcalls and solve all the issues,
and the ordering requirements vary board-to-board. Deferred probe at
runtime handles this without having to manually place all the drivers
into specific initcall levels, and dynamically adjusts to board
differences, since it all happens automatically at run-time.

Consider a SoC that has:

* An external PMIC, which the CPU has to communicate with to enable
power to all SoC components outside the CPU and a single I2C instance
dedicated to communicating with the PMIC.
* An on-SoC reset controller (for on-SoC) modules that resets other
on-SoC I2C controllers
* An on-SoC I2C controller which communicates with a GPIO expander
* One of the GPIOs on that expander is the reset GPIO for some other
device connected by I2C

What initcall levels are you going to use for all the drivers
(PM-related I2C, PMIC, on-SoC reset controller, secondary I2C
controller, GPIO expander IC, GPIO-reset "device", the final device
affected by the GPIO reset controller).

Now wonder whether that same order is going to be suitable for every
single other board. That's quite unlikely...

Yes, deferred probe will happen. If we want to solve that, I believe we
need a more generic solution specifically targeted at that, rather that
playing games with initcalls.

(It'd be nice if each DT node declared all its resources in a way the DT
core could parse them and determine the dependency graph itself, without
having to write code in all drivers to extract that information from DT.
This would need a standardized resource representation in DT, and as
such would mean throwing out all the bindings and starting again...
Perhaps some parallel set of properties could be invented to hint at the
order, but still fall back to deferred probe where that information was
missing or inaccurate.)
