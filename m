We are debating whether we should setup a company server (where we can
have full control about storage, user permissions, backup, ...) or
just use github.com to host our X-Gene kernel tree.

Github seems already provide everything we need for a public source
tree. Per your experience, what is your (and probably other
maintainers) reference in git hosting server? Is there any
inconvenience or difficulty for the maintainers to pull/merge code
from Github versus from a company server?

Thanks!
