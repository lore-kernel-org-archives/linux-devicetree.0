The main users I can think of for this would be PMUs in multi-cluster systems,
where we may have differing PMUs in each cluster. The driver for each needs to
know the set of CPUs it's handling, and which CPU each interrupt is affine to.

With the above binding scheme, we'd describe the A15x2 A7x3 CoreTile's PMUs
something like:

pmu_a15s {
	compatible = "arm,cortex-a15-pmu";
	interrupts = <0 68 4>,
	             <0 69 4>;
	interrupts-affinity = <0 0x0>,
	                      <0 0x1>;
};

pmu_a7s {
	compatible = arm,cortex-a7-pmu";
	interrupts = <0 128 4>,
	             <0 129 4>,
	             <0 130 4>;
	interrupts-affinity = <0 0x100>,
	                      <0 0x101>,
	                      <0 0x102>;
};

I envisage that each driver that requires this information would request it
manually when parsing the dt, and storing what it needs in an appropriate
datastructure. For PMUs this could be something like:

struct irq_affinity {
	cpumask_t mask;
	int irq;
} interrupt_data[];

When setting up or tearing down interrupts, each CPU can find which
interrupt(s) it needs, and whether it's a PPI or SPI by iterating over the list
and checking against a cpumask, and perform the appropriate steps to setup or
teardown.

Other devices may need affinity information (e.g. which CPUs are connected to
the ACE ports on CCI) and can be handled by a similar binding.

Thanks,
Mark.
