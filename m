Sure thing, thanks.

Ok.

I would like to ask for others' opinion for multiple reasons, and would  
decide in v3 based on that.

- The device is called the "mamba", the marketing name is the WRT1900AC.  
As history showed, it's perfectly possible that exactly the same device go  
on the market under a different name. The E4200v2 is the same device as  
the EA4500, with a different factory firmware. There the name of the  
device is "viper".

- OpenWrt is the only firmware/stack other than the official one and  
people already know this device as "mamba".

- Let's say the same device gets released under the same name or just the  
radios change - so no redesign takes place at all. In my opinion that  
hardly justifies adding multiple .dts files just to change the name of the  
LEDs to reflect that. I think people who want to run mainline on their  
device wouldn't be concerned about seeing a codename, but on the other  
hand we could receive patches to "correct" the marketing name in the LEDs.

Do you mean serial console pinout?

Ok, I have that locally already, too.

See below.

I've thought that would look kinda awkward, hence I left it this way.

The gap and the overlapping partitions (pretty much the whole layout) are  
straight from the official firmware. The overlap is used to flash a single  
file which contains the rootfs, too.

See above.
