Do we encourage people to use it instead of %pOF cases where it is suitable?

Do we support swnode here?

Just put there a NULL pointer, we would not like to maintain duplicated strings
over the kernel.

I remember Petr has a patch series related to address space check, though I
don't remember the status of affairs.

I don't see test cases.

What would we get out of %pfwfffPPPfff?

Hint: I'm expecting above to be equivalent to %pfwf
