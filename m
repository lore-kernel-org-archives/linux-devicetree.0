Ok, I'm not very used with the CCF, so perhaps clk_name is not needed at all. I
gave a try with the following combination:

 - con_id = NULL, dev_id = clk_name
 - con_id = clk_name, dev_id = NULL
 - con_id = NULL, dev_id = NULL

All worked.

And finally I removed the clk_hw_register_clkdev() call and it worked also.

So I'm not sure about this function.

Any idea ?
