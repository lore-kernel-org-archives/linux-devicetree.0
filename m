the thing is, a device node name is expected to comply with ePAPR or
the devicetree specification, which says

	The name of a node should be somewhat generic, reflecting
	the function of the device and not its precise programming model.

If devicetree and CCF maintainers are fine with 'rcc', I won't object,
my role is just to emphasize the found issue and recommend to use another
and more common name 'clock-controller', it is a simple and fortunately
backward compatible change to other ST platforms as well.
