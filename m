This adds a compatible string for the Texas Instruments CC2560 Bluetooth
chip to the existing TI WiLink shared transport bindings. These chips are
similar enough that the same bindings work for both. The file is renamed
to ti-bluetooth.txt to make it more generic.

+This documents the binding structure and common properties for serial

+binding:

 TI WiLink devices have a UART interface for providing Bluetooth, FM radio,
 and GPS over what's called "shared transport". The shared transport is
 standard BT HCI protocol with additional channels for the other functions.
