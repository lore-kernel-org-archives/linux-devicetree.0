Hi Russell,

Yes, that's a big reason why I added this capability. The v4l2-ctl
tool won't accept subdev nodes, although Philipp Zabel has a quick hack
to get around this (ignore return code from VIDIOC_QUERYCAP).

Actually v4l2_dev->ctrl_handler is not of much use to me. This will
compose a list of controls from all registered subdevs, i.e. _all
possible controls_.

What v4l2_pipeline_inherit_controls() does is compose a list of
controls that are reachable and available in the currently configured
pipeline.
