I'll admit I'm a little fuzzy on the differences between dual and quad
modes on various flash manufacturers. Can you help clear it up for me?
I think some of the comments on patch 2 help too, but I'll just comment
here for now.

It looks like the current driver has problems regarding the non 1-x-y
modes (e.g., 4-4-4), right? But I see that spi-nor.c never tries to
send a 4_4_4 command; it only sets read_opcode to
SPINOR_OP_READ_1_1_{1,2,4}. So is this an oversight in patches like
Bean's patch?

    commit 548cd3ab54da ("mtd: spi-nor: Add quad I/O support for Micron
    SPI NOR")

Why would we even need to enable quad modes like that, if we're not
going to send the 4-4-4 opcodes?

My next question (if my understanding is roughly correct) is, do we need
the 4-4-4 modes, and what risks come with them? I understand we can
shorten the command and address phases, but does that alone yield much
performance benefit? And I think the risk is that a given system might
not be prepared for the flash to be in a 4-4-4 mode, if the boot code
tries to use 1-x-y commands.

Also, I see a lot of good comments in patch 2 about Spansion vs.
Macronix vs. Micron memories. I wonder if previous developers have
completely tested their patches, or if they're just reading the
datasheets... so, what kind have testing have you done? Do you have
samples of all these flash to test?

Regards,
Brian
