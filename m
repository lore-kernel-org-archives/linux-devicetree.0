I thought ia64 used to, but it has been a long time since I've touched
one...

Sure, I ment, after Liviu's patch it will become required since he is
cleverly using it to figure out what the io mapping the bridge driver
setup before calling the helper.

Okay, that was one of the 'legacy reasons'. Certainly lots of drivers
do call pci_iomap, but if you think legacy drivers that don't are
important to ARM64 then it makes sense to use the virtual IO window.

Mainly we get to drop the fancy dynamic allocation stuff for the fixed
virtual window, and it gives the option to have a 1:1 relationship
between CPU addresses and PCI BARs.

Yes, /dev/port needs updating, it would need to iomap (arguably it
probably should be doing that already anyhow), and the hardwired limit
of 65536 needs to be replaced with the arch's IO limit, but those do
not seem to be fundemental problems with the UAPI??
