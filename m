Will update Kconfig to make it n by default.

On Seattle platform SoC generates a interrupt on both single bit and double bit error
and that interrupt is handled by firmware, so we don't need to do anything in the driver.
Driver just need to poll registers to log correctable errors (because they do not generate interrupt).
This very driver is doing exactly what we want. DT binding is not required.

But Hanjun's comment on very first patch hinted me that there is possibility that
SoC generate a interrupt on single bit and double bit but firmware does not handle it.
In those cases driver will need be extended to handle interrupt.

I will submit v3 for review with DT binding removed. We can revisit DT binding need in future.
