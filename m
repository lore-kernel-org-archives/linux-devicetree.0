Hi Sören,

Thank you for your remarks. I corrected a few things as you suggested.

I did not test with any external debug tools. For testing, I obtained
trace for simple function (e.g. loop) on Xilinx standalone and I then
traced the same function under Linux. Then, I compare both traces
obtained under standalone and under Linux. I decoded the trace to make
  sure that the trace I get corresponds to my function. The instructions
for testing here only allows users to see that coresight components
are enabled and generating traces. The trace still need to be decoded
to make sure whether the trace is correct or not. It can be done by
openCSD[1] library.

 > Use labels please.
I changed the entries to use labels. I don't need phandle anymore.

The TPIU setup included in my patch is specific to my configuration of TPIU.
The second clock is configurable but I didn't know how to do so. As in
Vivado setup I chose "fclk1" as the clock for TPIU, I decided to put fclk1.
But, I am not sure about this. I am having some problems when I recover the
trace from TPIU: it is not the same as in ETB even though it resembles a 
lot.
I don't know if the problem is coming from the device tree or from the 
driver.
I will have a look at 'dbg_trc' clock.

The first name was chosen as "apb_pclk" because it was recommended in
Documentation. On the second name, I agree with you but again for TPIU DT
entry, I am not sure how to make this clock configurable. So, that's why
I put the same clock name as I had in my Vivado setup. If you have any
leads on how to make it configurable, I will be happy to take a look
into it.

This property was described in clock binding (in an example [2]) and the
value here (250MHz) corresponds to the value I had chosen in Vivado for
TPIU input clock.

Yes, I modified the patch to take care of it. Thank you.
