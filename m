This looks wrong: the #address-cells property in a device node is used
to parse the reg property of its child nodes, not the node itself.

The only way to list memory like this is to put #size-cells=<2>
into the root node. All lower bus nodes can then use the
normal #address-cells/#size-cells again and use a ranges property
to convert the register ranges so you don't need to update all
nodes.
