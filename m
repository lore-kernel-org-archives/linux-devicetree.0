Well, there are typically three ways to find a node; by name, by
device_type and by compatible.  device_type is meaningless for the
flattened tree, so that's out.  Matching by name could potentially
have namespace collisions, but I'm not sure.  I'll defer to Ben &
Mitch's judgment here.

The difference with aliases, cpus and memory nodes is that the
conventions around them were defined and agreed on a very long time
ago.  We could get consensus to do the same here, but I cannot make
that call.

aliases is not a vendor-specific or limited scope convention.
