You are right, of course, that has-spdif-foo properties are useless,
for the driver and the DT. For a working audio setup, we need to link
the codecs anyway and we can put that information in there.

Taking the sound node above:

sound {
	compatible = "whatever-audio";
	...
	audio-codec = <&rt1234 1>, <&spdif 0>;
	audio-codec-names = "i2s", "spdifo";
	...
};

Each audio-codec phandle with arg links to one specific "port" at some
"codec". The audio-codec-names property allows the ASoC driver to
determine the local "ports" where the above codecs are connected.
The dummy codecs are ASoC specific and must be added by the driver.

Basically, it is the same approach as we have for clocks, maybe the 
property names are not best suited, but it should give an impression of
how it _could_ be done.

Unfortunately, the fsl spdif discussion I referenced earlier ended up
with
a) a special machine driver and its own DT binding
b) using that "has" properties approach

> 2. DAPM routes to connect the CPU DAI audio stream(s) to the Codec stream(s)

I am not yet sure how that could be solved easily with DT, nor if it
should go in there at all. But I have not dug into ASoC and DAPM enough.

Can you point out, given the above linking, what you think is missing
to allow the driver to find all it needs wrt to DAIs and DAPM?
