Looks nice and clean to me. There is still some feedback though.

One thing missing is DIV4.5 clock. It will be nice to add that too,
mostly just because it will make the binding complete.

I don't think the reference clock input handling is fully correct/flexible.

There are two ways to provide input clock (ref_clk) to PLL. Either use
the internal oscillator with a crystal connected between OSCIN and
OSCOUT (CLKMODE = 0) or a clean clock input (CLKMODE = 1) connected to
OSCIN (OSCOUT disconnected).

This is a board specific decision. On the LogicPD EVM, the former option
is used, on the LCDK board, the later.

So, I think what we need is a DT property like
"ti,davinci-use-internal-osc" for the PLL. Boards can set or ignore it
and you can switch CLKMODE on or off based on that.

Setting CLKMODE = 1 will switch off the internal oscillator (and
presumably save power), but it does not act as a mux. This explains why
not worrying about setting this correctly in current mainline still works.

I am also not sure if we really need PLL_HAS_OSCIN since all DaVinci
SoCs set it anyway.

Thanks,
Sekhar
