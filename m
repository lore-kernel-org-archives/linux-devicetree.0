Hi Aleksandr,

You misunderstand: The point would be to use, e.g., "emlid,neutis-n5"
instead of "emlid,emlid-neutis-n5" with duplicate "emlid,emlid-". It is
orthogonal to having multiple compatible strings.

Not quite, we're missing a child node within uart1 for a serdev driver.
Is there no such driver yet for your Bluetooth chipset, or did you not
yet check?

What about just keeping the common nodes enabled in a SoM .dts, so that
the average board doesn't need an Overlay for booting?

@Maxime/Rob, is it possible to merge .dtso files these days? If not,
could that be considered in the big dts Makefile refactoring? :)

Cheers,
Andreas
