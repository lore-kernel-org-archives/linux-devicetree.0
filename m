Not sure what you mean by "using" this...

I have patches which use this to add DT-based modalias entries for
module auto-loading to i2c and sunxi-rsb that I haven't sent.

As far as DT usage goes, we already need this for the axp20x mfd driver.
There are 2 variants, i2c and sunxi-rsb. For the I2C variant a fix was
sent to fix module auto-loading by using the I2C client ID table:

    mfd: axp20x-i2c: Add i2c-ids to fix module auto-loading
    https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/lee/mfd.git/commit/?h=for-mfd-next&id=b7142a19321484bd7681aa547c1d50148c8e2825

But for the sunxi-rsb variant such a fix does not exist, as the bus
does not have a separate ID table. It uses DT exclusively.
