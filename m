Maybe what I wrote wasn't entirely clear. I completely agree with this
patch.

The TWD on Cortex-A9 is a CPU local timer, same as the architected
timer in later cores. It doesn't provide all the benefits of the
architected timer (the clock frequency varies with CPU core clock and
it's not virt capable), but some systems still prefer it over the i.MX
GPT, as it provides much better wakeup granularity.

So annotating the CPU idle states with the timer stop flag is the right
thing to do. This flag has nothing to with the usage of GPT or TWD on a
specific system.
