Yes they can continue that, but SCMI just doesn't depend on that.

Yes I am aware of that.

Exactly, now with SCMI, every controller *can do* that, as we just care
about the signaling which in other terms I have so far referred as
"doorbell". The data passed should not be used for any other purpose
as there's no need to even by the remote firmware implementing SCMI.

If you read the SCMI specification, it's designed to avoid all such
issues with wide variety of mailbox controller we have in the wild.
And hence all the command and other information are passed in the shared
memory.

What do you mean by abusing the API ?

Exactly, if and only if they adhere to the specification.

OK, if platform had to send some platform specific data, I agree. But
can you point me from the SCPI specification the need for the platforms
to do that. That's the whole point. Transport is just a doorbell nothing
more.

You are trying to fit the existing platform implementation into SCMI
which won't work.

E.g. if TI/Rockchip implements SCMI, they can continue using these
drivers as along as it does the job of "ringing the doorbell".

They may be passing some data today because their existing remote
firmware expects it. With SCMI, they don't have to. These existing
drivers are doing additional job in the current form: passing some data
along with triggering the remote doorbell. We just need latter in SCMI
case as we don't need any data in the transport as it's all part of shmem.

Why do you think that won't work ? Remember all the platform specific
stuff(if platform implement own protocols) in SCMI is moved to the
shared memory and transport just needs to do "doorbell". So I disagree
with your concern unless I am missing something.

Definitely neither SCMI specification nor SCMI driver is ruling out any
class of mailbox controllers as long as there are capable of signaling
the other end that "hey look you have something to check in shared
memory" which I think is the case with most of the controllers.

To be honest this whole mailbox framework is somewhat complex for simple
doorbell kind of this, but hey I am not complaining ;).
