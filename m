Well, they get ranges right because they don't get an address
otherwise. The problem on dma-ranges is the bus we describe is the
slave side, not the master side. So a given bus may have a mixture of
DMA capable devices and non-DMA capable devices. If we're still
setting DMA masks on all the devices, what have we gained? Maybe we
could get stricter on PCI buses at least.

I'm fine with the change as is, it's really just the commit text I'm
commenting on.
