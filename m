Judging by <linux/perf_event.h> config_base is an unsigned long, which
will be 64 bit for arm64, which is the only place this is used.

So unless I've missed something, that should be ok, no?

Well, it could be a larger value depending on the latency.

We handle the wraparound when we caluclate the delta below. By setting
the interrupt to occur within half of the max period (as per the arm-cci
driver), we avoid (with a high degree of certainty) the risk of
overtaking the prev raw count again before handlnig the IRQ.

The raw_* values above should be the *raw* values from the HW, as their
names imply.

Interesting; I see we do that in the CCI PMU driver. What are we trying
to protect?

We don't do that in the CPU PMU drivers, and I'm missng something here.
Hopefully I'm just being thick...

Thanks,
Mark.
