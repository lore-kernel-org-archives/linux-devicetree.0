I'd specifically like Mark's ack on this one.

I'd prefer this be "secure-foo" and "foo", rather than reg given I 
specifically have a differing opinion on how to support reg.

Also, would it be secure-vendor,foo or vendor,secure-foo for properties 
with vendor prefix? The latter looks more correct to me, but the former 
would be easier to search for both variants of the property. I'd lean 
towards the latter.
