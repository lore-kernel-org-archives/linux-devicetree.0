OK, that makes sense to me, if those registers live in addresses ranges
which correspond to different IP blocks.

This doesn't make sense to me. If I understand correctly, the register
range that controls the post-divider clock (e.g. axi21) is the same
register range that control's genpll. This is a reasonable indicator to
me that the leaf clocks are part of the same clock generator IP block as
the PLL controls. As such they should be on node.

Sure, my argument above doesn't hinge on the fact that the pll and child
clocks use the exact same register. It still looks to me like *pll and
it's child dividers belong in the same IP block. Is there an open data
sheet or technical reference manual I can look at for this part? That is
the best way to put my concerns at ease ;-)

Looking over your binding again, it looks like your nodes are divided
conveniently for the different clock types (e.g. pll versus
post-divider), but our goal with DT is to accurately describe the
hardware, not the C structures.
