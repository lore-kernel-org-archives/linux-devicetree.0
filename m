I'm just not happy about the complexity of this function, but perhaps
it's confusing to always set them, regardless of them being used. Feel
free to keep it.

It's a rarely used feature and I don't see a reason for using it here.

It's probably better to make a copy of cur.cb and cur.ctx to make their
use after the spin-unlock more obvious (but should be fine as the
spinlock is for the pending_wr array.

The fact that this seems to describe a physical ring buffer, with some
set of properties that are related to how a ring buffer works in the
Qualcomm hardware and it carries a notion of physical mapping, all
indicates to me that this describes some Qualcomm hardware interface.

I believe this is a hardware implementation detail that should reside in
the hardware part of the implementation (i.e. the Qualcomm driver).
