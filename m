Removal of the SoC specific compatible and breaking compatibility.
Kevin says compatibility is not broken, but it obviously it based on
the example and the driver change. So that can only mean your dts file
doesn't match the example.

That's backwards if I understand this right. It should be most
specific first, but that's a separate issue.

Why? That's how DT works and every other platform follows. Either you have:

"vendor,soc-one", "vendor,family"
"vendor,soc-two", "vendor,family"

or

"vendor,soc-one"
"vendor,soc-two", "vendor,soc-one"

The latter is how DT has existed and worked for 20+ years. The former
is what we allow because for some reason people have such an aversion
to saying soc2 is compatible with soc1.

Either one is fine, but the documentation must be clear what the
constraints are for the dts file. For example, "vendor,soc-two" or
"vendor,family" alone are not valid. There's plenty of examples to
follow. Renesas is one using "vendor,family" extensively.

Binding docs may live in the kernel, but they are separate from
drivers. They describe the constraints of the dts files. There's no
reason to document what the driver wants because I can read the driver
source. I can't say the same thing about the dts file. The dts may not
come from the kernel and one dts file is not all possible options for
a given binding.
