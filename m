For the clk-si5351 programmable clock driver in mainline, it already
uses "clock-frequency" for initial clock setup but allows to set it
later on. IMHO that is ok, because from a initial point-of-view, an
initial frequency is fixed. As soon as the driver takes over, the user
is free to do whatever he wants and should not be limited by DT.

But if we vote against that approach, we should probably also modifiy
clk-si5351 accordingly.
