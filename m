I figured out that others are starting to have patches that depend on my
other patchsets getting merged. Those patches are for the fwnode property
API that most likely should go through the linux-pm tree as well as for the
media tree.

I have hopes of being able to get the fwnode cleanup patchset (which the
aforementioned patches depend on) in within this merge window --- assuming I
could have your ack on the OF portions.

Would it be possible to have an immutable branch for these or would you
accept a pull request on v4.12-rc1?

Thanks.
