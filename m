I think we can say that the reg property must correspond to a cluster
id, irrespective of the MPIDR. Whatever it is, as you said, a platform
has to have a cluster numbering scheme. How it is mapped to the MPIDR
that's platform specific. So I am happy to add a reg property but
linking it to the MPIDR goes against what we are doing here hence I
would not do it, simply because we can't say "cluster reg property must
be MPIDR[15:8]", that's wrong and there is precious little we can do
about that.
