GPLv2-only devicetrees make reuse difficult for software components
licensed under a different license. In particular, the Utilite Pro
devicetree file (which includes on imx6q-cm-fx5.dts) is already dual
licensed under GPLv2/X11.

Hence, relicense imx6q-cm-fx6.dts under GPLv2/X11 dual license.

Changes since v1:
 - new patch in v2; without it the dual licensed of the imx6q-utilite-pro.dts
   is not really useful because it includes imx6q-cm-fx6.dts.
