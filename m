If another platform type comes up with this particular gem, we can
always create a specific symbol. In the meantime, you can keep simple.

Not really. I cannot bring myself to care about that kind of thing...

You can use the _relaxed version when there is no dependency with a
memory access before (for a write) that needs to be propagated to the
device before the MMIO access takes place. In your case, the device (the
irqchip) never reads anything from memory, so there is strictly no need
to issue a dsb on each MMIO write.

Forget it. I read the above "unlock" as a "lock", and everything went
downhill. Too much crap code today, I see it everywhere.

Well, good luck to them.

Certainly not. Dealing with the interrupt controller is the job of the
irqchip driver, hence no need to pollute the drivers. What you're doing
is fine, though masking the interrupt on error is a bit heavy handed...

Indeed.

I'd feel more comfortable with that. Just return -EINVAL.

None. This looks like fishy/undocumented HW, so whatever floats your
boat will work for me. The struct seem slightly overkill given the
information it provides, but that's your choice.
