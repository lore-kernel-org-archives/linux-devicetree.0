So what happens if we have a set of modules which use deferred probing
in order to work?

For example, with sound stuff built as modules, and auto-loaded in
parallel by udev, the modules get added in a random order.  The
modules have non-udev obvious dependencies between them (resource
dependencies) which result in deferred probing being necessary to
bring the device up.

Eg,

snd_soc_kirkwood_spdif module declares the ASoC card.
snd_soc_spdif_tx is a codec as a loadable module.
snd_soc_kirkwood is the CPU digital audio interface module.

What I commonly see is this module load order:

snd_soc_kirkwood_spdif, then snd_soc_kirkwood and then snd_soc_spdif_tx.

This results at boot in:

kirkwood-spdif-audio audio-subsystem: ASoC: CPU DAI kirkwood-fe not registered
kirkwood-spdif-audio audio-subsystem: ASoC: CPU DAI kirkwood-fe not registered
kirkwood-spdif-audio audio-subsystem: ASoC: CPU DAI kirkwood-fe not registered
kirkwood-spdif-audio audio-subsystem: ASoC: CPU DAI kirkwood-fe not registered
kirkwood-spdif-audio audio-subsystem: ASoC: CPU DAI kirkwood-fe not registered
kirkwood-spdif-audio audio-subsystem: ASoC: CODEC DAI dit-hifi not registered
kirkwood-spdif-audio audio-subsystem: ASoC: CODEC DAI dit-hifi not registered
kirkwood-spdif-audio audio-subsystem: snd-soc-dummy-dai <-> kirkwood-fe mapping ok
kirkwood-spdif-audio audio-subsystem: multicodec <-> kirkwood-spdif mapping ok

at boot, where most of these are deferred probe attempts.

So, disabling deferred probing after all the kernel-internal initcalls
are run is wrong.  You can have deferred probing required due to
external modules, and this can kick in at any time (think about
hot-pluggable hardware with a driver that's somehow componentised,
like an audio device...)
