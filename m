Hello,

This mini-series adds initial support for the Realtek RTD1295 SoC and
the Zidoo X9S TV box.

With these patches CPU0 can be booted with earlycon.

PSCI doesn't work despite present in the vendor device tree; as enable-method
it instead used a custom "rtk-spin-table" that I sadly have no source code of.

The UARTs use a custom interrupt controller that I again lack source code of;
with interrupts = <GIC_SPI 41 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH> it can boot into an initrd.

The boot process is slightly twisted: The files need to be loaded from a
32-bit U-Boot, then boot into 64-bit U-Boot where the kernel can be booted.
Similar to my previous Amlogic S905 work, the TEXT_OFFSET poses a problem, so
a uImage needs to be used (or the kernel patched) for load address 0x00280000.
I haven't succeeded loading an initrd via bootm/booti; but as quick workaround
initrd=$rootfs_loadaddr,0x$filesize can manually be specified in $bootargs.

Cf. https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:Zidoo_X9S

KVM appears to initialize okay, but was not yet tested with QEMU.

[    0.256947] kvm [1]: 8-bit VMID
[    0.256986] kvm [1]: IDMAP page: 73b000
[    0.257025] kvm [1]: HYP VA range: 800000000000:ffffffffffff
[    0.257458] kvm [1]: Hyp mode initialized successfully
[    0.257529] kvm [1]: virtual timer IRQ3

Have a lot of fun!

Cheers,
