I was referring to /dev node names like sda/sdb/sdc or ttyS0/ttyS1.

Yeah, that's a bit different.

That is specifically for CPUs though, right? Is the same true here? If
so, I guess this is fine. A set of indexes for any device on a bus
would be more concerning.

I'm no fan of aliases either, but just trying to keep some consistency
in how we deal with various problems. My main concern is folks trying
to create some made-up index numbering of devices. Often it's not
really needed as there are other ways to address or identify devices.
In many cases we end up using 'reg' if there's no other means of
addressing a device.

We've generally standardized around "label" for things like slots,
ports, connectors, etc. that need to be physically identified.
"slot-names" it seems hasn't gotten used for FDT. Since there aren't
DT's published for OF based systems nor any documentation, newbies
like me (that only have 8 years of DT experience) don't have any
insight into how things used to be done.
