One more thing regarding aliases.
In future patches, I will add alsa controls to configure sai.
Some stm32 socs exhibit several sai (4 instances for H7)
It will be necessary to identify to which sai each control apply,
through the control names:
	SAI1A control X
	SAI2A control X
	...
sub-node compatible already allows to identify A or B sub-instance.

An alternative to alias, may be to use dev_name information to identify 
sai instance. But this does not produce user friendly control names.

Another way is to use compatible also. The drawback here
is to multiply compatible names. (many soc families and many instances)

What is your recommendation ?
If there is another solution, I did not consider, please let me know.

Right, it should not be too complicated to add mclk-fs support to 
graph-card.
