I'm still learning about DT so my inputs should be weighed, measured and
then promptly thrown out. With that said I recently published an RFC to
convert the OMAP4 PRCM clocks to DT and my approach was a single node
per clock.

The register mapping for those clocks is mostly orderly, but not so
orderly that a neat and tidy tuple would suffice.  Also the recent MMP
clock series represents many of the clocks as single nodes.

I am not opposed to this design choice and it removes more data from C
files.  Some concerns were brought up about impacts to boot time but no
one has quantified that yet.

Regards,
Mike
