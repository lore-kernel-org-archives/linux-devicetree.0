Understood. I did get a conditional ACK from Rob Herring on the DT 
portion of the patch from the last revision (as long as I made the 
changes he suggested which I did in this patch). There may be other 
comments though.

Those are the only cases of irq but it would be good to be alerted if 
that is not the case. I will add. Thanks!

Yes, thanks. I was using the xgene code as an example but I missed the 
unregister (although it looks like the xgene's unregister affects sysfs 
instead of debugfs). I'm also moving the debugfs creation to the end of 
the probe since it is not critical and avoids an error path if creation 
fails.

I'll make the debugfs_remove_recursive() change as a separate patch in 
my next version.

Thanks for reviewing!
