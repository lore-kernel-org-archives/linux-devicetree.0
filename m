Certainly having lots of properties prefixed this way is not what I

I assume neither property present or both okay also mean the same.

status = "okay"; secure-status = "okay";

We should be explicit.

In HKG when we discussed this, 'status = "secure"' was the proposal.
That would be simpler:

S world can use "okay" or "secure"
NS world can use "okay" or no property.

That leaves out the case of disabled in S and enabled for NS. We could
want that for s/w reasons, but can we have h/w like that?
