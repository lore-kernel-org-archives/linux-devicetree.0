OK, so the charge pump frequency varies with sampling rate. Well, I guess
that's fine to provide a raw register value then. The name is still a bit
misleading, though.

Maybe calling it cirrus,chgfreq-divisor would be better instead? Also the
description in binding documentation should explicitly state that it's the
raw value that needs to be written to the CHGFREQ register.

OK. After looking at the datasheet for a bit, I'm pretty much convinced
that these two properties should be rather represented as mixer controls
instead, for the purpose of channel mixing.

Whether the "Mic X Sel" control would be present in the mixer or not would
be implied by mic-X-differential property in DT.
