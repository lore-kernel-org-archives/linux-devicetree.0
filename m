This is more a sign of poor quality of implementation than anything
else, and obviously the fact that DT is supposed to be an ABI makes it
much more important to get things right.

There's also a bunch of problems in ondemand, it really doesn't cope
terribly well if you actually tell it what the latencies are for most
systems as it becomes absurdly conservative about not ramping.

This doesn't sound like a recipie for success..

Yes.  I'd go with _tol rather than _tolerance probably but something
like that, yes.
