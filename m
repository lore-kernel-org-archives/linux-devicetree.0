The usual reason would be to bring things into sync.

Is this limitation when the other block is in use a physical limitation
or is it just a case of not seeing the use case.

If the clocking is more complex that seems like even more reason to not
fix this in the binding, and possibly to do as I think I suggested
earlier and use the common clock bindings to manage this rather than
doing something custom and driver specific.
