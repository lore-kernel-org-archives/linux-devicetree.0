Looking at how pm_clk_notify() in clock_ops.c uses con_id[] list, right 
now pm_runtime() will work only for clocks which have con_id (from the 
list above) mentioned in DT. Since clk_find() mandates con_id match when 
its available, NULL con_id does not match.

For simple devices like DaVinci which uses just one clock for power 
management per device (multiple devices might share a clock, but not 
other way around as far as I recall, anyway I will double check this 
assertion), the attached patch should make EMAC work.

That still leaves why lcdc does not work. One difference is it uses 
PSC1. Are there other devices in PSC1 which work (just to rule out any 
thing wrong with PSC1 handling).

Thanks,
Sekhar
