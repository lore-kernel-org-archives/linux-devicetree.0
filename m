That's the best news I've heard this week!
Hope Jonathan gets well and lives happily ever after.

More of Jon's (great) work ;-)
Will definitely read these articles carefully.

I'm coming up empty.
AFAICT, it's unrelated to the _put_user* family of functions.
I see that it has something to do with ref count decrement.

Something about kref.
https://lwn.net/Articles/336224/

They mention "put" but not *why* it's called "put".
Is it related to Dijkstra's P and V for semaphores?
https://cs.nyu.edu/~yap/classes/os/resources/origin_of_PV.html
Still confused...
