Ok, I had a look around to figure out how others handle this, and e.g.
gpio has (ugly) macros (VALIDATE_DESC) to handle this. I guess you are
right and I'm wrong. So, please keep all the if (!mux) checks.

Thanks for insisting!

Yes, you indeed need to check for -EINVAL to catch that. No argument
about that.

I was thinking about the case where mux-control-names names *other* muxes
but not the one asked for in this call. That's not broken and should be
handled. The way I read it, you get -ENODATA in that case?

What I mean is that if you have passed a mux_name and the index of that
name was indeed found in the of_property_match_string call, then any
failure from of_parse_phandle_with_args indicates a bad DT and should
IMO result in an error. I.e., when evaluating the result from
of_parse_phandle_with_args, you should account for the optional param
if and only if mux_name is NULL.

You can do that by e.g. setting optional to false after looking up the
mux_name index (because at that point the mux is no longer considered
optional). E.g. as the last statement in the if (!mux_name) block.
