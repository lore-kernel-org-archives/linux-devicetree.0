Looking at a quick output of:

	grep -r -A10 early_devices[[] arch/sh/kernel/

it looks like all of the existing early platform devices are serial
ports, clocks, and clocksources. The switch to device tree should pick
them all up from CLK_OF_DECLARE, TIMER_OF_DECLARE, and
EARLYCON_DECLARE. Until that's complete, the existing code works
as-is. I don't see what problem you're trying to solve.

FYI I'm (sometimes-somewhat-absent) arch/sh co-maintainer.
