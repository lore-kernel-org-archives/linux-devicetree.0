Right.
I will not add .irq_{enable/disable} to keep the benefit of lazy masking.

Right. I noticed irq_eoi is mandatory when I tested my driver.

I notice handle_percpu_irq() and handle_percpu_devid_irq()
check the NULL pointer dereference like

        if (chip->irq_eoi)
                chip->irq_eoi(&desc->irq_data);

But, other flow handlers do not this.

I see.

I hope all drivers will be converted and irq_domain_add_hierarchy() will be
deleted.

Having many variants with slight difference is confusing to driver developers.
