Actually, the goal with that commit was to prevent potential problems
due to the increased pressure on late_initcall, as suggested by
Grygorii Strashko, but I haven't found yet any evidence of it being
needed, and in my testing the series boot all boards in kernelci with
or without this commit. So I would just not commit it for now and only
consider applying it later if someone reports a problem.

Done.

Done.
