Could you elaborate on the chaining case? I haven't encountered that,
and at the moment I'm not sure I follow how that works.

I guess that might work for the boot-time overlay case, where the user
knows ahead-of-time that there will be a conflict for resources, but
that doesn't help with the dynamic overlay case, since the user can't
know what conflicts there will be.

Can we attempt to unregister the clock device in that case, when the PWM
is requested? If the timekeeping core can select another device, then
we're free to use this one as a PWM. If not, then we're stuck anyway.

Thanks,
Mark.
