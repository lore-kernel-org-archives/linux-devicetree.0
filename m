I was always partial to the regulator style of blahblah-supply but
Grant's suggestion is much cleaner with respect to the rest of the clock
binding.

I guess it will be a bit ugly if a very long array is needed with a
sparse attribute. E.g. 20 clocks specified in the 'clocks' property and
only a single clock needs to have its parent or rate specified.

Is there a reason not to support both methods?
