I'm not going to go get your ack for something as trivial as this. We
do make sure subplatform maintainers are in the loop and get to review
code that touches their platform, but in this case this was a shared
makefile and there were no functional changes.

No, it doesn't. All entries in these files should be sorted
alphabetically. Sometimes we miss out on it, but it's the goal.

If you sort chronologically it's impossible for anyone but people
intimately familiar with UniPhier's product history to add any new
entries in the right location. Also, since it's likely that newer
chips will be introduced over time, new entries are likely to just be
appends instead of inserted at more varied locations in the files.

Append-only additions are more likely to have add/add conflicts, which
is why we're preferring alphabetical sort order in the first place.
