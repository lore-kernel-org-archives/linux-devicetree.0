Yeah, good questions.

I think it can be argued either way.  For review having the complete
context is important.

But from a maintainer's standpoint, when there is any ambiguity
whatsoever about what patches go into this tree or that, it is really
frowned upon and is quite error prone.

Also, that header posting is _SO_ important.  It explains the series.
But for these 'partial apply' situations the header posting refers
to patches not in the series.

This looks terrible in the logs, when, as I do, the header posting
text is added to a marge commit for the series.  People will read it
and say "where are all of these other changes mentioned in the text?
was this series misapplied?"

That's why, maybe after the review is successful, I want the actual
patch series standalone with appropriately updated header posting
text.
