Ok, so I was really off. Sorry.
Now I think I understand the full complexity of the problem.

Ok, looks much better indeed.
I had one case where accelerometers could be on either i2c1 or i2c5.
Do you think this could be handled as well, or this makes things much
more complicated to fit in the i2c driver?

Ok, now that I understand the scope of your needs.
I agree with you, this needs a (close to) turing complete language.
I'm still not really happy about doing it in a driver, but I agree the
full scope you need is scarce enough.
Assuming this is done in a driver, there would need to be some
plumbing between i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match, device's probe
function and your driver, so that your driver only does the various
if/cases and DT changes, but there is no actual device communication
done in that driver.

Right, I agree with you.

That's not currently the case, but can't we assume it will become easy
for users to install a DT overlay?
This would drop all your needs of module parameters, and would
actually be more modulable than your current scheme.
It is a more longer term thought, and could instead apply to further
boards having the same sort of troubles as you, rather than for this
first driver.
