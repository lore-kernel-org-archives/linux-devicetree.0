I think you're mistaken. sun4i-codec has nothing to do with the I2S
driver. It's a driver for the (poorly named) Allwinner's Audio Codec
which features it's own DAI and Codec directly into the SoC.

The DAI being different from the I2S one.

However, we want to use any codec driver with the i2s driver,
including those in sound/soc/codecs, and we already have drivers for
them.

So I'm not sure either solution is a good one. Why not just make the
HDMI part a codec itself, and use the i2s driver as the CPU DAI, like
any other codec?
