Hi all,

This is a series trying to make the "hack" of dedicating a pll (npll)
on these chromebooks to one of the VOPs (that is used for HDMI)
more acceptable for upstream.
Notably it should change nothing for non-chromebook rk3288 designs,
and allows enough configurability that such designs could later
use this feature for either VOP if it is desirable.

I expect the first patch to be acceptable (atleast almost) as-is.
It just adds the PLL frequencies used for HDMI into the PLL configuration
list, so they're ready to be used for hdmi whether by fixed configuration,
automagic magicness or dedicating a PLL.

For the device tree bindings, I added a binding for the list of 
allowed hdmi frequencies (that quite closely a hardware property both
due to EMI/RF considerations and clock/PLL configuration...) as
"rockchip,hdmi-rates-hz" but i think this could have a common name.
Suggestions?

This has been tested on my ASUS C201, and effectively gives
the same display compatibility as ChromeOS has. (This journey
started with me plugging in my 1920x1200 samsung 2443BW and
getting 1280x1024 at 55.555... Hz.)
