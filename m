Most importantly, it's following an existing spec for ibm,associativity,
which defines topology in terms of associativity, not a hierarchical tree.

- It doesn't work for cpu-less nodes.
- It fails if you have multiple paths between two devices, rather than
  a strict tree.
- It doesn't (yet) have a way to define which levels are relevant to NUMA
  topology.
- the phandle references are done in the wrong way if you want to
  represent a lot of devices.

It's very unfortunate that we have two conflicting bindings that are
established. I still think that the associativity binding is more
flexible, but we could try to extend the arm topology binding if
necessary, but I'm not sure the end result of that would be better.
