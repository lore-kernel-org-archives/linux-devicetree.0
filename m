Thanks for reviewing. Just like Daniel said, we need to figure out the
right method for this. So suggestions are very welcome!

Thanks for sharing pointers. It's shame that the copying is not
correct for Hikey960 :)

Come back to recommended state id, I reviewed Juno board defintion and
I found it's not align with PSCI spec defintion, in ARM-TF Juno code
defines state as below [1]:

#define ARM_LOCAL_STATE_RUN     0
#define ARM_LOCAL_STATE_RET     1
#define ARM_LOCAL_STATE_OFF     2

In PSCI spec chapter "6.5 Recommended StateID Encoding" recommends power
state id as below:

0: Run
1: Standby
2: Retention
3: Powerdown

So could you confirm on Hikey960 we should follow PSCI definition for
state id definition?

If completely compliant with PSCI recommended state id, we need change
both for ARM-TF and kernel for this. In ARM-TF, I have sent PR [2].

For the kernel patch, we should change state id as below. Please let me
know if you have suggestion for this.
