Allow access to QEMU firmware blobs, passed into the guest VM via
the fw_cfg device, through SysFS entries. Blob meta-data (e.g. name,
size, and fw_cfg key), as well as the raw binary blob data may be
accessed.

The SysFS access location is /sys/firmware/qemu_fw_cfg/... and was
selected based on overall similarity to the type of information
exposed under /sys/firmware/dmi/entries/...

This functionality is primarily intended to serve as a host->guest
configuration data transfer mechanism that is both:

	- asynchronous: the host doesn't need to wait for the guest
			to be ready to accept data (e.g., by starting
			an agent daemon)

	- out-of-band:  there is no need to commandeer a guest element
			normally visible and available to the guest user
			(e.g., kernel cmdline, mounting floppy/cdrom, etc.)

QEMU now allows arbitrary fw_cfg blobs to be added via the command line,
so it would be nice to make them easy to retrieve from within the guest
OS, and the niceset and easiest way I can think of is

	cat /sys/firmware/qemu-fw-cfg/.../<some-blob-name>/raw

New since v6:

	- added architecture-specific default values for fw_cfg register
	  offsets: DT and/or ACPI will only give us the base address and
	  total size of the fw_cfg register set, but not individual register
	  offsets *within* this total extent. The specific offsets are
	  different across architectures, and this version adds #defines
	  so that reasonable defaults can be used on each supported platform.

Thanks,
  --Gabriel
