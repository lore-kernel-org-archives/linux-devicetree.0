AFAIK, SPDIF is always a single pin connection so only one pin needs to 
be selected. But i2s need for pins for full 8 channel output.

If you want to go closer to the original paradigm, then how about 
defining following audio-port-names: i2s0, i2s1, i2s2, i2s3, and spdif. 
With this approach we could go with your original binding with only 
minor changes. A binding in your stereo i2s or spdif case would look 
like this:

	audio-ports = <0x04>, <0x03>;
	audio-port-names = "spdif", "i2s0";

A full 8 channel i2s or spdif output would look like this:

	audio-ports = <0x04>, <0x03>, <0x02>, <0x01>, <0x00>;
	audio-port-names = "spdif", "i2s0", "i2s1", "i2s2", "i2s3";


This would also indicate the channel mapping to the audio pins (i2s0 for 
first two channels, i2s1 for 3-4, etc.)

The code could for now just look for "i2s0" and the port names for 
channels 3-8 could be ignored until they are needed.

Jyri
