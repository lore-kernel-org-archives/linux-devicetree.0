The GPIO hog functionality can race with driver probe. Based on probe
order, you may have a situation where VPIF probes before tca6416 so we
have an erroneous situation where probe is successful, but hardware is
not really available.

Using enable-gpios lets you handle probe deferral so VPIF capture probe
completes only when hardware is ready. So if for some reason tca6416
driver or hardware is misbehaving, VPIF will know about it through some
error value rather than just assuming that everything went well.

So, yes, in the "all goes well" scenario, there is not much difference
in the two approaches. But the difference will be apparent when
something goes wrong.

Probe order will also influence the shutdown and suspend order. So
kernel will automatically make sure that shutdown happens in reverse
probe order. This may or may not matter in this case. But in  general,
it will be nice to make sure VPIF shuts down before tca6416 does so that
hardware is available for VPIF to cleanly shutdown (and not disconnected
behind its back because tca6416 decided to put all its lines to off as
part of its shutdown).

I think GPIO hog should only be used for pins which are really "system
level". IOW, not related to any driver functionality.
