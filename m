I forgot few points. First, I did all Quad SPI tests using the Atmel QS=
PI
controller and driver.

I did no Dual SPI protocol test yet, only Quad SPI.

I'm able to test neither Quad nor Dual SPI protocols with the Atmel QSP=
I
protocol + m25p80 driver: this driver is not really suited for handling
the Atmel QSPI controller in its Serial Memory Mode.

However I did some non regression tests with the m25p80 driver used on =
the
regular Atmel SPI controller and driver (drivers/spi/spi-atmel.c) to
access a at25df312a memory (SPI 1-1-1 protocol).


Nonetheless the m25p80 driver was taken into account when I wrote the s=
eries.
Indeed Micron, Macronix and Spansion's datasheets provide tables giving=
 the
number of dummy cycles to use depending on both the SPI bus clock
frequency and the Fast Read command. Hence in spi-nor.c, patch 2 sets
nor->read_dummy to the relevant number of dummy cycles (not bits).

Taking Spansion memories as an example, for their factory default Laten=
cy
Code value of 0, they expect:
- 8 dummy cycles for Fast Read 1-1-1 (0x0b / 0x0c)
- 8 dummy cycles for Fast Read 1-1-2 (0x3b / 0x3c)
- 8 dummy cycles for Fast Read 1-1-4 (0x6b / 0x6c)

=46ast Read 1-2-2 and 1-4-4 are not used with Spansion memories since t=
he
number of dummy cycles to be used with one of these op codes is not sui=
ted
for the m25p80 driver.

=46or Micron and Macronix, except when their Quad SPI mode is enabled, =
the
=46ast Read 1-1-4 or Fast Read 1-1-2 commands are preferred to the
=46ast Read 1-4-4 or Fast Read 1-2-2 commands. The number of dummy cycl=
es is
set to 0 for Read command (0x03) and 8 for other Fast Read commands sin=
ce
this setting update can be done safely writing into volatile bits insid=
e
configuration registers. A multiple of 8 dummy cycles is suited for the
m25p80_read() implementation.

Then looking at the m25p80 driver, the original (unchanged) cycles/byte=
s
conversion from the m25p80_read() hook only works with SPI 1-1-x protoc=
ols:

 	/* convert the dummy cycles to the number of bytes */
 	dummy /=3D 8;

As a matter of fact, 8 dummy cycles stand for:
-  8 bits (1 byte ) for SPI 1-1-z protocols
- 16 bits (2 bytes) for SPI x-2-z protocols
- 32 bits (4 bytes) for SPI x-4-z protocols

So I should also fix the above conversion in patch 3 to cover more SPI
protocols.

Cyrille
