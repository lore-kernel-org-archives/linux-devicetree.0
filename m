Makes sense, we could get rid of sb->name storage too.

I agree, That is possible!
We should probably flush the workqueue before we start removing the clients.

yes, Some of the devices need to be powered up before they become 
usable, so probe is used to do the initial power up of the device.

So you are suggesting that we make slim_driver remove not return anything?

In some of the previous discussions with Vinod, it was suggested that 
slim_register_controller should not create an additional device here, 
which is redundant to the actual controller device itself.

So this name would actually come from the controller driver in next 
version of patches.

If this function is called for an existing device with logical address, 
it would give the same logical address, if it finds a vaild one in the 
table.
Other case is when it does not find a valid on then a new address is 
assigned depending on the valid flag passed to the function.
This case is more to do with the Qualcomm B family Slim controller, 
where linux side can not assign logical address, As DSP would only be 
able to assign this address.

If we find a vaild an matching entry in the list, we assume that the 
slim device is already aware of this laddr.

The reason probe is called earlier because the slim device needs 
power-up or reset sequence to make it discoverable on the bus.

I don't think e_addr and sb->eaddr should be different in this case.

In usecase like B family Qualcomm SOCs, where linux cannot assign 
logical address, It needs to get logical address from ADSP and then use 
that. Current model of get_logical_addr provides abstraction so that 
this ADSP communication to get logical addr is hidden from client.

Agreed, will address this in next version.

lenght of addrt might be more than active devices as some of the entries 
in addrt are not valid after the device goes down.

I will give it a go and see how it fits with every thing around it.
