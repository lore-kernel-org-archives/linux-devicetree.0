However, this binding is not merged yet and Stephen have requesting a
complete redesign of the binding as well as the code. So that has to
be concluded first, I presume.


Separate of that, as it's highly likely that everyone will follow the
pcb design guidelines for apq8064 the vin-supplies should be okay to
specify at this level (and not in all board files). Perhaps also the
switching frequencies for the SMPSs?
