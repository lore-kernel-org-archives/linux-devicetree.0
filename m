Thanks for the clarifying.

How about using usb_gadget_vbus_connect/disconnect, which are used in 
many files under drivers/usb/phy.
There is no vbus_session in dwc2/gadget.c, I thought it would be same as 
pullup.

However, usb_gadget_vbus_connect still need para gadget, where should we 
put this file, drivers/usb/phy or drivers/phy

I think there is no need to use extcon, gpio is clear enough.
extcon-gpio.c even do not support dt.

Not all gpio.c support set_debounce, including gpio-pl061.c.

Here the debounce added only for safety.
gpio_id may mis-report when unplug usb, but it is correct for plug usb & 
otg device.
So debounce can be omitted.
If you think using delayed work for debounce is ugly, it is fine switch 
to threaded_irq.

Thanks
