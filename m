This patch series is a collection of patches we have been carrying for a
while.

It includes a few sensor register fixes which would cause visual
artifacts at lower resolution and also at 720p.

Also on some board the 'powerdown' and /or 'reset' pins are not tied so
we need to add support for optional gpios to handle these.

Since these camera are removable on some board we also need the driver
to actually fail when there is no hardware present so the driver is
actually removed.

Finally, we update the licensing statement to use SPDX licensing.

Changes since v1:
- Addressed review comment from Prabhakar
- Added support for reset-gpios
- Rework the power setting to use pm_runtime instead of s_power
  as based on discussion with Sakari it would be the prefered method
- Added a patch to reduce the number explicit include files to the
  minimum necessary instead of the previous kitchen sink approach
