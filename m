Andrew,

Thanks for the hint on the compatibility. I wonder if
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/dsa/marvell.txt should have some
notes added about switch device compatibility? It wasn't clear to me
that these would be compatible.

What is the convention, if any, of the naming of the 'lan' ports (0
based vs 1 based, eth vs lan)? Is it strictly up to the board vendor?
The board I'm supporting has a silkscreen that shows 'Port 1' through
'Port 4' so I was leaning towards 1 based.

Thanks,

Tim
