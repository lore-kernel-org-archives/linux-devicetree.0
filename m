Exactly, I had a chat with Suzuki. One option is to introduce new hwid
field to fix that. If the field is present, it will be used and reg
field will be ignored. In that way, you won't break the compatibility.
Just my thoughts. I am not sure if we need to support old kernel with
updated DTs though. That may be difficult.

True, they can pick up the new changes too along with changes just
fixing the warning.

But the problem is if someone has DT which can't be modified and we move
to new scheme only in the kernel, then they will see regression on their
platforms. If that's fine, it simplifies things a lot. But I am not so
sure of that ...
