We need to have generic support for INTA within the NAVSS for Linux. The
UDMA (also part of the NAVSS) is used as system DMA and for the
DMAengine driver we need to have ability to handle the events from Rings
and from the UDMA itself.

Option 2 is not really an option as other components need to configure
INTA to get interrupts from the Events flying within NAVSS.

In the past with Keystone II we did have similar PacketDMA engine but it
was dedicated to service networking and crypto. For all other
peripherals we had EDMA as generic system DMA.

With AM654 this is no longer the case as we no longer have EDMA and the
NAVSS is tasked to service all peripherals, like networking and the ones
we used to use EDMA.
