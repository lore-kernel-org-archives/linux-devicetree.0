Will rename it as IPQ4019

Since this is for the emulation platform, we don't have the bootloader.

Cannot drop this. This is the ref-clock frequency. For the
chip it is 48MHz, for emulation is ~20MHz. Similar to
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom-msm8974.dtsi#n89

Yes, will get updated in subsequent patches.
