Depends on what I can get my hands on / what is in the post atm.

One difference in fex files of different 18 variants is how the usb wifi is
powered, either via a gpio or via ldo3. Also there are differences in which
accelerometer is used, so eventually I expect there to be several users
of this dtsi.

I've bought several second hand q8 formfactor tablets on the internet lately,
when they arrive and I get around to work on them a second user may show
up soon.

Regards,

Hans
