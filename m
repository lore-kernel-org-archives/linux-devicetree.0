Good question. I'd meant to figure something out for this placeholder.
The default would be GPL-2 inheriting from the old doc. My preference
would be to dual license these with BSD as they're not just kernel
files, but I don't really want to track down copyright holders (also
not explicitly declared) to do that.

The '|'  means a literal block. The '+' is a block chomping indicator:

http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2794534

This was all converted using my doc2yaml script and ruamel.yaml
decided it needed the '+'. I'm not sure exactly why. It may be based
on how many trailing newlines the text had.

In this case, this isn't really useful and we should just remove
description unless you want to add something.

'...' is the end of YAML document marker.

'-' means a list item (a YAML/JSON list, not to be confused with
'items' the json-schema keyword). Actions uses 'oneOf' (which is a
list of schemas) because there are multiple SoCs.

And also 'items' itself can be a list or dict, but we restrict it to
lists for the DT meta-schema.

Good point.

One option is always use 'oneOf' even if just 1 item. The problem is
that the use of oneOf/allOf/anyOf makes the error reporting pretty
vague.

Another option is to make each SoC a separate schema which could be
either separate docs or multiple yaml docs within a file. The downside
is just repeating all the top-level properties.

I kept those as comments when there was meaningful information. I did
not feel that "MeLE V9" as a description of "mele,v9" added any value.
If you want to add 'model' schema that would be better than having
just comments, but I'm not going to find all the values of model which
aren't documented.
