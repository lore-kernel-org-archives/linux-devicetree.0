Sure it'd be great if it could be in v4.10.
Fixes: b32e700256bc ("ARM: dts: imx: add Boundary Devices Nitrogen6_Max board")

As for stable kernel, I guess it wouldn't hurt but it's not mandatory in
my opinion.

Do you want me to re-send with the Fixes line? What about the SOM2
patch, should it include a Fixes line although it works thanks to
U-Boot?

Thanks,
Gary
