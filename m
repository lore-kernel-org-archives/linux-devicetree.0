SLIMbus component contain two or more SLIMbus devices,
like function(Generic) device, interface device.
Interface device provides bus management services, where as generic 
device provides more of application specific functionality like ADC/DAC..

Its not really a read-modify-write,
REQUEST_CHANGE_VALUE/REQUEST_CLEAR_INFORMATION commands are part of 
SLIMbus Spec.
We need provide write value + buffer for read value to store.

all REQUEST_CHANGE_VALUE cmd do is this in single operation:

1> save the old value
2> update new value from wbuf
3> return the saved value from step 1, into rbuf

Not sure what is the real usecase for this, I have not seen its usage in 
any Qualcomm downstream code.

May be it can be used to implement some class of atomic ops.
