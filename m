Rob, Russell,

the main reason why dove clocks are the way they are is that back
when we thought of the bindings for mvebu SoC clocks, CCF and DT was
in its very beginning. Looking back, some decisions shouldn't have
been made that way. Also, we tried to describe Dove and the other SoCs
similarily, but Dove is always a little odd.

>From todays point of view, I certainly agree with Russell that all
PMU related stuff is best kept in a single PMU node.

Thanks for providing the patches, I appreciate the extra work of
separating those from your working trees.
