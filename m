None necessary, I just pushed the logic further on my own as specified
in the changelog. I can add the partitions back as I don't have any
strong preference on this, but not without mentioning that it is because
that is what the LCDK ships with, as in my original version, please see
if the adjustments below accomodate your preferences.

I'd add [1]:
Same doc reads for ROM "Silicon Revision 2.1", "Updated NAND boot mode
to offer boot from block 0 or block 1", (Sekhar:) "but needs new boot pin
settings not possible in stock LCDK".

If you want me to keep the partitions, I would change that to [2] "Here
we keep the first two provisioned default partitions and labels the LCDK
ships with as is." (although FWIU it conflicts with your request above).
