More to it, AFAIK the list of HW irqs in the PCI host bridge controller
"interrupts" property is not necessarily a sequential list of numbers
either.

If I understand how these bindings/code works, the PCI INTX legacy IRQs
are mapped to IRQ lines {0,1,2,3} of the PCI host bridge interrupt
controller through the "interrupt-map" property.

Those IRQ lines are cascaded to the GIC through the HW irq in the
PCI host controller "interrupts" property:

IRQ line 0 <-> first cell of "interrupts" property
IRQ line 1 <-> second cell of "interrupts" property

and so forth.

I am not sure there is anything formal defining this behaviour other
than implicit expectactions.

@Murali: can you clarify please ?
