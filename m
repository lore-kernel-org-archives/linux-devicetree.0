It would probably make sense to Cc the documentation maintainers/mailing
list on this patch (AFAICS, you didn't do that).

When do you plan to add slimbus to Documentation/driver-api/index.rst?

> +Clock-pause is exited by waking up framer device (if controller driver i=

> +The header file <linux/slimbus.h> has more documentation about messaging=
 APIs.

Once the kerneldoc documentation (i.e. the /** ... */ comments in the
source) is included somewhere, I think it would make sense to make
slim_ctrl_buf a clickable link to the struct's documentation.
