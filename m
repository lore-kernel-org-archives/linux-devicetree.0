Is this related to the standard ARM SCU that manages multiprocessor
systems, or a different unit that uses the same name?

Since this is a global register range with a variety of things in it,
the best candidate IMHO would be to use the "syscon" driver. You can
mark the device node as 'compatible="apm,xgene-scu","syscon"' to let
it get picked up by the drivers/mfd/syscon driver, which creates
a "regmap" structure for it.

The reset driver then uses a DT reference with a phandle to the
SCU node and calls syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle() to get the
regmap. It can get the register number inside the regmap from DT
as well and use the regmap API to perform the reset.
