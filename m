You typically only have a frequency property for fixed clocks.

However, we should think about how to set frequency for programmable
clocks. Perhaps this is just making clock-frequency an array of
values in the same order as the outputs.

Whether you decide to implement a blob or every single mux, divider, and
gate is independent from whether you use generic clock code or not. You
could simply define a clock controller node with lots of outputs yet
still use generic code to implement clock support in Linux. The reality
is you will probably have a mixture of generic and SOC-specific clocks.

What is our goal here? I'm skeptical we will ever get to the point that
we can fully describe the clock tree for a new SOC without any code
changes. Perhaps our goal is simply that clock differences across all
boards for an SOC can be described in DT.
