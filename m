Hi,

I haven't taken a look at all your changes yet, but I'll get this
comment off my chest while it's still fresh :)

I think that's the way to go, in general. We can get by with
"implementation defined behavior" (i.e., make the driver do what makes
sense) for now, but to avoid breakage in the future, the bootloader
needs to specify what ECC configuration is required -- via DT. But your
current patch is still probably fine without it, since you're supporting
new hardware.

If ECC is purely determined by the chunk size, then why not just:

  marvell,nand-chunk-size = 2048;
  (with a value of 2048, 1024, or 512?)
