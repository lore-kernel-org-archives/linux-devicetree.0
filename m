There are only a few pins that are GPOs - from 
marvell,kirkwood-pinctrl.txt, they are 
1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 18, 19 and 33.

The stock Marvell bootloader is a little broken as it passes the kernel
the _source_ address of the initrd rather than the _load_ address.
Thus the bootloader passes the address 0xf8280040 rather than the address
0x00800040.

It appears the initrd address in the devicetree structure (which is 
filled in from what is passed by the bootloader when 
CONFIG_ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT is set) is processed _after_ the address in 
the initrd= kernel parameter is processed.

Rather than putting the initrd address into the DTS, it would probably be
better to have the person compiling the kernel configure it with e.g.:

CONFIG_CMDLINE="initrd=0x00800040,0x0013FFC0 earlyprintk panic=5"
CONFIG_CMDLINE_EXTEND=y
CONFIG_ARM_APPENDED_DTB=y
CONFIG_ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT=n
