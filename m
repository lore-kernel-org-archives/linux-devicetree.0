That company is undergoing a lot of change now, I think anything is
possible: They might decide that ARM is a really bad idea (after
the Windows-RT fiasco), they could start working together with us
on these problems, or they could do everything in their hands to
make our lives as hard as they can (as before, see
http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=2010011422570951).

Agreed. I'm not sure who "we" is in this, but I assume you mean the wider
ARM Linux developer community.  Linaro already has full-time developers
working on this, with ties into the UEFI and ACPI standard bodies, and that
is good. Still it does not mean we should prematurely merge any of the
code coming out of it, until there are products out there with ACPI firmware
that is not completely messed up and that is worth supporting in mainline,
considering the maintainance effort.

I would go further and reject any code that adds an SoC or BIOS vendor
specific glue layer. The bar we have set with the current ARM64 code
and for new ARM32 is that everything is in device drivers of some sort.
I would hate to reintroduce platform directories just because every
company has a different understanding of how to describe the same things
in ACPI, or because ACPI-5.0 is insufficient to describe the SoC and
go back to static platform devices.

I'm skeptical about getting AML working on DT nodes, just as I doubt that
AML is sufficient to do what people want when faced with a complex SoC.

Also, if AML ends up being mainly used as a trampoline to get into EL2/EL3
firmware, I'd much rather standardize the actual firmware interfaces
underneath.

I think that depends on how whether you expect ACPI to succeed in the market
or not. If it ends up being a historic sidenote, that's what the code
should be.
A precedent for this would be mach-shark, which we just removed. It
was one of the original StrongARM machines and actually came with Open
Firmware and a DT that was (rightfully so) converted to ATAGS format
on boot.

I guess if it grows too big, it could be moved into a separate boot loader
project and out of the kernel, as we do for the ATAGS-to-DT conversion
with the impedence-matcher.

I mostly agree, but I think that the decision whether to ignore, translate
or implement support for ACPI BIOS implementations depends a lot on
what kinds of systems we are going to see and the level of sophistication
they put into their firmware.

If we are basically talking about PCs with their x86 CPU removed and
an ARM chip put in there, I think an ACPI implementation would be
harmless enough. However if we are talking about complex SoCs that just
have the same information in ACPI that we have in DT in a different
format, we really need to tell the responsible developers that ACPI
support for these just won't get merged.
