Ok. I get your point.

Interesting. I wasn't aware of "actively using". Sure, there's MacOS-X-ppc,
IBM AIX, Oracle Solaris.... and I just discovered that Free-/OpenBSD also use
them.

Why not? How complex could it be in order to not be able to describe it in a
Device-Tree in some OS-agnostic way?

Ok. That was my original plan... it just occurred to me that describing the
audio fabric in OF-DT would be a better idea :-(

Good idea.... but where should such a repository be hosted?

Thanks for pointing out. I suspected that already, but since everyone seems to
just go ahead and write his own piece of fabric-code, I started wondering
about the reason. I wouldn't consider a second about just blindfolded
duplicating what several others already did before me without seriously
thinking about a universal "fits almost all" solution instead. And I still
refuse to just copy-cat audio fabric code for our board!
