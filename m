Your whole error reporting is done roughly through the same registers,
as Arnd pointed out. Why can't you build your single driver around that
and based on the error type being reported, multiplex inside a *single*
interrupt handler to the proper decoding routines.

And all of those are separate IP blocks and they can be integrated with
other, non APM hardware, or do those things all belong together? IOW,
can we expect such IP blocks to appear in other hw platforms or are
they all custom APM design which need to go together due to proprietary
coherency protocol or whatever, for example?

Sounds like all is useful.
