On my platform, _STAT register only carries the command code but
actual data is exchanged via SharedMemory/SHM. Now we need to know
when the sent data packet (in SHM) has been consumed by the remote -
for which our protocol mandates the remote clear the TX_STAT register.
And vice-versa for RX.

 Some other f/w may choose some other mechanism for TX-Done - say some
ACK bit set or even some time bound guarantee.

My f/w expects the RX_STAT cleared after reading data from SHM. Where
do you think is the right place to clear RX_STAT?

I have said many times in many threads... its the mailbox controller
_and_ the remote f/w that should be seen as one entity. It may not be
possible to write a controller driver that works with any remote
firmware.

If remote has its own latency, that does not mean we add some more :)
