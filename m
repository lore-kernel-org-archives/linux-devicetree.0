I believe it is a VGA signal from the host, but the Aspeed Video Engine 
somewhat abstracts that away; not all the signal information that the 
engine is receiving is available to the BMC interface. I did add the 
timing information I could access to the latest patch set. As you say, 
it could be useful for debugging if weird things are happening.

Thanks!
