Dear Jason Gunthorpe,

Thanks for your quick feedback!

Ah, right, I missed this part of the OF specification. Indeed, having
the ddddd bits non-zero was critical here to allow the PCIe driver to
find which MBUS_ID(x, y) to use for a particular PCIe interface.

The problem we were trying to address here is that apparently the fake
MBUS-ID was not seen by Arnd as a correct solution, if we understood
correctly what Arnd said in
http://www.mail-archive.com/devicetree-discuss-uLR06cmDAlY/bJ5BZ2RsiQ@public.gmane.org/msg34650.html:

"""
Using 0xffff0002 as a placeholder for the pcie translation is definitely
better than 0xffff0000 as you had before, but let me ask again in case
you missed it the last time (and sorry if I missed the answer):

Why not just put the actual translation here the way it happens for each
of the PCIe ports? With the definition here, the PCIe driver actually
has no way to figure out what settings the windows need to use!
"""

We're not sure how to handle this comment properly in terms of DT
binding. What the PCIe driver needs is:

 *) One global range of addresses for PCIe memory regions and one global
    range of addresses for PCIe I/O regions. Those were until the v5 of
    this patch set expressed using a fake MBUS_ID(0xf0, 0x02). Those
    are global to all PCIe interfaces.

 *) The target and attribute values for MEM and I/O windows, that are
    per-PCIe interface.

As long as we can get those two informations from the DT, I believe
we're open to all your suggestions on how to encode them.

Thanks!
