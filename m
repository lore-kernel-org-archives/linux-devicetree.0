I can move this defines to include/linux/mfd/wcd9335/wcd9335.h as there 
are no active users for this, but I  was hoping that these can be used 
in DT in future.

WCD9335 is an interrupt controller too. It muxes multiple interrupts via 
a gpio line interrupt.

I did mention this in the bindings.

+- interrupt-controller:
+	Usage: required
+	Definition: Indicating that this is a interrupt controller
+
+- #interrupt-cells:
+	Usage: required
+	Value type: <int>
+	Definition: should be 1
