For most of those bindings the knowledge about which register and bit
position(s) correspond to the handles resides in the driver.

The register layout is very non-uniform for many reset controllers. Some
share the same register space with some of those clock controllers.

I can't argue that the behavior is non-uniform for the sane reset
controllers though, most of them have just a single bit, for most
of them all reset lines behave the same.

Yes. From what has been shown so far, it seems that in this case, while
the resets are distributed sparsely, the relative layout (set/clear
registers right next to each other) is uniform.

Indeed I would prefer the driver to carry the register layout tables
instead of putting this information into the device tree at all.

I recognize I am biased here. So feel free to ignore this point.

What I'd like to make sure is that we have thought about and are happy
to spread (partial) information about the reset controller register
layout throughout the device tree like this.
