Hi,

I haven't given this a thorough review, but I spotted a couple of items
below.

Is the PMU any different in the MP and !MP variants? The code doesn't
seem to handle the two any differently and will pass either to userspace
as "armv7_scorpion".

If there is some difference that we don't handle right now, that's fine,
it just looks a little odd.

These last two entries go against the policy we set in commit
40c390c768f89849: "ARM: perf: don't pretend to support counting of L1I
writes", so I think they should be dropped.

Not ARMV7_PERFCTR_PC_BRANCH_MIS_PRED for the RESULT_MISS cases as with
all other ARMv7 instances (Krait included)?

Thanks,
Mark.
