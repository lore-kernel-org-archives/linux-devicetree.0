Ah, right. Sorry. Will make it optional then.

A brief look at 16x datasheet suggests that the "fast clock" source
circuitry needs to be enabled in the PMU, whereas the internal "32.768"
might not be. Perhaps the timer clk is always enabled in PMU, or the
slow clock is used on those platforms? No idea.

I don't have a MMP2 datasheet, but if things work the same as on a 16x,
then mach-mmp/time.c indeed chooses the fast timer.

The DT MMP2 platform certainly is certainly broken*. Not sure about the
BSP-based platforms.

* in other ways too: even when the missing clock is worked around with
  "clk_ignore_unused" the wrong rate gets chosen and the timer runs too
  slow. (Fix posted recently.)

Should I make an effort to make the driver look up and enable the clock
on MMP2 even if it doesn't find the clock property in DT?

It won't work otherwise, which is why I thought I can't break it
further (I didn't notice that the same binding and driver are used on
PXA168 and PXA910).
