+Hisilicon SoC HiP05/06/07 ARMv8 PMU
+===================================
+
+The Hisilicon SoC chips like HiP05/06/07 etc. consist of various independent
+system device PMUs such as L3 cache (L3C) and Miscellaneous Nodes(MN). These
+PMU devices are independent and have hardware logic to gather statistics and
+performance information.
+
+HiSilicon SoC chip is encapsulated by multiple CPU and IO dies. The CPU die
+is called as Super CPU cluster (SCCL) which includes 16 cpu-cores. Every SCCL
+in HiP05/06/07 chips are further grouped as CPU clusters (CCL) which includes
+4 cpu-cores each.
+e.g. In the case of HiP05/06/07, each SCCL has 1 L3 cache and 1 MN PMU device.
+The L3 cache is further grouped as 4 L3 cache banks in a SCCL.
+
+The Hisilicon SoC PMU DT node bindings for uncore PMU devices are as below.
+For PMU devices like L3 cache. MN etc. which are accessed using the djtag,
+the parent node will be the djtag node of the corresponding CPU die (SCCL).
+
+L3 cache
+---------
+The L3 cache is dedicated for each SCCL. Each SCCL in HiP05/06/07 chips have 4
+L3 cache banks. Each L3 cache bank have separate DT nodes.
+
+Required properties:
+
+	- compatible : This value should be as follows
+		(a) "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v1" for v1 hw in HiP05/06 chips
+		(b) "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v2" for v2 hw in HiP07 chip
+
+	- module-id : This property is a combination of two values in the below order.
+		      a) Module ID: The module identifier for djtag.
+		      b) Instance or Bank ID: This will identify the L3 cache bank
+			 or instance.
+
+Optional properties:
+
+	- interrupt-parent : A phandle indicating which interrupt controller
+		this PMU signals interrupts to.
+
+	- interrupts : Interrupt lines used by this L3 cache bank.
+
+	*The counter overflow IRQ is not supported in v1 hardware (HiP05/06).
+
+Miscellaneous Node
+------------------
+The MN is dedicated for each SCCL and hence there are separate DT nodes for MN
+for each SCCL.
+
+Required properties:
+
+	- compatible : This value should be as follows
+		(a) "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-mn-v1" for v1 hw in HiP05/06 chips
+		(b) "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-mn-v2" for v2 hw in HiP07 chip
+
+	- module-id : Module ID to input for djtag.
+
+Optional properties:
+
+	- interrupt-parent : A phandle indicating which interrupt controller
+		this PMU signals interrupts to.
+
+	- interrupts : Interrupt lines used by this PMU.
+
+	*The counter overflow IRQ is not supported in v1 hardware (HiP05/06).
+
+Example:
+
+	djtag0: djtag@80010000 {
+		compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-djtag-v1";
+		reg = <0x0 0x80010000 0x0 0x10000>;
+		scl-id = <0x02>;
+
+		pmul3c0 {
+			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v1";
+			module-id = <0x04 0x02>;
+		};
+
+		pmul3c1 {
+			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v1";
+			module-id = <0x04 0x04>;
+		};
+
+		pmul3c2 {
+			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v1";
+			module-id = <0x04 0x01>;
+		};
+
+		pmul3c3 {
+			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v1";
+			module-id = <0x04 0x08>;
+		};
+
+		pmumn0 {
+			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-mn-v1";
+			module-id = <0x0b>;
+		};
+	};
