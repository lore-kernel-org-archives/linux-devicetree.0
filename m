Probably yes. It depends on the scale though: if you add more code than
what is needed to convert to the pinctrl framework, we might decide that
it's not worth it.

Note that moving to the pinctrl subsystem can be done independent from
doing the device tree conversion, and it does not depend on the
pinctrl dt binding even if you already have DT support.

Ok, I see.

Right, I was only looking at the stuff that is actually being used in mainline.
However I think this file should not be needed at all -- any contents that
are specific to one driver can just live in that driver, and stuff that is
shared across multiple drivers generally looks like it is also shared between
3xx and 6xx.

There is not all that much that can be shared here:

* clock.c would go into drivers/clk/ for spear13xx and possibly for the others
  too.
* padmux.c would go into drivers/pinctrl
* time.c would go into drivers/clocksource
* shirq.c is potentially shared, but we've discussed in the past about
  creating a new drivers/irqchip where this can live.
* restart.c is very small, there is no harm in duplicating this.
* The header files will have to go elsewhere, too, as we move towards
  have a single multiplatform zImage.

Good idea. As Stefan has shown, it's not really all that hard to get a lot
done for the older platforms, and spear13xx will likely be much harder
because of the increased hardware complexity.

Yes, you can do updates in there that are logical and keep the current
basic structure or improve it. I would only object if you do a more or
less complete rewrite of those files but don't use the common infrastructure
in the process.
