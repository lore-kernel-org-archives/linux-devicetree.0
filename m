Should this have been a [GIT PULL], then?

I was confused by the [PATCH 0/4].

Sending patches is the usual way to have things reviewed. Linking to an
external site doesn't fit with the workflows of everyone.

If you wish to have patches reviewed, please send them as patches in the
usual fashion.

I will note that on the patch you linked, the compatible string is far
too vague, per common conventions. Per your description above, that
should be something like "arm,cryptocell-712-ree" (and each variant
should have its own string).

I don't have documentation to hand to attempt to review the rest.

I would appreciate if you could ensure that the DT binding was reviewed
as part of the staging TODOs. That needs to follow the usual DT review
process of sending patches to the list. Until that has occurred, it
shouldn't be in Documentation/devicetree/.

Thanks,
Mark.
