Ah! I see the source of your confusion.  In this case the parent node
is the root node, and the root node always has offset 0.  I guess this
needs to be better documented, although I'm not immediately sure where.

Yes, that should be fine.  It should also be fine with the new buffer
partially overlapping the existing tree.
