Would be nice indeed, as it's part of their intended purpose.

For now we have to shoehorn things into linux-only stuff (like initrd)
because well, nobody cares enough about NetBSD to compile U-Boot with
its internal API, so let alone adding custom Haiku code.

And of course, for things linux doesn't care about (like framebuffer
description) then we're stuck trying to guess where it's at and writing
drivers for our bootloader.

So if at least people were considering they aren't the only users of
this, that'd make life better for everyone.

The brilliant idea of FDT was that we could have a canonical source and
blob for it where people could send patches, but of course Linux and BSD
freaks disagreed, so you now find Linux-flavoured DTs for rPi and other
things, as well as BSD versions.

Please, at least get the binding documentation for this unique and
usable for everyone!
