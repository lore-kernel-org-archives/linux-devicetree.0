Adam, is networking working for you on the DA850 EVM?

The two clocks prior to these changes was a hack to work around a
limitation of the old lock code (because of the way it used a linked list
each clock could only be used once) so, yes, that should not have anything
to do with it.

I see that there is no clk_prepare_enable() in the mdio driver or the emac
driver. I suppose it expects pm_runtime to take care of this maybe?

You can see if the clock is enabled by running:

     cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary

FWIW, the rmii clock is in the clock init for non-DT da850.
