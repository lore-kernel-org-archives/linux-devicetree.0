okay, will drop it in next version.

Before I jump into the details, I would like to provide a brief on TISCI 
resource management:

- Host_id: Typically it is the representation of the host processing entities 
(example: A53 cores running in a VM) as identified by the TISCI.[1]
- Device_id: Each Device in SoC is uniquely identified by TISCI using an ID.
- Each device has Resources like interrupts, DMA channels etc. A simple example 
would be Interrupt Router and GIC($subject). There are n physical GIC interrupts 
connected to Interrupt Router. Such resources are are uniquely identified by 
TISCI using a type ID.[2]

For the sake of simplicity lets consider an Interrupt Router(IR) to which GIC 
line 32-63 are connected. Considering Isolation for each VM in picture, TISCI 
allows for a certain range within [32-63] to be assigned to a specific Host_ID. 
This is mainly to provide the ability for OSs running in virtual machines to be 
able to independently communicate with the firmware without the need going 
through a hypervisor.

- Now for Linux to know the GIC irq range that can be used by this Interrupt 
router, IR driver should send a message to system-controller using TISCI 
protocol with the resource type as parameter.
- For configuring the IRQ,(i.e. attaching an input to IR to a GIC irq), IR 
driver should send a message to system-controller using TISCI protocol with 
gic-device-id and an irq from the provided range as parameters.

For covering the above two scenarios, ti,sci-dst-id and ti,sci-rm-range-girq is 
introduced in DT.

Sure, will fix it in next version.
