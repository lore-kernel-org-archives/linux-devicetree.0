Hi Rob,

Not always.

And probing the display earlier may result in breaking some other
devices. For example, the display driver may want to enable and then
disable its clock at some point of time in probe(). The enable will
get propagated to parent clocks of display clock as well and all will
have a refcount of 1. Now if display controller disables its clock,
the whole hierarchy of clocks may go down as no one else have taken a
reference of those clocks and other peripherals, used during booting
the kernel, that depend on the clk hierarchy may not work properly
after that until the time their driver comes up.

One more typical problem I saw during my testing on hikey was that
many debug messages were missing during kernel boot (though everything
was available with dmesg later on), that I never noticed earlier on.

After digging a bit I found that it is because of the way AMBA bus
works. It enables and disables the interface clock before calling
probe() (to read some registers) and the interface and functional
clocks were same for hikey UART. And that disabled the clock before
calling probe() which was enabled by the bootloader. And the message
started coming again only after sometime when tty device all setup
properly.

Over that the display driver can be compiled as a module (which we
will disallow with your suggestion). Plus all the resources for the
display driver may not be available early on and so the driver will be
probed later again. And by that time some of the resources may get
disabled/reconfigured.

That would be tricky as well. Same example about refcounting of
clocks. What if the parent clock of display controller's clock gets
disabled, because another child of that parent clock has done a clk
enable/disable? And with amba probing, there are more chances of that
naturally.

My basic idea is that some code should come in and set these
constraints before any of the users of these resources come up (i.e.
display, serial, mmc drivers, etc). That is the only sane way with
which we would be able to have some guarantees here.

As I said, it may be too late.

I am not sure if I fully understood some of your comments. Lets see if
I have :)

Are you saying that we set the same boot constraints (i.e. by calling
the same API as proposed in this patchset) from these generic drivers?
I agree that the driver would know all the details and would be in a
good position to judge all the resources it needs, but again, this may
be too late. And what if we have two drivers which want to come up
first and set these constraints? Like MMC and LCD sharing same
regulator or clk line ?

Sure and that's what we have been doing so far. Hacking different
parts of kernel to force some kind of ordering :)

I am not sure what the problem is and I can't say if that can benefit
from this work. Someone also mentioned (privately) that handing off a
preboot DSP to kernel can also be a usecase for this framework. I am
not sure of the details though :)

Yeah, I am not really targeting those right now. They can have
always-ON kind of hints in DT and that should be all. I am
specifically targeting stuff where a driver takes over eventually.

Maybe, I am not sure.

Why shouldn't we allow the LCD driver to be present as a module? I am
just asking :)

Sure, that's me. I am just holding off from touching MAINTAINERS file
until this stuff is accepted (at least informally).

You don't want this to get merged, do you ? :)

Thanks for your feedback Rob. Really appreciate it.
