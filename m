OK, now the warning makes sense.  I was reading "spaces" to mean
the space character instead of white space.

I don't have a strong opinion either, but downgrading to a CHK
would be nice.

It would be less confusing to me (though awkward sounding) to
change the message to "Multiple whitespaces after return type".
