On closer inspection of the user manual and the SDK code,
there is no reset control for R_PIO in the A23, but there is
still a APB0 gate. Also the register space is still at 0x01f02c00,
the address space for R_PIO.

I know the user manual lists the PL pins under the PIO controller,
however the section doesn't list registers for them. It would seem
they are still separate blocks. Also the kernel code never bothers
to enable the R_PIO clock, possibly because it was enabled by U-boot.
