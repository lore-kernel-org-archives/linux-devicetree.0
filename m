I think this should work as is: the code first looks for devices
that are already there and then registers a notifier for devices
that show up later. This is meant to work for both devices that
are hotplugged at a later point as well as PCI buses that are
already there but not yet probed.

Possible. It may well be that the code is only tested on x86,
which always probes its PCI very early.

Sounds good. Let's focus on getting the driver merged first and
then follow up with a patch to get this right for all PCI hosts.
