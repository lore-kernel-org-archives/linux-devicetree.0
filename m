Yes, as I said I want to have the non controversial stuff in first.
Afterwards, we can submit more controversial patches (per feature).

I mean in U-Boot and Linux (and with "newest U-Boot" I refer to the one
provided by CompuLab; as far as I know there is no upstream U-Boot
support for the Utilite). Although it seems to work "by accident". The
custom CompuLab code fails to put the mac address in the devicetree but
stores it in the correct environment variable such that the upstream
U-Boot magic can take over.

Anyway, are there any U-Boot updates scheduled (by CompuLab)? And is
there a way to contribute/discuss changes?

On the other hand, it will be very hard to change it afterwards. Maybe
someone wants to upstream the U-Boot support and they insist on a
different partition layout (e.g. uboot-failsafe) ...
I never got why people decided to go without a on-device partition table
for most raw flash chips. It is a pity that it has to be hard coded in
the firmware/kernel/whatever.

As I stated before, IMHO using the latest U-Boot is no problem and is
already required (for full support).
