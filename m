I'll re-iterate about the DMA API requirements.  All drivers that perform
DMA are expected to perform DMA mask negotiation with the architecture
code.  That means all drivers should use:

	dma_set_mask()

if they intend to use the streaming DMA APIs,

	dma_set_coherent_mask()

if they intend to use the coherent DMA API, or

	dma_set_mask_and_coherent()

if they intend to use both APIs.  Drivers that omit these calls are
buggy.

It is also required that drivers check the return value from these
calls, since failure means that (eg) they are not allowed to perform
64-bit DMA.

The mask that the driver passes in to these functions is determined
by two things:

(a) how many address lines the device supports
(b) the addressing mode that the driver wishes to enable for the device

For example, on PCI, to use 64-bit DMA, DAC addressing is necessary.
A PCI driver must have successfully negotiated a >32-bit DMA mask in
order to use DAC addressing, as this indicates whether the upstream
supports DAC addressing cycles.

There may be other restrictions that the device driver is unaware of.

So, these three functions are part of a negotiation that drivers are
expected to perform, and moving this information into DT does not
negate the need for drivers to perform this negotiation.

Drivers that use the DMA mask coerce() functions are fundamentally
buggy drivers that either (a) didn't set a DMA mask before there was
code in DT/elsewhere to provide the default mask, or (b) are overriding
the negotiation mechanism.  No new drivers should ever use the DMA mask
coerce functions.

Hope this helps.
