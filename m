Hi Joel,

Sorry for the long delay in updating this thread.
But I just observed one weird behaviour in ftrace-ramoops when I was 
trying to use binary record instead of rendering text for event-ramoops.

Even though we set the ftrace-size in device tree for ramoops, the 
actual ftrace-ramoops record seems to have more records than specified size.
Is this expected or some bug?

Below is the ftrace-ramoops size passed in dtsi for db410c and we can 
see that the ftrace record is more.

# cat /sys/module/ramoops/parameters/ftrace_size
131072
#
# cat /sys/fs/pstore/ftrace-ramoops-0 | wc -c
560888
#
# cat /sys/fs/pstore/ftrace-ramoops-0 | grep CPU:0 | wc -c
137758
#
# cat /sys/fs/pstore/ftrace-ramoops-0 | grep CPU:1 | wc -c
140560
#
# cat /sys/fs/pstore/ftrace-ramoops-0 | grep CPU:2 | wc -c
141174
#
# cat /sys/fs/pstore/ftrace-ramoops-0 | grep CPU:3 | wc -c
141396
#

I don't see this in console or dmesg ramoops and also with the 
event-ramoops which I have posted since we don't use binary record, only 
ftrace-ramoops uses binary record to store trace data.

Also regarding the warning on "event_call->event.funcs->trace()" call,
I see it everytime without spinlock. Also we see output_printk using 
spinlock when making this call. I could not find a way to pass event 
buffer size and allocate in pstore. Steven can give some hints with this 
I guess.

Steven Rostedt gave some reviews about using raw_spinlocks for this call 
earlier in this thread. So is it right to not use spinlocks for trace 
events?

One difference I see in ftrace-ramoops and event-ramoops is that 
ftrace-ramoops  is not started on boot and event-ramoops logging can be 
enabled from boot (late initcall however).

Do let me know if you have any way to avoid this warning which is a race 
I think without spinlock.

Thanks,
Sai
