Hi folks,

This set moves firmware specific implementations of the device / fwnode 
property API to locations that are specific to firmware implementation, 
still leaving property set (which isn't really firmware) implementation in
drivers/base/property.c.

The set depends on the ACPI graph support v5 (10/13 v5.1) patches I posted
a moment ago.

The patches may be found with dependencies here:

<URL:https://git.linuxtv.org/sailus/media_tree.git/log/?h=acpi-graph-cleaned>

since v2:

- Move patches changing the implementation of reading strings and
  implementing fwnode_get_next_parent() using the fwnode interface alone
  in front of the set. I kept them separate as they do change the
  implementation of these operations.

- Merge patches adding the fwnode_operations and moving the
  implementations of the non-graph portions of the fwnode property API to
  firmware specific locations.

- Merge moving graph operations to the same struct into another patch.
  The graph operations in the ops struct are also added in this patch now.

since v1: 

- Move the three bugfixes in front of the set into a separate patchset. 
  There are no dependencies to those from the rest of the patches.

- Rebase on current ACPI graph support patches (themselves on PM tree 
  4.11-rc1 merge).

Kind regards,
