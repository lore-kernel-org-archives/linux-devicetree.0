Glad to hear it, I didn't really want a new driver so similar to the
mux-gpio driver...

Not really intentional, it was just easy.

It will not change, the only change I will accept is if the code in
mux-gpio can be arranged to request the gpios with the idle-state from
the start. But even then, the default idle-state (0) will not change.
So, you should be safe.

I will look at the new patches later.

Peter
