Ok, so you are proposing the have a single node for all the SoCs
internal plls and clocks. The individual SoCs will have to deal
with the differences in a single driver, right?

Actually, the intermediate patch set sent before this one had a single
DT clock node. The most important draw-back of a single clock node
is that Berlin's global registers are more like a register dumpster.
Vital other registers, e.g. reset, are intermixed with clock registers.

Given the lack of public datasheets (I look everything up in some
auto-generated BSP includes), I like the current approach because it
helps to get in at least some structure to the register mess ;)

Considering the postponed of_clk_create_name() helper, that would allow
us to remove at least the names from DT again. Another option would be
a syscon node for the registers, that clk, reset, pinctrl drivers can
access. But IIRC early syscon support isn't settled, yet?

So, my current idea is:
- take this as is, stabilize berlin branches for v3.16
- review of_clk_create_name() and of_clk_get_parent_name() to allow
  to remove clock-output-names properties from Berlin (and other) dtsis
- maybe switch to early syscon if it is available in v3.16

I know this would likely break DT ABI policy, but hey who else boots
mainline Linux on his Chromecast currently except me :P

Is that okay with you (and DT folks)?
