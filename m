I thought you suggested to make controller driver accept the command
as another cell in client's mboxes property.
Which we can't do.

SCMI sends sub-commands via SHMEM, so it is always going to be 1cell for _scmi_.
However many firmwares are unlikely to use just one command over a
channel - say, the protocol is trivial or the linux and remote have no
SHMEM.

Sure. I have no problem with whatever we wanna call it.
