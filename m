A generic irqchip binding is not the right approach. The binding should
still be specific to the controller as the generic irqchip code doesn't
handle everything like dispatching interrupts or know how many blocks of
32 interrupts your controller has.

Yes, since someone else already has (me).

Look at my branch here:

git://sources.calxeda.com/kernel/linux.git irqdomain-for-grant

Your .init_irq function should call of_irq_init which will then call an
init function for each controller. Then you need to call
irq_setup_generic_chip_domain to setup the generic irqchip instances.

You also should convert to enabling CONFIG_MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER or I think
a linear domain won't work for you and that's what the generic irqchip
code will use. Also you should enable SPARSE_IRQ, but that is somewhat
independent.

In the DT case, you want to not have any compile time dependencies on
Linux irq numbers. If you're keeping non-DT compatibility, that will
complicate your conversion.
