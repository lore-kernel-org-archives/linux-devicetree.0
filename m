Got a pointer to what these properties look like?

Why does all this need to be a single property?

[] brackets are more generally used for optional params.

Platform is pretty overloaded meaning. Perhaps board_type would be more 
clear.

Can you define what these are exactly. I gather mb is RAM size.

How is this used?

What is USID?

Which example is more common?
