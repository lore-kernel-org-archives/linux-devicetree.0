Thanks for update on that.

Or SerDes driver can embed the status reg address space.
This is read only access so should be fine.

Serdes Driver with its status register address space might solve this
sharing problem. Library might work but we should try to have driver
considering there is a physical device. I don't have strong opinion
on drivers vs library.

Firmware interface usage seems to be correct way.
Thanks for giving the details. It helped me to get better picture.
