Agree, maybe this can come later?

Yes

Yes, specifically describe how the 2 cell address format is mapped
into the marvell target ID form.

Agree, it should be the mbus node..

Yes, that would be great:

#define MAP_ID(target_id,attributes) (((target_id) << 24) | ((attributes) << 16)) 0
#define MAP_BOOTROM MAP_ID(0xXXXX,0xXXXX)

Such that MAP_BOOTROM expands to two cells

Right,

Is the ranges right though? I was expecting this:

 ranges = <0  0x012f0000 0  0x8000000>

The 2nd address cell in the 2dword space should almost always be 0.

The 2nd address cell should be interprited as the offset within the
target's window, not as some kind of physical base address.

>>+ (Note that the windowid cell is encoding the target ID = 0x01 and attribute

... The proper place to indicate the base address for the window is in
the mbus ranges:

mbus {
   ranges = <0x012f0000 0  0xe8000000  0x8000000>
   devbus-bootcs {
       ranges = <0  0x012f0000 0  0x8000000>
   }
}

We shouldn't mangle the DT format just to make it convenient for
humans to write - if this is a major problem then I'd try to use the
preprocessor first.. There are several reasonable solutions down that
path, IMHO.

Internal regs has a special window register that doesn't have a target
id. We need to define an address cell for it, I suggest something like
<0xFFFFFFFF 0>, or <0x0000FFFF 0>...

This is tricky :| The PCIE controller needs both target IDs and the
aperture range to allocate them in.
