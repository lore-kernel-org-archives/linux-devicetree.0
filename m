This is a gpio-controller, for which this is what I would implement.

The problem comes more from the fact that the mcp2517fd is
primarily a CAN controller, which has a few GPIO pins.

So implementing a gpio-controller for those (rarely used) GPIOs
in the same driver seems a bit of an overkill.

The mcp2515 chip also supports 5 GPIO pins, but the driver
does not really make use of them, so they are left out.

The problem here is more the fact that the mcp2517fd supports
also push-pull/open-drain on some of those gpios.

And at least openDrain may be required on TXCan if used on a network
without a transceiver…

The settings as they are now are the “simple” version.
implementing a separate GPIO-controller driver just to implement the same
logic we have now would make it a much bigger driver without lots of extra
benefits.

So I hope the current proposal is ok...
