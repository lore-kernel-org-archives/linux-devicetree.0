Thanks.

Ok. I guess I was hoping for a more device centric approach like
we have for clks/regulators/etc. That way a driver doesn't need
to know it's using DT or not to figure out which API to call.
Also the global namespace is sort of worrying (qfprom0 part). How
do we know it's qfprom0? What if it's qfprom1 sometimes?

Also, how are we supposed to encode certain bits inside the
stream of bytes (blocks)? In some situations (e.g. the qcom CPR
stuff) we have quite a few fuse bits we need to read that are
packed into different bytes and may cross byte boundaries (i.e.
bits 6 to 10 of a 32-bit word). The current API looks to be byte
focused when I have bit based/non-byte aligned data.

My current feeling is that I don't want to use any of the block
stuff at all. I just want a simple byte-based API that allows me
to read a number of contiguous bytes from the fuses. Then I'll
need to shift that data down by a few bits and mask it with the
width of the data I want to read to extract the data needed.

The only thing after that where I have a problem is figuring out
which eeprom is present in the consumer driver. I think I may
need to open-code it and look at the phandle for the eeprom and
do a compatible check to figure out which bits I want to read.

The DT would be like this (note I left eeprom-cells/eeproms here
because that allows us to generically find eeproms used by a
device and find eeprom providers):

	qfprom: eeprom@58000 {
		compatible = "qcom,qfprom-msm8916";
		reg = <0x58000 0x7000>;
		#eeprom-cells = <0>;
	};
	
	cpr@b018000 {
		compatible = "qcom,cpr";
		reg = <0xb018000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 15 1>, <0 16 1>, <0 17 1>;
		eeproms = <&qfprom>;
		...
	};
