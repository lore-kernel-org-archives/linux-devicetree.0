So the root cause was the fact that the DFAB clock required by the SCM is an RPM
clock.  That support isn't present yet in the kernel, so SCM probe fails.

The core clock is really only accessed so that we can bump the clock on it up to
the max for performance.  As such, I'll make it optional in the platform code.

This does bring up the issue of probe defer causing issues with the spm driver,
as it calls set_warm_boot_addr.  That may have to be addressed, but is probably
a problem best fixed in the spm.

Regards,

Andy
