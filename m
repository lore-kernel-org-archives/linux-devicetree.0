You probably don't want to use just a threaded IRQ handler to
start the poll function, that would still require an extra indirection.

However, you can probably use the top half of the threaded
handler to request the poll function if necessary but use
the bottom half for anything that does not go through poll.

Right, that is definitely required here. I also had a look at
the gsi_channel_queue() function, which sits in the middle of
the transmit function and is rather unoptimized. I'd suggest moving
that into the caller so we can see what is going on, and then
optimizing it from there.

Makes sense, yes.
