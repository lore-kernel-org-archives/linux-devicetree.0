I believe my comment was directed somewhere a little different than
yours are.

My comment was simply that the *pathname* of the header file
imx35-pinfunc.h was Linux-specific. I would advocate replacing it with
e.g. <dt-bindings/pinctrl/imx35-pinfunc.h>. My belief is that the header
file is *part* of the binding, and so there will be a tree (currently
Documentation/devicetree/bindings in the kernel's copy) that contains
the *.txt bindings, and another tree (which I'm proposing storing in
include/dt-bindings as the kernel's copy) which contains the header
files, and which is known as the source of include files reference under
<dt-bindings/>.

Re: the license question: What is the license of the DT bindings
documentation? I don't recall having seen any license header in any of
the files, so I'd have to assume they're all GPLv2 since that's the
license of the kernel. Hence, Shawn having licensed his new headers
under the same license explicitly seems entirely consistent.

Sure. But note that I explicitly consider the header files as part of
the binding; it's just that for tabular/constant data, it's more
convenient to represent it in a header file than a more free-form table
in the DT binding document itself.

Just because something is machine parseable doesn't mean it shouldn't
also be human readable. Your argument could be applied to any piece of C
code too; it's meant for consumption by the compiler, so it doesn't
matter if people can read or maintain it?

Understanding is one thing. Nobody is going to argue against that. The
issue is remembering which bits are which, accidental typos that aren't
obvious, etc.

You state that as fact, but I disagree.

That's simply not true. I and Shawn are both programmers, and we would
find using a CPP macro name to set up GPIO IDs, IRQ/GPIO flags, etc.
much easier than referring to a DT binding document, manually or'ing
some bits together, and writing the result into the .dts file. It's
simply error-prone to do this manually, and unreadable after it's done.

Comments aren't compiled. So, it's easy to make a typo and get a comment
right but the integer value they comment on wrong. By using
defines/macros, the values *are* comments, just in a human-readable form.

Sorry, I'm having a hard time understanding that. The header should
already contain all defined fields/values, so there wouldn't be a need
to add more to it. If something ended up missing through oversight, it'd
be entirely appropriate to add it. I can't see why you'd end up with a
mix of defines and literals.

The value is arbitrary.

The concept of selecting a specific pinmux function on a particular pin
is certainly something that exists in HW. It's the very purpose of a
pinmux IP block, and there are explicitly register fields for it.

The fact that the IMX binding has a single integer that represents both
the pin ID and the function muxed onto it, rather than separately
representing the pin ID and the function as separate cells/fields does
admittedly seem rather odd to me. However, that fact already exists now,
before this patch, and so isn't anything to do with this patch.

Well, I certainly understand you don't want to use defines instead of
literals, but the simple fact is that many people writing device trees
/do/ very explicitly want that.
