I think you're talking about a PCI host bridge driver.  It would
definitely be nice to move toward a generic, shared driver.  Host
bridge drivers are responsible for enumerating the PCI hierarchy below
the bridge.  Enumeration is not really PCIe-specific, so I wouldn't
put it in drivers/pci/pcie.

I'm not really a driver person, but if you're writing a new driver,
wouldn't you use the iomap interfaces (ioremap(), ioread32(), etc)
rather than readl()?

I don't know what you're asking here.  Can you elaborate or give a
specific example?
