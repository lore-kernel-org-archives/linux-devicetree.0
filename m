Commit 52060836f79 ("dt-bindings: omap-rng: Document SafeXcel IP-76
device variant") update the omap_rng Device Tree binding to add support
for the IP-76 variation of the IP. As part of this change, a "clocks"
property was added, but is indicated as "Required", without indicated
it's actually only required for some compatible strings.

This commit fixes that, by explicitly stating that the clocks property
is only required with the inside-secure,safexcel-eip76 compatible
string.

Changes since v1:
 - Instead of indicating the property as optional, indicate it as
   mandatory for the inside-secure,safexcel-eip76 compatible string, as
   suggested by Rob Herring.
