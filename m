Please note; when using the DT, the linux virq number should be
dynamically assigned and therefore will not matter.  Historically
Exynos may have started from irq 32, but it doesn't really have any
relevance when all IRQ references are via DT irq specifiers.

Plus, for dynamically allocated irq_descs, I really want to make sure
that irq 0 never gets assigned.  We're not supposed to be using it,
and that becomes an easy rule to enforce when interrupt numbers are no
longer assigned with #defines.
