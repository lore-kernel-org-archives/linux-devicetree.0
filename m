Minor nit: Is it more common to use - rather than _ in compatible values?

Typo in "input" above.

The vendor prefix here is ste, but it's stericsson in the compatible
value above. They should be consistent. ste is nice since it's shorter,
but I see stericsson in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/vendor-prefixes.txt... I wonder if you
could register ste there too?

DT property names should definitely use - not _ as a delimiter.

Would ste,sleep-input = <0/1/2> be better? Not really a big deal either way.

Should the binding document mention what "pdis" is. It's probably not
necessary so long as "pdis" is something you can search for in the HW
documentation.

Hmm. That's rather tying the DT binding documentation to Linux code, and
DT binding docs should be OS-agnostic. Are the names identical to the HW
documentation? If so, perhaps you could reference that instead of the
Linux driver.

Those (and hence perhaps code that calls it?) is cut/paste from
pinctrl-tegra.c. Is it worth lifting the functions out into some common
code to share it?

There are some white-space issues there:

* Shouldn't be a space after the cast in sscanf() call.
* Should be a space after comma in sscanf() call.
* Should be a space after "for".

A lot of those are Booleans not U32s...
