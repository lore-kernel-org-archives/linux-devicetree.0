Ok, that looks good.

The proposed bindings are not making it compatible with the ACPI. In fact,
the ACPI bindings do need something similar to give us an explicit hardware
port number, which needs to be worked out. The only common theme shared
between the proposed ACPI and current DT bindings are the Generic Graph
bindings for describing the connections, which allows sharing the parsing
code independent of the platform, using fwnode_ops.
