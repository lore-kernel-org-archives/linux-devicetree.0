As I have written in the header, the spinlock protect the usage of the devi=
ce.
In this case, I need to lock just before writing the key in the device.

Since crypto operation could be called by software interrupt, I need to dis=
able them.

For sg_miter, the ATOMIC flag control the usage of kmap vs kmap_atomic.
Since kmap_atomic must not be held too long, I use them only for short cryp=
to operation.
But I need to rebench for be sure that using kmap_atomic give faster result=
.
If I keep that, I will add a comment explaining that.

The cra_alignmask is my guarantee.

No, it is clearly a remaining of the times where all my read/write was with=

There are two different problem: chunking and alignment.
The correct alignment is handled by the crypto API with the alignmask, so t=
he driver do not need to care about it.
The chunking is the fact that I can have a SG with a size that is non multi=
ple of 4.
For DES/3DES I handle this problem by using a fallback since DES/3DES was n=
ot my priority. (but yes I will handle it in the future)
For AES I have assumed that it cannot happen since no test in tcrypt check =
for it.
Since all SG I get was always a multiple of 16 (AES BLOCK SIZE) it was a so=
rt of confirmation.

Herbert ? does am I right or a chunking test is missing for cbc(aes) in tes=
tmgr.h
