Right. However, the patch adding that should have been sent to me, the
maintainer of the driver. That is carefully recorded in MAINTAINERS. So,
forgive me for assuming that nothing had changed in the driver behind my
back.

Had that patch been sent my way as it should have been, I would have
insisted that maintenance of the bindings had been kept together with
the maintenance of the driver.

Cheers,
Peter
