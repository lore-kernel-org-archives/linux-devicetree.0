(sigh, Jean-Christophe, it's a really good idea when replying to patches
to delete everything except what you're replying to so that others can
actually find what they wrote in the email...)

Indeed, everything works fine right now if you drop that. However, it is
correct practice to include a compatible value for the particular SoC
that incorporates the IP so that if in the future some SoC-specific
workaround is required, the compatible value needed to trigger this is
already in all historical .dts file.

Auto-detection is not necessarily a good idea; there's no reason in
general to believe that no future board will ever use a UART for any
purposes other than console/debug. Being explicit is probably good.
