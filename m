It is an incomplete dts, which has been true since the dts file for TC2 has
been merged in the kernel or better since the CCI bindings got merged in
the kernel.

It has been tested and we were aware that the dts in the kernel was missing
the CCI node, we were not really sure about what to do given the ongoing
discussions on dts in the kernel and so on and considered that we might
get the patch in as a fix eventually; we made a mistake, sorry.
