Hi Ray,

There are two options here: using clock-output-names or not using
clock-output-names.

I would recommend against using clock-output-names. If both your
clock driver and the peripheral devices that consume these clocks are
all represented in DT then you can skip clock-output-names and instead
create phandle linkage between the clocks inside of your clock provider
and the consumer devices. String names are still important here, but now
you only need to specify the string name as an *input* to the consumer
device, and not as an *output* from the clock provider node. Let's look
at how the qcom bindings do it:

gcc is a clock generator ip block.

arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom-apq8084.dtsi:
                gcc: clock-controller@fc400000 {
                        compatible = "qcom,gcc-apq8084";
                        #clock-cells = <1>;
                        #reset-cells = <1>;
                        reg = <0xfc400000 0x4000>;
                };

This same file includes this header:
#include <dt-bindings/clock/qcom,gcc-apq8084.h>

That header creates a map of clocks by numbers. An example:
#define GCC_BLSP2_UART2_APPS_CLK                        142

We can see how it used by the serial controller in
arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom-apq8084.dtsi:
                serial@f995e000 {
                        compatible = "qcom,msm-uartdm-v1.4", "qcom,msm-uartdm";
                        reg = <0xf995e000 0x1000>;
                        interrupts = <0 114 0x0>;
                        clocks = <&gcc GCC_BLSP2_UART2_APPS_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_BLSP2_AHB_CLK>;
                        clock-names = "core", "iface";
                        status = "disabled";
                };

Note the 'clock-names' property. This lists a string name which is a property
of the *consuming* device (uart controller), not the *providing* device (gcc
clock generator).

Finally, it all comes together in the driver simply using clk_get:
        msm_port->clk = devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, "core");
        if (IS_ERR(msm_port->clk))
                return PTR_ERR(msm_port->clk);

        if (msm_port->is_uartdm) {
                msm_port->pclk = devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, "iface");
                if (IS_ERR(msm_port->pclk))
                        return PTR_ERR(msm_port->pclk);

                clk_set_rate(msm_port->clk, 1843200);
        }

This works because we have created linkage between the clock phandle and
the consuming device node. The shared header is used by the Linux kernel
to look up the clock as well as the consumer node to map the string name
onto a clock input.

Back to clock-output-names:

If you decide to keep using clock-output-names you can still represent
the pll clock in your "clock-output-names". In a perfect world DT nodes
that use clock-output-names would only expose the leaf clocks that your
peripheral devices consume, but there is no technical reason why your
pll can't be a part of the clock-output-names array. It is simply an
array of string names that maps to an index. There is no sense of
parent-child hierarchy in the DT binding, so there is no problem adding
a parent pll clock to the array of clock-output-names. I think that this
will tactically solve your problem in the short term, but I encourage
you to inspect the qcom binding example I gave above to see if it a
better fit for you long term.

Mike
