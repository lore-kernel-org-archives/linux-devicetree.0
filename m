I don't quite understand the reason for not being syscon. The definition
of syscon says that, "System controller node represents a register region
containing a set of miscellaneous registers. The registers are not cohesive
enough to represent as any specific type of device." which exactly fits
this case. Only the registers of CMU & RMU are shared and not the HW block!

Can you please clarify?

Thanks,
