I would be happier if we could unify the common clock infrastructure, it
would make this kind of thing a lot lessy messy. However, I'm not
against the system-clock-frequency property for now.

Sorry for the confusion, I'll try to be less ambiguous in future :)

What I was trying to get at here is that if there is neither a clock or
a system-clock-frequency property in the device tree, dai->sysclk will
not have been initialised in this path. Is this a valid case, and will
dai->sysclk have a well-defined, sane value?

Thanks,
Mark.
