Okay. Seems unrelated to DMA though. Will check the status of SPI on my
DA850 EVM once I get the chance.

pinctrl-single supports a different compatible "pinconf-single" which
supports the pinconf interface that can be used to set pullup and
pulldown bias.

Unfortunately, in case of AM18x, there are two registers to touch:
PUPD_ENA and PUPD_SEL. So I believe the pinctrl-single driver cannot be
used.

There are pinconf operations pin_config_group_{set|get}(). Based on
documentation these are meant to act on a group of pins. There are quite
a few drivers implementing this interface. Perhaps they can be used as
an example.

Also, this needs to be done in a way that can be used by other boards
too, so please move the common properties to da850.dtsi. Only the board
specific pullup/down configuration should be in this file.

pins are usually attached to the node that consumes the GPIO pins, not
to the gpio node itself.

If the pins are not connected to anything and can be used via gpio
sysfs, then "pinctrl hog" or "board level pinmux" is to be used.
Something like below:

+&pmx_core {
+       pinctrl-names = "default";
+       pinctrl-0 = <&in1_pins>;
+
+       in1_pins: pinmux_in1_pins {
+               pinctrl-single,bits = <
+                       0x0 0x00000008 0x0000000f
+			...
+               >;
+       };
+};

That said, device tree is supposed to describe hardware and not change
depend on current driver support. So I would wait for the driver to get
merged before merging the pins that are used by it. It looks like you
wont be able to use the support in a meaningful way till then anyway.

Okay, then please keep the node enabled.

Alright, thanks for the detailed explanation.
