Right, I was only asking for:
(1) a more accurate DT and
(2) clarity in the driver; the clarity might just be "we don't support
    multi-CS"

Nope, sounds good to me.

A few tips:
 * be defensive; i.e., error out if someone specifies 2 flash in the DT
 * use the 'reg' property to be the addressing index in the flash
   sub-node; i.e., the chip-select. This fits the practice done by most
   others, I think.
