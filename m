At the least we have reg-names users.

It would be nice if the drivers didn't have to do this. It annoys me
that platform drivers need to know that they're using DT to figure out
things that are standard platform features: registers, irqs, etc.

What's Josh's original proposal? We've already punted on this for SSBI
PMICs and just required them to put registers in DT for use some day and
I don't see anyone blocking individual SPMI pmic drivers from merging
over this. So I guess I agree with you that we can move forward with the
other drivers. I'd still like to see us make this better though, so it
seems worthwhile to have the discussion and get to some conclusion.
