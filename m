I actually requested adding that as the practice, as far as I've understood
it, has been to document all properties relevant for the hardware (apart
from things such as assigned-clocks etc.).

The port and endpoints have been elaborated above and I think that should
be fine as-is.

The graph bindings document (referred by video-interfaces.txt) the
remote-endpoint property in an endpoint as an optional property, however
you can't really use the sensor if it's not connected to anything. The same
goes for video-interfaces.txt: remote-endpoint in an endpoint is optional.

I have no objections removing remote-endpoint here, though, if you think
it's not relevant here.
