Hi Jacopo,

Thanks for the feedback!

Yes, I can add some words, but I would like to clear up the naming
before re-spinning.

g_fmt/s_fmt says nothing to me. Graphics format? Source Format? I have
no idea if those guesses are even close? So, that seems like poor naming
to me. The only reason I see to go that way is for the sake of consistency.

You mean rename the function to drm_bridge_g_fmt(), right?

As indicated above, I'm not that fond of it, but don't really care
either. Maintainers?

Not passing down the call does one of two things. Either all bridges have
to implement the call or all users have to walk the pipeline "manually".
I don't like either or those options, so I still think it is good to
pass the call down the pipeline.

*time passes*

Oh, you do not think it is useful for the bridge to have a callback but
still report "no format change", and that the call down to pipeline
should only happen for bridges that have not implemented the op. But I
do think that is useful, see below.

Ok, I can change that, it just seemed like a convoluted case to me.
I mean, if this was a real issue and complicated pipelines were
common, something along the lines of this patch series would be
available already. Right? I guess not, but how the &#/%# have people
been coping?

Unless the bridge optionally changes the format. If the bridge has no
way to say "no format change" even with the callback in place, it
has to juggle different ops structs, which seems like a big hammer.
So, I'm in favor of calling down the pipeline in two cases. A) when
a bridge does not implement the op and B) when the op returns zero.

Maintainers?

The naming here should obviously follow the naming of the exported function.
