actually it's only a "problem" when introducing support for new
devices. can you please forward this question to the stmmac
maintainers, as I think your idea of enabling auto-detection when
there are no children in the MDIO-bus makes sense

what do you mean exactly? currently the TX-delay is hardcoded in
dwmac-meson8b. patch 4 moves the hardcoded value from the
dwmac-meson8b to the .dts-files.
unfortunately the corresponding dwmac-meson8b patch was not accepted
yet, so at the moment patch 4 should be a no-op.

this seems to be a "best practice" when the PHY ID is known, see [0]
If you know the PHY ID of the Micrel PHY then please let me know, then
we can include this in the fix for the p20x boards
