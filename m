Yes, I kind of expected the same, and the flag description seems to =

imply so too:

     #define CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED	BIT(3) /* do not gate even if unused */

It required adding an extra parameter to __clk_disable/__clk_unprepare =

to keep track of the call's explicitness, and ignore the =

disable/unprepare callback on the implicit case (when =

__clk_disable/__clk_unprepare is called recursively) if the flag is set. =

This also means adding a wrapping function to at least __clk_unprepare, =

so as to to not break callers outside of the clk framework. Overall it =

felt too hacky for something that could be properly handled by the =

generic code if it had at least 1 user.

I would like to hear Mike's thoughts on this; maybe CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED is =

not what we think it should be.

Nice to know, thanks for the information :)
