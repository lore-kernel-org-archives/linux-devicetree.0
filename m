You can use the alias in your dts to refer to the node instead of the
more complicate name. Further you bring a order to all devices of the
same type and you can make use of the number in the alias for other
purposes, which is however not used for CAN afaik.

Have a look at the existing imx*.dtsi files. If there are already
aliases for a given device type, then it makes sense to add new devices
of that type to the alias aswell.
