Right, so the SPDIF output on Dove isn't multiplexed, so I was wrong on
that _for_ _dove_, but that may not necessarily be the case for the
Kirkwood SoCs - the pin may be multiplexed there.

However, Dove does have two I2S/SPDIF controllers which are otherwise
identical, apart from one having SPDIF support and the other not.
Setting the SPDIF enable bit on the one without is unspecified what
the behaviour would be, so it should not be set.
