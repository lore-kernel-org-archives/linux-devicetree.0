Are these duplicates of the values in rpi_clocks[]? Why not just store a
pointer to or index of the entry in that array?

The overloading of last_rate to represent both rate information and
on/off status is slightly confusing. I would have expected this function
to clear last_rate to 0 when switching the clock off, and some specific
rate when turning a clock on. Is there some guarantee that the clock
core will always call recalc_rate() at certain times, thus ensuring that
last_rate is always accurate?

Wouldn't it be simpler to let last_rate always represent that actual
rate, and have a separate last_on or is_on field to represent the
enable/disable state?

Since this is a query API, I wouldn't have expected it to have
side-effects like this. Don't we know what rate the clock runs at based
on the firmware's response in set_rate()?

Don't you need to multiply the size by ARRAY_SIZE(rpi_clocks)? I assume
onecell->clks is an array with one entry per each of onecell->clk_num?
Yes, the for loop right after that allocation confirms this.
