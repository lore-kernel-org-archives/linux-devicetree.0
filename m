Most functions on da850 are available only on one physical pin. So every
board that needs that functionality needs to setup the pinmux the same
way. This was the idea behind adding pinmux to da850.dtsi rather than
repeating it for every board.

Even though the pinctrl entries are there in da850.dtsi, the pinmux
registers wont be touched unless the status is set to "okay" for that
device in board .dts file.

The only care that needs to be taken is that the pins listed in
da850.dtsi need to be the minimum required for achieving that
functionality. If a board needs more than what is populated in
da850.dtsi then it can define its own pinctrl entries overriding that
coming from da850.dtsi

Thanks,
Sekhar
