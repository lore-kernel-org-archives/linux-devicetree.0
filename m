Hello all,

I was working on fixing up the tlv320aic31xx driver when I noticed
its gpio reset was not working, it was due to this driver looking
for "gpio-reset" instead of the usual "reset-gpio". A quick check
shows this mistake is rare and only copied by one other audio CODECs:

$ git grep "reset-gpio" | wc -l
630
$ git grep "gpio-reset" | wc -l
6

Luckliy the two effected drivers only use this reset line when power
has been cut to the device, so not only were these optional
properties but they had no real functional effect anyway. Lets
just fix this typo before is spreads to drivers were it matters.

I've also added fixes tags to each patch so it can be individually
back-ported to where this bug was introduced if one wanted to. I'm
hoping this can sit on next for a while to get the most testing,
just in case I'm wrong about this not breaking anything :)

Thanks,
Andrew
