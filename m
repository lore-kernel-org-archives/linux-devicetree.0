Hi Andreas,

Like I replied of my RFT patch :
I really disagree about relying on any work or properties added by any bootloader here, Amlogic SoCs has
a lot of u-boot versions in the field, and the Odroid-C2 is part of this.

Even if Odroid-c2 is in mainline U-Boot or not, the mainline Linux kernel should work using
any U-boot version even with the one provided by Amlogic on their openlinux distribution channel.

Handling multiple RAM configuration is another story, and the Arm-Soc and DT maintainers should give us
their advices.

Actually there is a severe bug fixed here that cause a huge crash if such memory is not reserved while
running stock u-boot version on various shipped products and Amlogic's own development boards.

The bug is easily triggered by running :
# stress --vm 4 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 10s &
[   46.937975] Bad mode in Error handler detected on CPU1, code 0xbf000000 -- SError
...
[   47.058536] Internal error: Attempting to execute userspace memory: 8600000f [#3] PREEMPT SMP
...

Note this is a fix targeted for 4.10 to make the system stable and various users reported some severe
crash now the system has more drivers and read-world use-cases are running on Amlogic SoCs.

Please feel free to push whatever changes that makes this memory reservation more coherent for 4.11,
and respect the behavior of already shipped u-boot version and mainline U-Boot, UEFI, whatever...

Neil
