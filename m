Sure, that'd be fine, assuming that it is necessary (see below).

OK. Is there any restriction on which SPI an ICU can generate?

Indeed. And maybe we should have an instance of the ICU device per CP.

If the ICU has no knowledge of the SPI it can generate, I'd rather put
that in the GICP node.

That makes a lot more sense now, thanks.

But if both ports are enabled, you're going to allocate one SPI per call
to this function, and the last one wins (you never "remember" that you
have configured one port already, and always allocate a new interrupt).

Sure.

Given how small that code is, it wouldn't be a big deal.
