In this SoC's case the driver is not essential. A system that does not
use UART1..4 will not ever call on the driver. This situation is
common as the console uses UART5.

This is an appropriate default, as it causes the least surprise to a
user. Without taking the UART out of reset, the kernel driver still
loads, but characters are never drained from the FIFO.

Advanced users may want to save the few kilobytes that an extra driver
adds, and the boot overhead of loading yet another driver. The saving
is small, so if you feel strongly about it we can drop this patch.

Cheers,
