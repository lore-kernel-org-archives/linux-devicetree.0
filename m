Also the other way around: Sometimes you want to install the same
kernel on systems with old and new bootloaders, without touching the
bootloaders (due to that not being powerfail-safe, say).  The kernel
needs to know if it's passed a DT from a newer bootloader or not.

And sometimes you'd like to install a newer, tested kernel (that uses
DTs) on systems with old bootloaders.

You can't always update the boot loader.  Sometimes you're stuck with
what's there for the life of a device.  Either it's ROM, or it's too
risky to modify in place.

Embedded devices usually don't have any way for the "user" to choose
from a boot menu ;-)

ATAG_DEVTREE sounds good to me for mix'n'match systems.

New systems that always use DTs could use _just_ ATAG_DEVTREE, to
avoid questions of conflicting info.  They could also settle on a
fixed R1 value meaning "devtree platform".

Or if a fixed "devtree platform" R1 is used, R2 could point directly
at the DT, no atag list in that specific case.
