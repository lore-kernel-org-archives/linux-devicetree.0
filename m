Okay fine.

We can free allocated descriptor in forward order from head or in
reverse order, I just followed here fsldma.c driver.
Does this make sense ??

Still I am clear here, why memcpy will do buffer mapping, I see other
drivers and also async_memcpy.c , they only map it and pass mapped
physical dma address to driver.

Buffer mapping mean you here is dma_map_xxx ?? Am I correct.

So basically case here for me is completion of dma descriptor
submitted to hw is not same as order of submission to hw.
So scenario coming in multithread running :e.g. let's assume we have
submitted two descriptors first has cookie 1001 and second has 1002,
now 1002 is completed first, so updated last_completed_cookie as 1002
but not yer checked for dma_tx_status, and then first cookie completes
and update last_completed_cookie as 1001, now second transaction check
for tx_status and it get DMA_IN_PROGRESS, because
last_completed_cookie(1001) is less than second transaction's
cookie(1002).

Due to this issue I am traversing that transaction in pending list and
running list, if not there means we are done.

Does this make sense??

Please see my above comment.
