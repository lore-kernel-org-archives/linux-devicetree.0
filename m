No. Read the schematic again. CAREFULLY. The pin that feeds the WiFi module
is called X32KFOUT. With an "F". The A33 datasheet says the pin is "Clock
Output of LOSC (X32KFOUT can be gating)". The A64 datasheet may not mention
the output can be gated, but the LOSC_OUT_GATING_REG register is aptly named
"LOSC Output Gating Register".

And see below about the EXT_LOSC_EN bit. You are confusing input to the RTC
module vs output from the RTC module. All crystals have an IN and an OUT
connection. It's just the way they work.

You are focusing on the wrong thing. From the driver's point of view,
we simply don't care about this bit. It is by default on. We might want
to force enable it if some broken bootloader turns it off, but that is
besides the point here. And on all the other SoCs, the absence of this
bit means that the external crystal will always be on.

Furthermore, this bit concerns the "input" from the crystal to the RTC.
What I'm concerned about, and what you should be concerned about, because
that's what you're using, is the LOSC_OUT_GATING_EN bit. As mentioned this
does not exist on the A31.

That's not correct. On the A31, the RTC's LOSC still feeds the CCU,
so output index 0 is always valid. Output index 1 on the A31 is invalid
because it simply doesn't have this in the hardware. Furthermore, you're
still not dealing with the fact that one A23/A33 the IOSC is 600~700 kHZ,
on the A64/H3/H5/H6 it is 16 MHz, and on the V3/V3s it is 32 kHz. The
first two cases also have prescalers to divide the clock rate down to
around 32 kHz. All these hardware details need to be tied to new compatible
strings, so that the driver knows about them and can handle them if needed.
What you're describing is very fragile and pretty much a hack. We already
have enough of those.
