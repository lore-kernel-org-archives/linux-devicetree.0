How many instances do you have?

It is easier to put the data into the kernel and move it to DT later
than vice-versa. I don't think it is a good idea to do a custom
binding here and one that only addresses caches and nothing else in
the interconnect. So either we define an extensible and future-proof
binding or put the data into the kernel for now.
