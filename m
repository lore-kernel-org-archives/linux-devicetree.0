Ok, but you could still describe the hardwired part of it (Audio muxes,
codecs, busses and physical interfaces). Isn't that what OF is all about?
In our case, its just a simple AC97 codec connected to a simple AC97 bus.
Sounds like total overkill having to write a "fabric driver" for this....
while there are already quite a few that are all 99% the same!

Seems like its hard to find a vendor- and OS-neutral entity to host this?
OpenBIOS maybe?
