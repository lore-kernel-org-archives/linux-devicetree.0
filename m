That sounds almost like it should be a separate patch against
include/linux/types.h:

diff --git a/include/linux/types.h b/include/linux/types.h

But whether it's a good idea for me to detour from fw_cfg/sysfs into
sorting this out with the kernel community right now, I don't know :)

I'll just try to do it inside the fw_cfg sysfs driver for now, see how
that goes...

Input might end after reading 'base', in which case %n would store the
next character's index in consumed, and evaluate (but otherwise
ignore) the remaining pointer arguments (including the second &consumed).

Or, it might end after reading data_off, then the earlier value of
consumed gets overwritten with the new (past data_off) index. I get to
verify that str[index] is '\0', i.e. that there were no left-over,
unprocessed characters, whether I got one or three items processed by
scanf.

I don't think passing '&consumed' in twice is a problem. I also didn't
cleverly come up with this myself, but rather lifted it from
drivers/virtio/virtio_mmio.c, so at least there's precedent :)

Just like (I think) is the case with virtio_mmio, this is an optional
feature to allow specifying a base address, range, and register
offsets for fw_cfg via the insmod (or modprobe) command line, so one
would already have to be root. Also, perfectly well-formated base and
size values could be used to hose the system, which is why virtio_mmio
(and also fw_cfg) leave this feature off by default, and recommend
caution before one would turn it on.

Thanks much,
