I thought about it and IMHO it is a more complicated change in DTS (and
no doubts in the driver), which hides the structure of hardware. There
is no one PWM with two channels.

There are two independent PWMs, even control registers are different,
PWM2 can be programmed to output the internal interrupt status, and it
means that possibly in future I may want to describe one of the PWMs
with a different "compatible" property.

It is done -- http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.pwm/2831

Thanks for review.
