Thanks for your reply.

OK.

Could you explain what the above values are? If they are values written to 
a 4-bit mux that selects RX clock source, then all the 16 clocks should be 
specified from device tree, even if they are duplicated.

Are the clock names you used above names of clock inputs of the S/PDIF 
block or names of SoC-wide clocks?

Can the assignment of clock inputs change? For example on one SoC

0000 if (DPLL Locked) SPDIF_RxClk else extal_clk
0001 if (DPLL Locked) SPDIF_RxClk else spdif_clk
...
0101 extal_clk
0110 spdif_clk
...

and on another

0000 if (DPLL Locked) SPDIF_RxClk else spdif_clk
0001 if (DPLL Locked) SPDIF_RxClk else extal_clk
...
0101 extal_clk
0110 spdif_clk
...

(notice the swapped 0000 and 0001 inputs)

Same goes for the TX mux. If it is a 3-bit, 8-input mux, then it should be 
described in device tree separately, as it is different than the 4-bit, 
16-input RX mux.

What happens if the "DPLL locked" condition doesn't match? When this can 
happen?

I still don't understand the meaning of this property. Could you explain 
it please?
