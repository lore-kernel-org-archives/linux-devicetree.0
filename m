Actually I don't know any approach to get the version number of the
designware block used.  Maybe they are actually using the same version
of the IP block, and the differences in the driver are actually caused
by the differences in SoC integration.

There doesn't seem to be this kind of register for the PCIe block.

Minghuan,

Please correct me if you know more. :)
