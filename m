I don't remember the exact details of our past discussion, but I
(still) don't really think that this would work well. I see two main
shortcomings with that approach:

  - I guess that the main reason you want to do that would be to have
    easy DT backward compatibility. Yet, the addition of the
    reset-delay-us would break that compatibility, since drivers that
    would have been converted now need to have it somehow, but older
    DTs wouldn't have it

  - There's so many variations of the reset-gpios property name that
    you wouldn't be able to cover all the cases anyhow, at least
    without breaking the compatibility (again).

But I also see your point, and you're right that converting everyone
to a gpio-reset node will not happen (even though I'd still really
like to have that binding).

What about having a function that would be called by the consumer to
instantiate that reset controller from a GPIO for us, instead of
trying to do it automatically? That function could take the property
name that holds the GPIO, which would cover the second drawback, and
the delay, which would cover the first.

And in order to cover shared GPIO reset lines, we could just look at
the one already created by other drivers, and if one has been created,
we just give the reference to that one instead of creating it.

Does that make sense?
