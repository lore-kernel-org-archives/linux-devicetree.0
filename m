We introduced them for turning the phys on and off.

We don't do any derivation from this information. It is the same for
all devices, since it is in the kirkwood-*.dtsi file, not per board.

Also, orion5x does not allow such control of the phys, they are always
on. So i don't know if we can derive anything from this information,
since it is not always present.
