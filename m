I think the answer to that is rather obvious. If you design with these
components from the get-go, I see no problem with them, but it simply
seems way easier to retrofit device-links. Just take a look at my
untested patch and patch v3 2/2 from Jyri [1] for panels (that presumably
fix the big issue, namely leaving wild pointers). They either don't touch
neither suppliers nor consumers or are totally trivial (assigning a new
.owner field in suppliers). Compare that with adding a couple of dozen
boilerplate lines with hook functions etc to each and every drm_device,
drm_panel and drm_bridge.

Couple that with the fact that apparently the problem of unbinding
and leaving wild pointers hasn't been all that prevalent, implying that
the problem of rebinding can't be all that critical either.

But what do I know?

Cheers,
Peter

[1] I can't seem to find it in archives, so I'm including it here for
reference. It's small enough.
