OK, so how about making that para read:

+ The general principle of the naming scheme for Secure world bindings
+ is that any property that needs a different value in the Secure world
+ can be supported by prefixing the property name with "secure-". So for
+ instance "secure-foo" would override "foo". For property names with
+ a vendor prefix, the Secure variant of "vendor,foo" would be
+ "vendor,secure-foo". If there is no "secure-" property then the Secure
+ world value is the same as specified for the Normal world by the
+ non-prefixed property. However, only the properties listed below may
+ validly have "secure-" versions; this list will be enlarged on a
+ case-by-case basis.
