currently we are using it in H:4 protocol mode. Using it in H:5 protocol mode (aka 3-wire) would require a lot of extra work. There is some work ongoing for the Realtek hardware that is actually always 3-wire.

Maybe the Broadcom hardware auto-detects H:4 vs H:5 protocol and switches accordingly. You could try to work with the Realtek patches and see if we can get that going with the Broadcom chips as well.

On the other hand, when not using the shutdown GPIO entry in the DT, does everything work fine for you?

Marcel
