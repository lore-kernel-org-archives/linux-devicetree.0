Hi Mark,

I started prototyping this, but ran into a couple of issues:

1) How do we tell the difference between "regcache contains a
non-default value that correctly reflects the hardware register
contents" versus "regcache contains a non-default value that is
waiting to be written when we exit cache_only mode"?

2) Does that also mean that we should store default values in the
rbtree if they are part of a deferred cache_only write, but not store
them if the write went through to the hardware?

3) If we're caching the default values lazily, does that mean that
every regcache read would incur both an rbtree lookup and a bsearch of
the reg_defaults array?

4) If "the only things in the cache will be things that have been
explicitly changed," that could impact the semantics of
regcache_drop_region().  Which fortunately has no users.

Seems like it would be more straightforward just to add an
rbnode->dirty bitmask alongside rbnode->cache_present, rather than
trying to infer the hardware state from the presence/absence of the
cache entry.  Knowing whether each individual register is out of sync
with the hardware lets us avoid unnecessary writes in both situations:
full reset, and temporary loss of register access.

What do you think?
