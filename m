Actually, if frame rate were added to link validation then
[gs]_frame_interval would have to be mandatory, even if the
subdev has no control over frame rate, again this is like
set_fmt. Otherwise, if a subdev has not implemented
[gs]_frame_interval, then frame rate validation across
the whole pipeline is broken. Because, if we have

A -> B -> C

and B has not implemented [gs]_frame_interval, and C is expecting
30 fps, then pipeline validation would succeed even though A is 
outputting 60 fps.
