The patch

   ASoC: qdsp6: dt-bindings: Add apq8096 machine bindings

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

+* Qualcomm Technologies APQ8096 ASoC sound card driver
+
+This binding describes the APQ8096 sound card, which uses qdsp for audio.
+
+- compatible:
+	Usage: required
+	Value type: <stringlist>
+	Definition: must be "qcom,apq8096-sndcard"
+
+- qcom,audio-routing:
+	Usage: Optional
+	Value type: <stringlist>
+	Definition:  A list of the connections between audio components.
+		  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
+		  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
+		  source. Valid names could be power supplies, MicBias
+		  of codec and the jacks on the board:
+		  Valid names include:
+
+		Board Connectors:
+			"Headphone Left"
+			"Headphone Right"
+			"Earphone"
+			"Line Out1"
+			"Line Out2"
+			"Line Out3"
+			"Line Out4"
+			"Analog Mic1"
+			"Analog Mic2"
+			"Analog Mic3"
+			"Analog Mic4"
+			"Analog Mic5"
+			"Analog Mic6"
+			"Digital Mic2"
+			"Digital Mic3"
+
+		Audio pins and MicBias on WCD9335 Codec:
+			"MIC_BIAS1
+			"MIC_BIAS2"
+			"MIC_BIAS3"
+			"MIC_BIAS4"
+			"AMIC1"
+			"AMIC2"
+			"AMIC3"
+			"AMIC4"
+			"AMIC5"
+			"AMIC6"
+			"AMIC6"
+			"DMIC1"
+			"DMIC2"
+			"DMIC3"
+= dailinks
+Each subnode of sndcard represents either a dailink, and subnodes of each
+dailinks would be cpu/codec/platform dais.
+
+- link-name:
+	Usage: required
+	Value type: <string>
+	Definition: User friendly name for dai link
+
+= CPU, PLATFORM, CODEC dais subnodes
+- cpu:
+	Usage: required
+	Value type: <subnode>
+	Definition: cpu dai sub-node
+
+- codec:
+	Usage: Optional
+	Value type: <subnode>
+	Definition: codec dai sub-node
+
+- platform:
+	Usage: Optional
+	Value type: <subnode>
+	Definition: platform dai sub-node
+
+- sound-dai:
+	Usage: required
+	Value type: <phandle with arguments>
+	Definition: dai phandle/s and port of CPU/CODEC/PLATFORM node.
+
+Example:
+
+audio {
+	compatible = "qcom,apq8096-sndcard";
+	qcom,model = "DB820c";
+
+	mm1-dai-link {
+		link-name = "MultiMedia1";
+		cpu {
+			sound-dai = <&q6asmdai MSM_FRONTEND_DAI_MULTIMEDIA1>;
+		};
+	};
+
+	hdmi-dai-link {
+		link-name = "HDMI Playback";
+		cpu {
+			sound-dai = <&q6afe HDMI_RX>;
+		};
+
+		platform {
+			sound-dai = <&q6adm>;
+		};
+
+		codec {
+			sound-dai = <&hdmi 0>;
+		};
+	};
