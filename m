I'd put this info in the driver itself.  I believe it has 4 fixed states.

I agree.  All of this needs to be done inside the code itself.  All you need is
the register.  This is a TCSR register which means that it could have other bits
doing other things.  I would hope that the hw guys isolated only regulator bits
in here.
