The clock bindings are special because the macros there tend to be made
up for controllers that just have a bunch of clocks at random register
locations.

This is not the case for DMA bindings (or some of the more regular clock
controllers), so there is absolutely no reason to define those macros
in a header file, it just adds artificial dependencies between the
driver, SoC support and the binding.

If the numbers are the same as the ones provided in the data sheet,
just use the numbers and remove the macros.

You are right, your code is actually correct on all combinations
of big-endian and little-endian ARM CPUs. However, I would argue that
it's unusual style, and not portable to other architectures (e.g. arm64)
because the definition of readl() is highly architecture dependent.
It would also be problematic if the arm definition has to change
in some form and this driver is overlooked.

I would still recommend doing an implementation like

static inline u16 edma_readw(struct fsl_edma_engine *edma, u16 val, unsigned long offset)
{
	if (edma->big_endian)
		iowrite16be(val, edma->membase + offset);
	else
		iowrite16(val, edma->membase + offset);
}


This would simplify the callers that now can replace

        cur_addr = EDMA_SWAP32(fsl_chan->edma, edma_readl(addr + EDMA_TCD_SADDR(ch)));

with 

	cur_addr = edma_readl(fsl_chan->edma, EDMA_TCD_SADDR(ch));

which IMHO is much easier to read. For accessing muxbase, you
don't have to use your own version, because all accesses are
single-byte.

BTW, I noticed that fsl_edma_set_tcd_params() is calling edma_writew()
and edma_writel() without an endian-swap, so I assume it is still
broken on big-endian CPUs, and likely also on big-endian eDMA engines.

Ah, so the error interrupt is level triggered? That's ok then.

Ah, I missed that you only check the mux number, not the channel number.

The current version however is buggy because you don't check that you
are actually looking at the right eDMA instance, or an eDMA at all, rather
than some other random dma engine that may be connected to an external
bus.

It is possible to fix that, but I suspect that would involve more
complex code than finding an appropriate channel first and then
calling dma_get_slave_chan() on that.
I would suggest keeping a list of channels per dmamux and walking that
list until you find one that succeeds in dma_get_slave_chan().
