That moves the discussion to what "strong conventions" are?
But you have already removed the layout, so this is meaningless.

You mean, igb in U-Boot, right?
Unless I'm missing something, it should work just fine in Linux with
the same U-Boot Compulab provides.

That is exactly what I said: "to play the bootargs games".

Yep. While if we provide the default layout in DT, all the above would be
unnecessary.

So, if one will neither use the latest U-Boot, nor play the bootargs
games, the flash will stay a kind of "black box" - and that's a pity.
