No, I'm saying why even put cache-slices properties in DT to begin
with? You could just define client id's within the kernel and clients
can use those instead of getting the id from the DT.

I have a couple of hesitations with putting this into the DT. First, I
think a cache is just one aspect of describing the interconnect
between masters and memory (and there's been discussions on
interconnect bindings too) and any binding needs to consider all of
the aspects of the interconnect. Second, I'd expect this cache
architecture will change SoC to SoC and the binding here is pretty
closely tied to the current cache implementation (e.g. slices). If
there were a bunch of SoCs with the same design and just different
client IDs (like interrupt IDs), then I'd feel differently.
