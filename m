Well, I guess this will work as well. And I am probably biased towards
the style I mentioned because AM335x and other TI OMAP processors
follow that.

To make it easy to review that we have all bases covered, can you model
the all PLLC0 and PLLC1 (input and output) clocks for the next version?

Ideally the OSCIN vs CLKIN selection should be another clock mux whose
output is one of the input clocks to PLL controller. But I can see the
difficulty in handling that as the mux itself is controlled by the PLL
controller.

Also, please add the oscin-square-wave to the binding definition too.

For the benefit of others reviewing and not familiar with the hardware,
the users guide for DA850 is here:
http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruh77c/spruh77c.pdf

and the PLL block diagram is on page 143 (Figure 8-1).
