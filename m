I'm not sure how this should work in a device tree world, I'd *hope*
we'd get a device tree node for the CPU and could then just make this a
regular consumer thing but then the cpufreq drivers would need to be
updated to make use of it.  The only reason we allow null devices right
now is the fact that cpufreq doesn't have a struct device it can use.

I think we need an of_get_phandle(), it'd be clearer what the check is,
more type safe and would avoid needing to replicate the check.
