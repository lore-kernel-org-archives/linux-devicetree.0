So far we haven't added any Xs in the model names for our SoC
support. Even for IPQ806X, we have it as IPQ8064 as the config
name with IPQ806x in the help text because there's IPQ8062 out
there. So I guess it should be IPQ4019 or something?

This file is not complete and I don't see any other silicon
vendors doing this, so please drop the entire file.

Same here, we should know what model number is on the board.

Doesn't the bootloader fill the memory node for us? Why do we
need this?

Please don't add bootargs. Use stdout-path for the console part
and everything else should be done by the bootloader or is the
defaults.

These two should also be specific and drop the Xs. Same goes for
the file name.

This node is not a child of the SoC node. It should be at the
root level.

Drop this clock-frequency part if you can. The hardware should
properly report the frequency.

Don't you need some clocks here?

This hunk should be in a separate patch.

And these two should also go as a separate patch.
