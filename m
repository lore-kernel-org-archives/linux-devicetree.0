I agree it seems better that the driver should allocate them dynamically.
However my attempts to reset the runtime addresses all fail, with the
device in question rejecting the request.

I'll run some more tests. Another way would be for the driver to test
if the device was already allocated an address, and just use that. If
not, then just allocate one to it. The implementation is a bit more
complicated, as there's no lookup function.

But if we cannot reliably reset the runtime addresses, I don't see
any alternative to putting the address in the DT. Most of the use cases
we want to support are PMICs, which are initialized by the boot loader.
