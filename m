Just to jump back a stage.  The binding here isn't stm32 specific
at all.  In general this binding allows for triggering anything
(currently IIO) from an interrupt. Nothing more - so that is the
level at which it should be considered.

Again, taking this in the general sense rather than on the stm32:
flexibility - if it makes sense to expose something to userspace we
do.  We could in theory list all the possible interrupt sources that
might drive each device in a system and then expose that to userspace
but that is hideous!
