So what you're saying is that the definition of this register has become
soo loose that it's completely useless.  Oh what a really great move.

Your designers really need their heads bashed against a brick wall to
knock some sense into them over stuff like this.  It's exactly this
kind of idiotic 'infinite flexibility' that Linus had a moan about
last year.

What it means is that we need _more_ code to support whatever
manufacturers come up in their scheme of things - rather than having
a standard way to represent these details, which software can parse
in a consistent way.

Instead, we have something that's effectively mandated to be present
but is basically useless because no software can parse it properly
without specific information from the manufacturer, and even then
its not guaranteed.

Well done ARM Ltd.  Again.

Stop doing this.
