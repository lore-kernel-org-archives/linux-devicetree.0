When we first started working on CoreSight programmable replicators
were available but the documentation wasn't public.  As such when I
saw Qualcomm's design I mistakenly thought it was a custom IP block
and came up with a compatible string that reflected that reality.
Fast forward 3 years the documentation is available and Juno has used
the same IP block in their design.  Suzuki's patch rectifies history
by changing the programmable replicator naming convention to what it
should have been from the start.

That being said, we can keep the old compatible string around but it
won't change anything.  CoreSight devices are discovered on the AMBA
bus and don't use the compatible string - drivers are probed based on
AMBA IDs laid out in the drivers and device IDs found in HW ID
registers.

In light of the above let me know what you want to do.

Thanks,
Mathieu
