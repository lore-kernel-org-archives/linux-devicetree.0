I take complete silence as no objection.

You keep combining the 2 changes. Please treat them differently.
I need ARM MHU doorbell changes as I need to support multiple channels
on my platform which are independent and run different protocol.
That doorbell change *is not SCMI* specific. I am not sure how to conver
that message to you. All my attempts have failed so far.

Why do you think so ? Please give me your understanding on what SCMI
specification expects as you seem to think we need to clone ?
All I am saying is we don't pass any information in the controller.
The current drivers just need a way to trigger the remote and I believe
all of them already have.

That's good to know.

I don't understand this.

Fine. We need to support them I am not saying that we don't. Please
answer my question above which I believe should reduce the confusion.

NO, I am saying again that I am not assuming that and you are the one
who is assuming MHU *must* work in the way the driver is written
currently and constantly/repeatedly ignoring the fact what MHY
specification states and mixing that change with SCMI here.

100%. You need to understand the fact that my changes makes it work with
SCMI and other protocol and MHU as it stands only work with whatever
platform you have with whatever client that supports.
