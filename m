Thanks for the hint, that sounds like the actual problem here,
If I represent the node with proper parent-child relationship like this, 
it will remove the need of this property and would work perfectly in 
case we want to support multiple ngds in future!

slim@91c0000 {
	compatible = "qcom,msm8996-slim";
	reg = <0x91c0000 0x2C000>;
	interrupts = <0 163 0>;
	dmas = <&slimbam 3>, <&slimbam 4>;
	dma-names = "rx", "tx";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ngd@1 {
		reg  = <1>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		codec@1 {
			compatible = "slim217,1a0";
			reg  = <1 0>;
		};	
	};
};



If you mean to provide consistent numbering to userspace, then

No, this is not problem am trying to solve.

It is passed as parameter to SLIMBUS_QMI_SELECT_INSTANCE_REQ_V01 request.
