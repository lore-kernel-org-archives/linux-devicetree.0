I believe this is the identical GPIO controller IP that is integrated 
into two different SoC chip variants. The only difference is the 
supported number of GPIO pins.

In this case, I believe this is what Linus prefers: 1) Using a single 
compatible string (tied to the GPIO controller IP); 2) Addressing 
difference in number of GPIOs using DT property 'ngpios'.

Thanks,
