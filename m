But that is exactly the point: While we try to ask the hardware about
anything that can be reasonably queried through an in-kernel interface
that talks to the hardware, it works less well when that hardware interface
is rather obscure and (like this one) only used on a few special machines.

Similar examples are Marvell's SoC ID register, which you have to read by
powering on the PCI host bridge and reading the Vendor/Device ID registers
for the root bus, or the 'nvram' on Broadcom's wifi router chips that is
in reality a partition on either NOR or NAND flash. Accessing those at
early boot from a random device driver is a real pain, and it would be
much nicer to have the boot loader read them and put the data into the
DT for us if we had the option. Unfortunately we have to deal with legacy
boot loaders that don't change the DTB.

Agreed. This also means that we need a way to access that register
anyway, and any discussion about finding a way to move the read
access for probing the device elsewhere is moot. A syscon device node
would probably be best, but the current approach also works.
