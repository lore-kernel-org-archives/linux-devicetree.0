Well, yes. If the DT doesn't correctly represent the hardware, things 
will probably go wrong; that's hardly a novel concept, and it's 
certainly not unique to this particular SoC.

There are several in-tree DT and code examples where devices are marked 
as disabled on certain boards/SoC variants/etc. because attempting to 
access them can abort/lock up/trigger a secure watchdog reset/etc. The 
only "special" thing in this particular situation is apparently that 
this device even allows its secure configuration to be probed from the 
non-secure side at all.

Implementing a boardfile so that you can "check" the DT makes very 
little sense to me; Linux is not a firmware validation suite.

Robin.
