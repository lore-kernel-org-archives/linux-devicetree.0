It is suitable. If other drivers would otherwise run into the data
reuse problem you have described, they can use the kmemdup solution
you have described.

Because I'm trying to get devicetree-driven HDD LED support driven,
and Grant stated that doing it this way is a hard rule:

"What is a hard rule is that the code creating the children needs to
know what the binding is and populate the child's of_node
appropriately."

I also confirmed that extending the mfd_cell layer is exactly what
Grant was suggesting:
http://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/devicetree-discuss/2011-September/008480.html

And Grant is undoubtedly a source of authority on device tree
implementation stuff.

So I seem to be stuck between two people giving me conflicting
requirements for merge of my work (which commenced in July, and has
already seen several discussions and rounds of patches). Any help
appreciated - I'm just trying to make a HDD LED blink.

Thanks,
Daniel
