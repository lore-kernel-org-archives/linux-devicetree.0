Thanks Mark!  The "#ifdef CONFIG_GENERIC_CPU_DEVICES" in cpu_dev_register_generic()
explains why we don't see the error on ARM, ARM64, etc.  Without the CONFIG
option, register_cpu(cpu, i) is not called.

Agree with Mark's request to update the commit message, and also
I would like to see this shaken out in the -next tree.
