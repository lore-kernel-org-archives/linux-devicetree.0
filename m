I think these are the custom properties which should be kept in your bi=

I dont see anything of these sort in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt .

Even I was using the bindings as used by samsung-keypad driver. But acc=

to the comments and logically too, we should use the common matrix keyb=

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/input/matrix-keymap.txt.
So that we can get rid of multiple bindings for different platform.
