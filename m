As I am trying to complete the list of clocks here my =93best=94 summar=
y
so far of the clock tree for the bcm2835 taken from various sources:
* Datasheet
* broadcom provided VC4 headers (via https://github.com/msperl/rpi-regi=
sters)
* mailing list

you can put in graphviz or http://www.webgraphviz.com/

I have no idea where we could put this information
in the kernel tree - maybe this would help.

=46rom this you can see that we have:
* PLL that is not configured now:
  * PLLB
* a few more PLL-dividers that are not configured:
  * PLLB_ARM
  * PLLB_SP0
  * PLLB_SP1
  * PLLB_SP2
  * PLLD_dsi0
  * PLLD_dsi1
  * PLLH_rcal
* a few clocks which Eric has said are wrong and where
  the corresponding parents need to get found:
  * ccp2 (gate)
  * dsi0pix (gate - maybe PLLD_dis0?)
  * dis1pix (gate - maybe PLLD_dis1)
  * pulse (gate)
  * td0
  * td1
* debug clocks that require a running debug power domain:
  * peria
  * sys
* missing clocks in the current driver:
  * aveo
  * cam0
  * cam1
  * ccp2 (see note above)
  * dtf
  * dpi
  * dsi0e   (maybe this also uses a different parent clock mux?)
  * dsi0pix (maybe this also uses a different parent clock mux?)
  * dsi1e   (maybe this also uses a different parent clock mux?)
  * dsi1pix (maybe this also uses a different parent clock mux?)
  * gp0
  * gp1
  * gp2
  * peria (see note above)
  * pulse (see note above)
  * slim
  * smi
  * td0 (see note above)
  * td1 (see note above)
  * td2 (see note above)
  * tec
  * sys (see note above)
* generic clock that is supposedly not in use

I can create a new patch that will include all those
missing clocks that are undisputed in their settings
(hence without any comments/notes) - I hope this is acceptable.

If someone has any ideas about those clocks where we=20
miss the correct parents/mux, then please add your
wisdom.
