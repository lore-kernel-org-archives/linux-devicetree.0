All Qualcomm platforms implements a shared heap among the processors in the
SoC, used for sharing data with other parts of the system.

One consumer of items from this heap is the "Shared Memory Driver", a ring
buffer based point-to-point communication mechanism used to send either stream
or packet based data to remote processors.

Starting with 8x74 this system is used to talk to the Resource Power Manager
(RPM), a power efficient "coprocessor" with responsibility of aggregate votes
from the various systems in the SoC related to regulators, clocks and bus
frequencies.

The PMIC regulators and root clocks in these platforms are only accessible via
the RPM, so to get access to these we need the full chain of smem, smd, rpm and
a regulator driver implemented. And that is exactly what this series provides.


A key outstanding question is where in the tree we should put the
implementation, for now I dropped them in drivers/soc/qcom but that's only
because I don't know where to put it otherwise. I have not found any equivalent
of the SMEM driver, SMD resembles mailbox and rpmsg - but comments in that
patch on why it's neither.

RPM is a mfd and regulator is a regulator :)


Part from the rpm regulators I've tested this by hacking up a firmware loader
and making some adoptions to the wcn36xx WiFi driver and I can indeed
communicate with this system as well. Missing for that part is the coupling
with remoteproc to reset smd channels when a remote system goes down.  But that
is indeed a separate set of patches.
