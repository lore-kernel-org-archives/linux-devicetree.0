Can you elaborate on this?

My thinking is that there should be a thermistor (or whatever else) 
driver,
that is a consumer of the regulator and a consumer of the IIO_VOLTAGE
iio channel and provides a new device with an IIO_RESISTANCE or 
IIO_TEMP
channel. Maybe there is a simpler solution, that I'm missing?

Actually I'm not 100% happy with the above solution myself, because if 
we
start supporting devices that act as an iio-multiplexer (some device 
that
is an iio consumer and provides many new iio channels and can control
via gpios which of it child channels is actually routed to the upstream
device) I don't know how to properly manage the regulator device.
However since this is only hypothetical ATM, I think we don't have to
worry about this too much.

Ok, so how do we figure out which boards these are?
I use this on the olinuxino and I guess all evaluation boards support 
the
use case too. The others I don't know enough about to be sure and I 
guess
it's not a good idea to just wait until somebody speaks up and 
complains
that the feature is missing on board X ...

Thanks,
Harald
