Yes, basically we have tow API to free list.
xgene_dma_free_desc_list_reverse will call if any failure in
allocation of memory from DMA pool in prep routines.
Like e.g. in prep routing we have some descriptors allocated and still
need to get descriptor to complete the DMA request and failure happen,
so we need to free all allocated descriptor.

I have confusion here, I don't see any driver dma buffer mapping in
prep_dma_memcpy.
Can you please clear me here if driver does this on behalf of client,
like any example so that I can proceed further.

Yes

So , basically we submit multiple descriptor to dma physical channel,
and dma engine execute it one by one and give us completion callback.
So in this way we expect callback on same order as submission order
and it does also, no issue.

But problem is with supporting p+q offload, here we have P
functionality supports in dma physical channel 0 and Q functionality
supports in dma physical channel 1. So for pq we need to submit two
descriptor, one to channel 0 and second to channel1, in this case we
can't expect the completion order, because channnel 0 can finish P
before Q or vice versa, and we need to wait to complete both before
calling client callback() and completing cookie.
Second thing we submit memcpy and sg on same channel, and can complete
before even though if it submitted after PQ.
