Good, because I believe that doing things without overlays will
be much easier. If you look at the actual implementation you will
see that it sets a lot of properties (touchscreen width, height,
inversion, axis-swapping, firmware-name) based on various sources,
the explosion of possible overlays from this is huge, and if
we're going to runtime patch the overlays then why use them at all
and not just runtime generate all the info ?

With "this" in "this node has to go", do you mean the node
with the "allwinner,sunxi-q8-hardwaremgr" compatible, or
do you mean the touchscreen template node ?

Nope q8 tablets come with A13, A23 or A33 SoCs, A23/A33 are pin
compatible with each other, but the A13 is not, this leads to
the touchscreen being on a different i2c bus, so I cannot hardcode
things, likewise the power-gpios and interrupt found in the
touchscreen node differ between the A13 vs A23/A33.

I actually had a touchscreen-i2c-bus property containing a
phandle to the i2c controller for the bus which has the
touchscreen in an earlier revision + touchscreen-gpios
and touchscreen-supply properties, I can switch to that
if you prefer that over having a touchscreen template node.

 > If not, of_find_node_by_name()?

Still a bit confused about what you do not like,
(touchscreen template node vs q8-hardwaremgr node).

I guess (based on context) you do not want the
q8-hardwaremgr node ?

So the q8-hardwaremgr code should activate based on
the machine compatible I presume? How does that
work with module autoloading ?

If you do not want the q8-hardwaremgr node and thus
no touchscreen property them yes I can use
of_find_node_by_name(), but I thought that was
generally frowned up on?

Only a few q8 tablets actually use the regulator, so
the hardwaremgr first tries detecting the touchscreen
without it, and only if it does not find anything then
tries with it, and adds a property to the touchscreen
node for it, but I guess I can do this other way
around and have it be present in the (incomplete /
template) touchscreen node and delete it from it if
not necessary.

That + using of_find_node_by_name() should indeed allow
me to remove the q8-hardwaremgr node. Assuming there is
an answer to the module auto loading, as I expect most
distros to build this as a module.

Hans
