I've mentioned my opinion on extcon before. The first clue that it needs 
work is a Linux subsystem name is used for the binding.

I think the connector nodes are on the right track, but of-graph doesn't 
work here because we already have a way to describe USB buses in DT. 
Following that, would something like this work for you? The vbus-supply 
and id-gpios are just examples and may not always be there like if the 
hub controls each port's vbus directly.

usb-controller@1234 {
	usb-switch@0 {
		compatible = "toshiba,tc7usb40mu";
		hub@0 {
			compatible = "some-hub";
			port@0 {
				compatible = "usb-A-connector"
				vbus-supply = ...;
			};
			port@1 {
				compatible = "usb-A-connector"
				vbus-supply = ...;
			};

		};
		connector@1 {
			compatible = "usb-ub-connector";
			vbus-supply = ...;
			id-gpios = <>;
		};
	};
};
