I'm willing to create a flattened tree.  I can provide both a client 
interface and a flattened tree.  The kernel probably won't use the 
client interface to any significant extent.

Way back in the misty annals of history, I dreamed of having a common 
interface between firmware and OSs.  That didn't happen.  Every OS 
insisted on defining its own interface and creating a custom bootloader, 
or in some cases a half dozen of them.
