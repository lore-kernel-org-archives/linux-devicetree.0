Not quite - dma-ranges is only valid for nodes representing a bus, so 
putting it directly in the USB device nodes doesn't work (FWIW that's 
why PCI is broken, because the parser doesn't expect the 
bus-as-leaf-node case). That's teh point of that intermediate simple-bus 
node represented by "periph_bus" in my example (sorry, I should have put 
compatibles in to make it clearer) - often that's actually true to life 
(i.e. "soc" is something like a CCI and "periph_bus" is something like 
an AXI NIC gluing a bunch of lower-bandwidth DMA masters to one of the 
CCI ports) but at worst it's just a necessary evil to make the binding 
happy (if it literally only represents the point-to-point link between 
the device master port and interconnect slave port).

Indeed it will, but those default masks were effectively only ever a 
best-effort thing anyway - it's an ease-of-implementation detail that 
bus_dma_mask is not currently reflected in the device masks, although we 
may eventually change that; the crucial part is that the DMA ops 
implementations know about it and should now enforce it properly 
regardless of whether drivers set something wider.
