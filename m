I've already stated in other thread that I want to see a significantly
better GPIO interface created. Something based on a char dev and can
handle 'bursts' of gpio manipulations/reads. I'm not going to accept
extensions to the sysfs interface.

Within that context I would consider named subsets of the same interface
that pre-packages a set of related gpio pins.

That said, I'm not convinced that direct gpio access is the abstraction
that you want. If it is an interface for, say, reading feature bits,
then it probably does want to be an actual driver that reads the
gpios/registers/adc/etc and returns the parsed status in a file. That's
the only way to reliably get the abstraction from your example above.
