These are basic device tree files needed to boot a SDM845 MTP
board to a ramfs based serial console shell

Bindings are based on whats proposed for pinctrl/serial/clock
drivers for SDM845 SoC
pinctrl: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10157143/ (This is now pulled
in by Linus Walleij for 4.17)
clocks: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/1/31/209 (under review)
serial: https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/cover/860251/ (under review)

'PATCH 3/3' is based on v2 of serial patches, will need an update if
v3 (still in the works) has further binding updates

Since 'PATCH 2/3' also adds an ITS node and keeps it disabled, we also depend
on https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/1/29/383

changes in v4:
* pull config changes to uart pins
* License in device tree files is still GPL-2.0

changes in v3:
* split the pinmux/pinconf nodes across SoC/Board files
* Fixes for issues reported with 'make dtbs W=2'
* other minor fixes based on review
 
changes in v2:
* dropped cpu-map
* dropped GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE()
* Added new cpu compatible for kryo385
* added ITS node, marked as disabled

Rajendra Nayak (4):
  dt-bindings: arm: Document kryo385 cpu
  dt-bindings: qcom: Add SDM845 bindings
  arm64: dts: sdm845: Add minimal dts/dtsi files for sdm845 SoC and MTP
  arm64: dts: sdm845: Add serial console support
