(you'd also need to handle the Thumb case; I digress...)

I concur.

The firmware is the only thing that really knows what's there,
and in reality there's no safe way to probe.  Even if we know we're in the
Normal World, we have no idea what's on the other side of SMC.  One
firmware's "probe" call may be another firmware's "halt and catch fire"
call.

So DT bindings permitting the firmware to tell us what's there make a lot
of sense.


Fleshing this out a bit...

Since the SMC and HVC instructions are features of the architecture, it may
make sense for the names to be:

	arm,smc = "vendor,interface-name";
	arm,hvc = "vendor,interface-name";

Some platforms may not fully service SMC on all CPUs, so there might be a
need to set this per CPU node.  This can be topologically determined, so
you might have:

	cluster@0 {
		arm,smc = "vendor,platform-basic-firmware";
		
		cpu@0 {
			arm,smc = "vendor,platform-fancy-firmware";
		};

		cpu@1 {
			// no arm,smc property
		};

		cpu@2 {
			// no arm,smc property
		};

		// ...
	}

The set of supported SMC calls on a CPU would then be determined by the
list of all strings on arm,smc properties on that CPU node and its
ancestors.

If the arm,smc or arm,hvc property is absent at all levels of the
topology, this does not mean that there is nothing there, but it does
mean that nothing is known about what's there.  Platform code would fall
back to the legacy case in that situation.


If additional properties are needed, like version or capability info,
we could have nodes instead:

	cluster@0 {
		arm,smc {
			basic-firmware {
				compatible = "vendor,platform-basic-firmware";
			};
		}

		cpu@0 {
			arm,smc {
				fancy-firmware {
					compatible = "vendor,platform-fancy-firmware";
					version = <1 12>;
					capabilities = "whizz", "bang", "kapow";
				};

				common-firmware {
					compatible = "standards-body,common-firmware";
					version = <1 0>;
				}
			};
		};

		// ...
	};

...or something equally esoteric.

(If node names like "arm,smc" are acceptable ... we could have something
else if not.)

It would be up to the platform's code handling "vendor,platform-fancy-
firmware" etc. to know about and deal with the precise calling
conventions for that firmware, though if there are generic firmware
interfaces someday, then those nodes' support code could be shared.
