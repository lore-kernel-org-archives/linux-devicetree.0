Right, that was really just an example. We have the general problem that
platforms have N timers and how do we assign them to clk source and clk
event. I'm fine with aliases if we decide that other options have issues
or are not worth the complexity. A "linux,X" property really needs to be
a last resort.

Then that is a "feature" of the h/w. So perhaps a "arm,timer-horked"
should be added as a property. Certainly wouldn't be the first timer
with that feature. :)

Yes, saving that information somewhere is useful.
