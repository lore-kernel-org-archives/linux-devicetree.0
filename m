Damn. No, you're right. I'll fix that. Thanks for the heads up, and
apologies for the shouting! ;-)

I do think that the moment you want to describe an interrupt (and have
the HW that can trigger one), you should end up describing this as a
real interrupt, and not as a "shake this pin" kind of thing.

The former gives you strong guarantees as to how this is going to be
processed, while the later looks like a hack to paper over missing
functionalities in past kernels...

Thanks,
