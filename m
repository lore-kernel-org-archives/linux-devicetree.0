We currently have two dma_map_ops variants on ARM (plus another set for
coherent/noncoherent differences, but we can ignore that for the sake
of this discussion): one that handles linear mappings and one that
handles IOMMUs by calling into the linux/iommu.h APIs.

I guess what you mean by 'a simple IOMMU driver' would be another
dma_map_ops implementation that is separate from real IOMMUs, right?

That could certainly be done, but in effect it is almost the same as
the linear mapping we already have.

The iommu dma_map_ops implementation does not need to worry about the
dma_pfn_offset. We are still debating how to represent IOMMUs in DT
at the moment, so it's not clear yet if we would consider a device node
with both a dma-ranges property and an iommu reference as valid.

What we will probably need is a way to represent the valid bus addresses
that can be used for transfers from the DMA master through the IOMMU.
This could be done through dma-ranges, or some other property, we will
have to decide that soon.
