I'll appologize in advance as I'm not sure I've understood you correctly, definately your answer
has given me a bunch more questions to clarify my understanding...

In the case of this particular node, then both reg properties refer to the syscfg_core address space
as both <0xf8 0x04> and <0xf4 0x04> are offsets into syscfg_core registers. So moving it under
the syscfg_core like you originaly suggested I believe would meet the definition of 'reg' ("describes the
address of the device's resources within the address space defined by its parent bus").

Or maybe you meant, if I want to keep the picophy node where it is (under soc), I need to stop using the reg
property?

The other problem I was describing is a device with some memory mapped registers and some
sysconfig registers you can find examples already upstream in stih416.dtsi file with the
ethernet0 and miphy365x_phy nodes.

Here the first 1/2 reg properties are expressed as a 32 bit physical address and size (meets the spec definition),
and the last is expressed as a sysconfig offset and size (which AFAIK doesn't match the spec definition).
This change in address space is however documented in the bindings documentation.

How should devices which have multiple address spaces ideally be handled?

>From looking around in the source I see a few different ways people have done this: -

1) Some drivers encode the data statically into the source and make a decision based on compatible string.
2) Some drivers add a couple of extra dt properties to encode the offset (spifsm in stih416)
3) Some drivers mix address spaces in the reg properties (examples given above) 
3) Probably some other ways I've not found yet

Is there a blessed way of doing this? It would be nice at least for all the drivers in STI to be doing
it the same as currently there seems to be a mix of implementations.

For the moment I think we can forget the third example in my previous email as it is currently hypothetical.

regards,

Peter.
