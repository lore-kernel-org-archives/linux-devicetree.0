version 5:
- rebase on top of timer/core branch
- rework commit message of the first patch

version 4:
- split patch in 3 parts
  - convert code to timer_of
  - only use 32 bits timers
  - add clocksource support

version 3:
- fix comments done by Daniel
- use timer_of helper functions

version 2:
- fix uninitialized variable

These patches implements clocksource and clockevent by using only one hardware block.
Getting both clock source and events on the same hardware lead to change quite
a lot driver code.
It also limits usage of clocksource to 32 bits timers because 16 bits ones
aren't enough accurate.
Thanks to timer_fo helpers this series includes minor clean up in structures,
function prototypes and driver name.

Since 16 bits timers become useless it also removes them from stm32f4 and
stm32f7 devicetree.

Increase min delta value to be sure to not have too much interrupts.
