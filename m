That's just not true.  I've explained why it's important for everyone
involved to see the bigger picture.  Let me use this set in an
example.  The patches can (and should) be applied separately, but they
are heavily entwined.  Let's say I only sent the ARM patch to Maxime
(the STi Maintainer) and only sent you the driver and the binding
document.  There's a chance Maxime could apply the DTS changes prior
to a proper review of the bindings.  Granted, one way round this would
be to place the DTS changes into a holding-pen until the binding has
been accepted, but this method is highly impractical and puts
unnecessary burden on the contributor.

There are 1000's of examples where all parties need to see reviews on
other, related but not dependant, parts of a set.  For many of the
sets I review it's critical for me what else is going on in related
diffs.  I guess for the subsystems you maintain it's less of an issue,
but still, it _is_ how people tend to submit code and there is no good
reason for you to dictate otherwise.
