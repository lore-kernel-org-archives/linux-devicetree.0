But when you have both atag and DT and the atag overrides the DT, that
means we have incorrect information in the DT, and code might later
rely on that information.

IMHO when we allow passing a DT to a kernel while booting from an
existing boot loader that only knows about atag, the code that loads
the DT should be responsible for updating the DT with the atag information,
not pass two conflicting sets of data into the actual kernel.

So we need to at least the command line and the memory layout to be adapted
in the in-memory DT, from the atags. Any other tags?
