I'm not sure you got my point. Yes, the drm_helper_disable_unused_functions() 
call should be removed from atomic drivers, but that will leave support code 
added for the sole reason of avoiding the crash in the drivers. That code will 
likely not be noticed and will stay there rotting. If we added 
drm_helper_disable_unused_functions() calls to all atomic drivers then driver 
authors will hopefully check carefully if there's any support code that can be 
removed when removing the function call. It would act as a kind of FIXME 
reminder.
