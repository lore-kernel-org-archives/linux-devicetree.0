Ah, right.  I exaggerated too much.

I want reset sub-system to support (1) nesting,  (2) enable_count.

To get these two features supported, the reset frame-work
would be similar implementation to the clock subsystem.
(In other words, we would duplicate effort
between clock and reset.)

Moreover, it is very common to control resets and clocks
from one hardware block.

So, I am looking for some idea that perhaps can unify the clock
and reset subsystems.


I found some SoCs implement reset drivers in drivers/clk.

mediatek/reset.c:       ret = reset_controller_register(&data->rcdev);
mmp/reset.c:    reset_controller_register(&unit->rcdev);

We can do that if needed.

I guess most of drivers would do similar things;
call devm_reset_control_get() && reset_control_deassert() in their
probe methods,
and reset_control_assert() in their remove methods.

I am wondering if we can do that somewhat automatically,
like the driver model framework automatically sets the pinctrl state
to "default"
(and low-level drivers are still able to change pinctrl state for the case
where multiple pinctrl states are supported.)


Another idea might be,
we can support "hogging" in DT just for de-asserting reset signals,


reset_ctrl: reset_ctrl {
        .compatible = "foo-reset-controller";
         #reset-cells = <1>;

         uart_deassert {   /* deassert UART reset automatically */
                reset-hog;
                resets = <0>;   /* index for UART reset line */
                deassert;
         };

         i2c_deassert {   /* deassert I2C reset automatically */
                reset-hog;
                resets = <1>;   /* index for I2C reset line */
                deassert;
         };
};
