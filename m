=46or that ID the soc_id attribute is actually much more appropriate.=20

But if anybody wants to use that as serial-number, fine. I'm not saying
we should prohibit that.

That is actually exactly my concern. We (Toradex) are a ARM module
provider which populate SoC's of different vendors. However, we would
like to keep consistency across modules. If a SoC vendor mandates to us=
e
the field for the SoC serial number, we end up with different serial
numbers in that field.

IMHO, the top level serial-number should be used for the board/device.

But if you don't like to define that, it is ok for me. But maybe we
could just mention soc_id as a possible alternative for SoC serial
numbers in the documentation?
