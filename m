That's pretty much aligned with my thinking.

Having said that I had wondered whether all TEEs would be prepared to
describe the set of available UUIDs since AFAIK UUID enumeration isn't
part of the GlobalPlatform standards so it is not implemented by GP
based TEEs (such as OP-TEE).

Is it feasible to extend OP-TEE to enumerate the available UUIDs?
If nothing else can it provide an (optional) pseudo TA to provide such a
service? Personally I'd be OK with a kernel TEE bus infrastructure that
mandated such a service (e.g. a TEE that does not provide the service
can only interact with TEE from userspace).


Daniel.
