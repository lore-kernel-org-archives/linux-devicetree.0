Hmm, a bit off topic question, does it work when the si5351 module gets
removed ? I can't see anything preventing clock provider module from being
removed why any of its clocks is used and clk_unregister() function is
currently unimplemented.

Doesn't deferred probing help here ?

Using different compatible strings to indicate multiple instances of same
hardware doesn't seem right. Unless LCD0, LCD1 are really different pieces
of hardware incompatible with each other I think it would be more correct
to use same compatible property and DT node aliases, similarly as is now
done with e.g. I2C busses:

	aliases {
		lcd0 = &lcd_0;	
		lcd1 = &lcd_1;	
	};

  	lcd_0: lcd-controller@820000 {
  		compatible = "marvell,dove-lcd";
		...
  	};


  	lcd_1: lcd-controller@820000 {
  		compatible = "marvell,dove-lcd";
		...
  	};

Hmm, was this custom binding intended or did you mean rather something
like:

  	&i2c0 {
  		si5351: clock-generator {
  			...
  		};
  		tda998x: hdmi-encoder {
  			compatible = "nxp,tda998x";
  			reg =<0x70>;
  			interrupt-parent =<&gpio0>;
  			interrupts =<27 2>;		/* falling edge */
  			marvell-input =<&dcon 0>;

			port@I {
				reg = <I>; /* input (or reg omitted completely) */
				endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&dcon>;
				};
			}
  		};
  	};
  	&lcd0 {
  		status = "okay";
  		clocks =<&si5351 0>;
  		clock-names = "extclk0";
  	};
  	&dcon {
  		status = "okay";
			
		port@A {
			reg = <A>; /* port A */
			endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&tda998x>;
			};
		}
		/* no connector on port B */
  	};

I think it should be tried to use common binding for common problems,
then a common parser library could be used, instead of repeating similar
code in each driver.

Hmm, not sure how that could work. IIUC there should be same number
of cells used in the clocks property for each clock specifier (clocks
provider's node #clock-cells), so &si5351 cell would need to be at
offset 4. Maybe there is some convention to specify null phandles but
I'm not aware of it.
