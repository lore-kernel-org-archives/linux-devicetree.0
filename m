To be able to use regulator to handle the overcurrent pin, i need to be able
to somehow retrieve the over current pin state from the regulator driver.

As i was trying your suggestion, i remembered why i thought i should use
mode instead of status: Status seems to be for internal regulator driver use,
there is no regulator_get_status, function and REGULATOR_STATUS_* are defined
in driver.h and not in consumer.h as  REGULATOR_MODE_*

it seems that status is only used to print sysfs info.

Would you be ok if i allow consumers to get the status via a new
"regulator_get_status" call?

Regards
Axel.
