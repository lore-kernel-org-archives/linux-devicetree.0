I don't quite get the issue. With the Intel hardware we only deal with 
Master registers (some of which mirror the bus state) in the handler and 
will only modify Slave registers in the thread. All changes to Slave 
registers will be subject to a timeout as well as a check for no 
response or NAK. Not sure what is specific about your solution that 
requires a different handling of commands depending on which device 
number is used. It could very well be that you've uncovered a flaw in 
the bus design but I still don't see how it would be Qualcomm-specific?
