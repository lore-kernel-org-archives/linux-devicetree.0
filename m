Right. Of course at the time, things were much simpler in general.

We have code in the kernel to handle power management and a couple of
very specific platform devices on ACPI based x86 and Itanium PCs. We would
use very little of that on ARM, and it doesn't do much of what we need
at the moment. We definitely shouldn't add all that infrastructure to
make it work on ARM just because someone accidentally put four letters into
a requirements document and didn't understand the consequences...

As I said, it really depends on what people actually want to do with
ACPI, and why they want it. I can see some scenarios in which it would
be fairly easy to do the conversion, such as when all the devices are
fixed in the SoC and you just need to map a couple of GPIO lines
or I2C devices. Doing the full conversion of an SoC structure otoh
would be pretty crazy.

True, I just think that's too many "if"s to build a product roadmap on.
It can turn into that in a couple of years, but anyone building a
complex SoC today is better off assuming it won't come to that IMHO.
