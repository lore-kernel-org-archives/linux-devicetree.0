"Dynamic region" is DMAble memory alloced using dma_alloc_xxx() APIs
for the device.

For DMA-capable devices accessed from user-space, we need DMAble
memory available to user-space. Sometime such devices are also
cache-coherent (or IO-coherent) so in such case user-space will need
cacheable DMAble memory.

Number of "Dynamic regions" required by UIO dmem device depends
on the type of HW device hence we describe number of "Dynamic regions"
and size of "Dynamic regions" via DT attributes.

They must be in DT for platform devices created using DT probing. The
number of "Dynamic regions" required by UIO device will depend on the
nature of device. We cannot have same number and sizes of "Dynamic
regions" for different UIO dmem devices.

The UIO dmem driver is a generic driver and not specific to any type of
HW. In fact, UIO dmem driver is generic enough to access variety of
platform devices from user-space using UIO framework.

Based on this Rob had previously suggested to not have any (or enforce
any) DT bindings for UIO dmem driver.

Refer, https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/18/457
Link to original Jan's patchset is https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/17/141

We had two options:
1) Get details of "Dynamic regions" via module parameter but this
would mean using same number and sizes of "Dynamic regions" for
all UIO dmem devices.
2) Pass names of DT attributes used by UIO dmem driver as
module parameters.

As explained above, we are not fixing DT compatible string and
DT attributes names for UIO dmem driver instead we pass all
these as module parameters (preferable via kernel args or at
time of module insertion). Due to this we don't require DT bindings
document.
