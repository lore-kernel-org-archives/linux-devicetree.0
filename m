It's not fixed yet, for now I've done a very draft that is a separate
gpio driver, but relies on the pinctrl_*gpio functions.

But since it's still at an early stage, if you have a better solution,
I'd be happy to follow it.

I'm used to the mxs syntax, so I based my work on it. But after a quick
look, it looks like the more recent pinctrl drivers like for bcm2835 or
mvebu use strings to give a much more readable dt.

I'll change that.

Ok, I will :)

It's not only pull-up/pull-down but also "drive levels". Since we don't
have any useful datasheet for these SoCs, we're not quite sure about
what this is really about except than it is related to the current of
the pin though (thus the "to be documented" in the documentation).

I didn't saw the pinconf-generic infrastructure, I'll switch to it.

You're right, will do.

Aaah, sorry, I forgot to Cc you in the second patch that adds precisely
this part of the driver...

Sorry again.

I'm not sure to understand what you mean here, but the sizeof is
definitely useless.

The bankid is just there for convenience for the device tree to make it
a bit more readable, but we could keep it in the driver I guess, it
would ease the registers address computing.

Of course, this is if we want to keep this syntax, which from your
previous comments, isn't what we want.

Retrieval of the data associated to the compatible, here the pins
available for the various SoC variants. This was in the patch I forgot
to Cc you, sorry about that.

I guess I could still make this a bit less ugly.
