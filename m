Sound very odd,
Can you check the xhci side if the data stage TRB in the control
endpoint ring still looks valid after endpoint reset?
That is, make sure that the data stage TRB still has DIR bit 16 set.

If something zeroed that TRB then the DIR bit it would be set to 0
which means DIR OUT.
Reset endpoint command forces xHC hardware to re-read the TRB from
memory  (i.e. the endpoint ring).
zeroing the trb could happen for example if the TRB gets turned
into a no-op.

This is already the intended workflow.
We should already queue a new Set TR Dequeue pointer if
we receive a transaction error on the TD the xHC is processing.
the whole control transfer (SETUP, DATA and STATUS) is one TD.

code flow when we receive a TRANSACTION_ERROR in finish_td:

xhci_requires_manual_halt_endpoint() // true due to transaction error
   xhci_cleanup_halted_endpoint(EP_HARD_RESET);
     ep->ep_state |= EP_HALTED;
     xhci_queue_reset_ep();
     xhci_cleanup_stalled_ring();
       xhci_find_new_dequeue_state()
       xhci_queue_new_dequeue_state()

what your code does different is that it skips the reset endpoint command.

It's also possible this is toggle/sequence number issue,
you could try issuing a EP_SOFT_RESET endpoint reset instead.
