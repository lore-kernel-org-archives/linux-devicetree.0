What does stable mean at this point? DTBs using the stable binding are
forever guaranteed compatibility with newer kernels? We really need to
define *exactly* what this implies for future support. More than likely,
most bindings will choose to stay experimental/testing indefinitely if
stable means a lifetime of ugly backward compatibility hacks.
