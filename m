Which is what we want -> less churn.

This needs to be CC to devicetree-discuss-uLR06cmDAlY/bJ5BZ2RsiQ@public.gmane.org where bindings
are discussed, the people there sometimes make a good job to make sure
the bindings are OS-neutral and stuff (doesn't seem like a problem in this
very case, but anyway).

Can you please be more elaborate on this mux-mask, like what each bit
means and why the bits are arranged like that and what it means on the
AT91 platform.... I was first reading the .dts and was like ?woot? so
I go to the bindings doc and I read this and I'm still like ?woot?..

This also need to be detailed so you can just read this and then
look at the numbers in the device tree and, "aha I get it!".

So please elaborate a bit on the three first members, so it's easy to read
and understand the device tree. I "sort of" understand it but better
be explicit.

Hm if we just add multidrive to <linux/pinctrl/pinconf-generic.h> we
could probably get this driver (and bindings) to use the generic
pinconf library in drivers/pinctrl/pinonf-generic.c as the coh901
currently does.

Actually multidrive makes me think that this is just shunting in
several MOSFET driver stages, which we *used* to have in
pinconf-generic, just by documenting that the argument passed
with parameter PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_PUSH_PULL
would indicate the number of drive stages if != 0.

Like this (old doc):

+ * @PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_PUSH_PULL: the pin will be driven actively high and
+ *     low, this is the most typical case and is typically achieved with two
+ *     active transistors on the output. If the pin can support different
+ *     drive strengths for push/pull, the strength is given in the argument
+ *     as the number of driving stages vs nominal load impedance, so say
+ *     quadruple driving stages (usually 8 transistors rather than two) will
+ *     be configured with the 8 passed as argument.

We're not mandate generic pin config because driver authors told me
repeatedly that their chips are very special (like everyone else, hehe)
but please keep it in mind as it could be hard to change this later.
I'd be happy to put back this piece of doc...

I still have a real hard time understanding what is happening here,

I understand that Pin 14 and 15 in pin bank 1 is connected to some
peripheral numbered 1 and pin 15 is pulled up.

I guess perioheral 1 is identical to debugf uart 0 or something
like that, since the node has this name? ut shouldn't this
peripheral number come from the fact that it's dbgu so there
is somewhere a table cross referencing ... or the device itself
has some node which is separate and has some name like
"pinctrl-periphid" or so?

Just trying to decipher this a bit so I see if I could maintain
it...

Would it be possible to have the periphid as a separate node
entry if it is anyway going to be the same value for all
pins, or is this number also unique per bank or something
like that, so debug uart would be say peripheral ID 5 on another
pin bank? (In that case, keep it like this.)

Richard said something about also selectong the AT91 driver which
seemed lika a good idea.

(There follow some changes moving a lot of IRQ domain stuff etc from
the GPIO driver which is hard to understand, but I guess you're doing
the right thing.)

As noted rely on switching on DEBUG_PINCTRL where needed.
It tags on -DDEBUG in the Makefile.

Hm, it seems this platform is not using SPARSE_IRQ ...

Nitpick should it not be named *gpio_chips[] (plural) since
there are several chips in that array?

I usually protect this kind of variables with a mutex but it
may be over-cautious.

So this I would have attempted to use pinconf-generic.[c|h] for
and use PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_UP and
PIN_CONFIG_DRIVER_PUSH_PULL with a specific
argument for the multidrive.

Beware that you may want to patch pinconf-generic.c
to get the debugfs output you want etc.

But as I said this is optional, just a good idea in general.

Are they all u32 really? I understand that they are u32 in the
devicetree but pullup seems like a candidate for a bool.

Reading below it seems the "mux" member should be some
kind of enum. Doing that an enum and documenting it seems
like it would solve other readability issues.

And this could actually use some kerneldoc too, if possible.

kerneldoc. Especually the two last functions are mysterious when just
looking at the struct.

(Then follows a block of really nice code...)

This print should actually output something interesting (if it helps)
maybe you could skip it?

DT parse code, looks nice but would request Stephen to have a look
at it.

I think most people use writel_relaxed() for this purpose (non-timeconsuming
register write) these days. So conside replacing all __raw_* with *_relaxed().

I have no clue whatsoever what is going on here, A? B? C? D?
Some small comment or something giving a hint about this grouping
system and how it works would be really nice.

This is nice, and one of the things we try to centralize and standardize in
pinconf-generic. However as I said that would be optional.

The last argument, "input" seems to be a bool.

Also not that this should maybe be named at91_mux_gpio_endisable()
since it is called from the disable() function below.

Looking at this it seems that the pin->mux variable should be an
enum so we get rid of these magic values 0,1,2,3,4. Documenting
these enums with kerneldoc would probably solve a lot of
questionmarks.

(Noted in the struct review above as well.)

Actually calling a function named "*enable" to disable something looks
quite unintuitive. Maybe rename that function to
"at91_mux_gpio_endisable()" or something?

Don't you want some nice debug output for each pin here?

I think this function is optional now, or it should be. So you shouldn't
need to define it.

Nitpick: checking the local variable pdesc for NULL is shorter.

This looks like a bool.

Especially if you use it like that...

"state" looks like a bool.

So I can see that this sets or clears bits in a 32-bit word per
bank. But I don't see these words being used for anything at all?

So what's the point of all this?

In  ux500 we have a register bit that enables wakeup on a
certain pin, then it makes all kind of sense to have this,
but what is this stuff, really? It seems the function can be
stripped down to two lines just calling irq_set_irq_wake().

This way of handling ranges looks very smooth, great that this works
for you!

The rest looks very good.
