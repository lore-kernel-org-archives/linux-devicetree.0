This provides initial patchset to support audio on
Qualcomm Techonologies Inc. SDM845 SoC. Currently, it supports
audio playback/capture over Primary MI2S and Quaternary
TDM ports.
Changes since v2:
- Added new file to parse dai-links from device tree
  and use it in sdm845 and apq8096 machine driver.
- Removed qcom prefix from device tree properties as
  suggested by Robb.
- Updated apq8096 machine driver to use common APIs.

  ASoC: qcom: dt-bindings: Add sdm845 machine bindings
  ASoC: qcom: Add support to parse common audio device nodes
  ASoC: qcom: add sdm845 sound card support
  ASoC: dt-bindings: Update dt binding name for apq8096
  ASoC: qcom: apq8096: Use common APIs to parse device nodes
