Yes, they need to be optional and you need to explain what the function
of these pins is so people can tell what they are.  As I said I really
do expect that the pin you have labelled headphone detect is really a
jack detect pin.

Yes, you certainly need to drop this patch.  There is no way of fixing
this with the current ALSA APIs, they are fundamentally racy and you
will always have the possibility of failures during simultaneous startup
for hardware with these limits.

Two things here.  One is that of course there's no reference counting on
FLL enables, they just happen, and the other is that as you'd expect the
bias level callbacks just won't happen for the second stream as the
device is powered up.  You only need to set the clocking up for the
first stream as the clocking can't be changed when the device is active.
