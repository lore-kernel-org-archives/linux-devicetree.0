I don't think we need the "earlydev" string at all, and can still keep
the rest of this infrastrcuture if it is helpful.

So while I'm certainly oppposed to the "earlydev" string, I think that
the infrastrcuture could be useful.

Can we have early_paltform_driver() take a reference to the driver's
of_match_table, and put that in a special section?

Then instead of looking for "earlydev", we look for any compatible
string in that section. No magic string required in the DT, and we can
always mess around with probe ordering in future.

IIRC we typically want to probe clocks before clocksources. Does using
early platform drivers ensure the necessary ordering?

Thanks,
Mark.
