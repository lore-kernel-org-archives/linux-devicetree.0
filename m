Let me ask then: Do we have a practical example where it's not 
sufficient practically?

To my understanding, Xen people have been happy with the 
"clk_ignore_unused" workaround since ~2 years, now [1]. And I think the 
"clk_ignore_unused" workaround does mainly the same like the patch 
discussed here. It doesn't care regarding clk_set_rate from changing 
properties, too?

While I agree that the patch theoretically incomplete, if nobody has a 
real world example I would think that from practical point of view it's 
sufficient in a first step.

If this is the case, I'd propose to fix the practical issue in a first 
step with a patch (this one) which is sufficient to fix the issues the 
Xen users have. And update the code for theoretical future issues in a 
second step.

Best regards

Dirk
