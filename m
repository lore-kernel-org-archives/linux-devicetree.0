That seems reasonable.

I'm slightly confused about how this part of the binding is structured.

I'd expect the label "pinctrl_usdhc4_1:" to point at the node "usdhc4"
here. As written, there's no possibility of using a different pin
configuration values such as pull/drive-strength/... for some of the
pins, which I'm pretty sure will be an issue.

For example, see tegra-cardhu.dts - it has a pull up on the SDMMC data
and clock lines, but no pull on the SDMMC command line. I assume it's
this way because of some aspect of the SDMMC specification, rather than
something odd about Tegra.

I guess you've allowed a list of mux functions in the fsl,mux property.
Perhaps you can also allow a list in the other properties.

In that case though, what is the top-level usdhc4 node for? Perhaps it
groups multiple different available pin configurations for the USDHC4
controller together just as documentation? I don't think it's that
useful to do that; it doesn't actually convey any extra information, and
the fact the node is a configuration for the USDHC4 controller is
readily apparent from the node's label and name.

If you use devm_pinctrl_get_select_default() here (once it's checked in) ...

... or that.
