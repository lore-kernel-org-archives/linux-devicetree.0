Yes, but with mailbox framework, the controller driver(esp. this one)is
almost like a shim layer. Instead of each driver adding these debugs,
IMO it would be good to have these in the framework.

Ok, I am not sure if that's entirely true because the MHU spec says it 
drives
the signal using a 32-bit register, with all 32 bits logically ORed 
together.
Usually only Rx signals are wired to interrupts and Tx needs to be polled
but that's entirely implementation choice I believe.

More over if it's protocol level agreement it should not belong here :)

Agreed but on contrary since MHU involves external firmware(running
on different processor) which might have it's own latency, I prefer
threaded over hard irq. And yes request_irq does evaluate to
request_threaded_irq but with thread_fn = NULL which is not what I want.

OK

In general secure accesses are avoided these days in Linux as we have no
way to identify it. I agree there are few place where we do access.
Even though I don't like you have secure channel access in Linux, you
have valid reasons. In case you decide to support it, there is some
restrictions in bit 31, though RAZ/WI you need to notify that to protocol
if it tries to access it ?

Not sure of this though. We need feedback from DT maintainers.
