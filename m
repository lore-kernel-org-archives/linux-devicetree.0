As pointed by Andrew, I planned to take them once the 4.15-rc1 would be
released. It was not obvious for me that it was real fixes. Actually I
would have expected to have first the dts fixed in a release and then
the warning enabled.

I am fine if you take this patch, especially if it is merged in
4.15-rc1.

So for this patch:

Acked-by: Gregory CLEMENT <gregory.clement-wi1+55ScJUtKEb57/3fJTNBPR1lH4CV8@public.gmane.org>

Thanks,

Gregory
