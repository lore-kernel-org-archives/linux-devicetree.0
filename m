Hi Rob, Frank, others,

Here's the 6th version of what used to be a single patch to prepare for
fwnode property cleanup.

Beyond this, I have a couple of other patchsets I'll post in the near
future:

- fwnode property cleanup (for linux-pm) which moves the property API 
implementation to FW specific locations; depends on these patches,

- V4L2 fwnode patches (for media_tree, no unmerged dependencies, pull
  request sent) and

- fwnode const patchset which allows making the fwnode argument for the 
  property API functions const. It depends on both of the previous sets.
  Might be for linux-pm.

since v5:

- Add "pr_fmt" macro missed when splitting base.c (1st patch).

- Add a missing newline (1st patch).

- Use parentheses around macro aguments (2nd and 3rd patch).

since v4:

- Add patch "of: Support const and non-const use for to_of_node()" to the
  set.

- Make nop is_of_node() and to_of_node() const-correct if OF is disabled.
  (since v4.1)

since v3: 

- Rebase the first patch (no conflicts),

- Add another patch for to make of_fwnode_handle() handle NULL argument 
gracefully.

  of: Make of_fwnode_handle() safer
  of: Support const and non-const use for to_of_node()
