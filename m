I'm the Fedora maintainer for the Raspberry Pi (and a lot of ARM on
Fedora in general).

With the upstream kernel, some DT bits headed upstream (ie the Fedora
kernel) plus these patches I get to the "kinda works" too in that it
sees a BT adapter but doesn't give it a mac address.

I've tried on and off to get the BT working, there seems to lots of
options and bits needed including some patches to the bluez [1] stuff
but between not quite upstream kernel bits and numerous distros all
doing it slightly differently I've never got it to work well.

The yocto [1] bits seem fairly representative of some the patches
flying around "to get it working" although I'm not sure how many of
these are actually required and how many are superfluous with this
patch set. There seems to be a firmware required that's not
distributed with linux-firmware which would also be nice to resolve.
