Fine. Seen examples of both in the kernel, but happy to remove it.

Used another driver as an example for this, but if there's a better method
then I'm happy to use it. Will have a look.

Fine. Will update.

I tested this on target, when doing tests for devicetree. What was happening was
that platform_get_irq_byname() was returning the VIRQ number already (368 in one
test case where onkey was being probed) rather than the local IRQ number for the
device (the resource information seemed to have been updated with the VIRQ
number instead of the local IRQ number). So when that was passed to
regmap_irq_get_virq() it would then return an incorrect IRQ number (0 in the
same scenario, when I enabled DEBUG in irqdomain.c, I would see the message
"error: hwirq 0x170 is too large for da9055_irq"). That incorrect irq was then
being passed to devm_request_threaded_irq() which subsequently failed. This is
why I made the change. Is it preferrable to use platform_get_irq_byname()
instead of regmap_irq_get_virq() as using them both doesn't seem to work, unless
I'm missing something fundamental here.
