Yes, this version of the controller which am working on does not have 
DPN_SampleCtrl2 register for SampleIntervalHigh Field and has registers 
for programming offset2 does indeed indicate that these ports are 
reduced ports.

However looks like new versions of the this controller does support full 
data ports.

I can add more flexibility in bindings by adding qcom,dport-type field 
indicating this in next version.

Yep, BlockPackingMode is missing. 1.3 version of this controller only 
supports Block Per Port Block mode.

I guess this can be derived with in the driver by using compatible 
string, I can add some notes in the binding to make this more explicit.
I will also reword offset1/2 description to include transport window 
within frame

Its 48x16 in this case.
