The IP does not provide an audio channel configured either as rx or tx.
I agree, that in such case, the cpu driver does not generally need
to worry about direction and there is nothing special required to handle it.

Here the IP provides 2 channels, 1 tx and 1 rx,  which may be active or 
not. The driver has to know which channel is used, and if both channels
have to be managed. The affected registers depend on selected channel. 
Moreover specific processing has to be performed if both channels are used.
