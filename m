If you have sg mode always enabled, but sg_list is size 1, that its
essentially a single

Btw SPI is a slave case, not a memcpy!

Read will be another transfer, perhpas sg lnegth = 1

I kind of don't agree to that!

Not for memory copy

No it doesn't make it generic API. With generic API the IP should be usable
with any generic interface without specfic hoops to go thru. People are
going to test upstream dmatest on your IP and find it not working or
degraded perf, so better stick with generic API.
