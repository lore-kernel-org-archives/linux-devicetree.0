No, PLLs don't share register any more. You can find what all clock nodes will
look like in:

I represented the HW by "kind", for example, gateclks, common-clks, pllclk.
And let common PLLs follow this rule as well:

one node for all common plls

reg <0x922000 0x14>, <0x940034 0x14>, <0xea0200 0x14>

OK. As you said, "SoCs just dump some functions into a bunch of registers with
no particular order", BG4CT is now cleaner, all common-clks are put together,
gate-clks are put together, pllclks are put together, only the common PLLs
are dumped here and there. So how about representing the HW by "kind", one
node for common plls, one node for gateclks, one node for common clks and 
one node for pllclks?

                pll: pll {
                        compatible = "marvell,berlin4ct-pll";
                        reg = <0x922000 0x14>, <0x940034 0x14>, <0xea0200 0x14>
                        #clock-cells = <0>;
                        clocks = <&osc>;
                };

		pllclk: pllclk {
                        compatible = "marvell,berlin4ct-pllclk";
                        reg = <0xea0710 4>
                        #clock-cells = <1>;
		};

                gateclk: gateclk {
                        compatible = "marvell,berlin4ct-gateclk";
                        reg = <0xea0700 4>;
                        #clock-cells = <1>;
                };

                clk: clk {
                        compatible = "marvell,berlin4ct-clk";
                        reg = <0xea0720 0x144>;
                        #clock-cells = <1>;
                        clocks = <&pllclk SYSPLLCLK>;
                };
