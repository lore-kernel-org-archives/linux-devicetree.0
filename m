Ah, ok. I see.

I had thought that it is the right thing to do like devm_gpiod_get_optional().

That one it is described as:

"* This is equivalent to gpiod_get(), except that when no GPIO was assigned to
 * the requested function it will return NULL. This is convenient for drivers
 * that need to handle optional GPIOs."

Seems to be inconsistent definition of what "optional" means.

So we indeed should use devm_regulator_get() in this case. Thanks for pointing out!

Ok, then it should just be defined in the bindings but not used by the driver?

BR and thanks,
