The issue this patch tries to solve is not about single devices, but
about the way these devices are connected with each other.

Clocks for different (sometimes completely unrelated) devices influence
each other. You can't control the clock from one device without
influencing other devices. Knowledge about these constraints can't be
encoded in the drivers, because the constraints differ per SoC,
sometimes even per board. Many SoCs share the same devices, but the
clock topology they are surrounded with is always different. With this I
don't mean the direct clock inputs, these are well abstracted with the
current clk_* API.  What I mean is situations like: "On this board use
the clock controller to output this particular clock on that pin,
because it happens to be the master clock of some audio codec connected
externally; also make the same clock input to the internal Audio system
to make sure both are in sync". These situations can be completely
different on the next board or on the next SoC which has the same
devices, but a different clock routing.

That said, I also think the driver core doesn't have to be bothered with
the clock setup. Putting the clock setup into the devicenode providing
the clocks (and thus parsing it from the clock controller driver) should
be sufficient.
