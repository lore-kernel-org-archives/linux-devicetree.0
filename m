I *thought* that when a plugin is used the format conversion code was disabled.
But I'm not sure.

The whole problem is that we still don't have a decent plugin for an MC driver.
There is one for the exynos4 floating around, but it's still not accepted.

Companies write the driver, but the plugin isn't really needed since their
customers won't use it anyway since they make their own embedded driver.

And nobody of the media core developers has the time to work on the docs,
utilities and libraries you need to make this all work cleanly and reliably.

As mentioned, I will attempt to try and get some time to work on this
later this year. Fingers crossed.

We also have a virtual MC driver floating around. I've pinged the author if
she can fix the last round of review comments and post a new version. Having
a virtual driver makes life much easier when writing docs, utilities, etc.
since you don't need real hardware which can be hard to obtain and run.

Again, I agree completely with you. But we don't have many core developers
who can do something like this, and it's even harder for them to find the time.

Solutions on a postcard...

BTW, Steve: this has nothing to do with your work, it's a problem in our subsystem.
