I just had a look at them, and I think the case is different here:

For the two bcma driver, there is a discoverable bus (bcma) rather than
the platform bus, and it only exposes one device, so the bcma-hcd driver
is actually needed so we get two device that can be bound to the regular
drivers.

For the ssb-hcd driver, it's less clear and that one could be
reworked into two separate drivers.

Right. We are trying to  gradually move some of them over to use the
generic *hci-platform.c drivers though.

Ok, good. Please see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/usb-?hci.txt
then. You might actually be able to just use the existing drivers
without new code by just adding the proper DT nodes that follow these
bindings.

Ok.
