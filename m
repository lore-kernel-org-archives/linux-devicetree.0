Hi everyone,

This is v2 of my A83T I2S and I2C support series.

Changes since v1:

  - Dropped ASoC patch that was merged
  - Added SoC-specific compatible strings for I2C controllers
  - Added Maxime's Acked-by

This series adds support for I2S and I2C on the Allwinner A83T SoC.
The I2S controllers are similar to the ones found on the A31. However
the TX FIFO and interrupt status registers were swapped around. This
seems to be a recurring theme for the audio related hardware blocks.

Patch 1 adds device nodes and default pinmux settings for the I2S
controllers.

Patch 2 adds device nodes and default pinmux settings for the I2C
controllers.

Patch 3 is an example of a PCM5122 codec tied to I2C2 and I2S1 over
the GPIO header of the Banana Pi M3. This patch should not be merged.

Please have a look.

Regards
ChenYu
