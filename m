The hardware updates a read pointer (rdaddr) which we feed to ALSA via=20
the ".pointer" hook. So yes, the hardware does have a register that=20
tells us its progress.  This routine (ringbuf_inc) actually updates a=20
write pointer (wraddr) which is a misnomer.  The write pointer doesn=92=
t=20
actually tell us where we are writing to =96 ALSA keeps track of that.=20
The wraddr only prevents the hardware from reading past it.  We just us=
e=20
it, along with a low water mark configuration register, to keep the=20
periodic interrupts firing.  The hardware is tracking the distance=20
between rdaddr and wraddr and comparing that to the low water mark.

Being late processing the interrupt is okay since there are more sample=
s=20
to read.  That is, it was only a low water mark interrupt and we have=20
one period of valid data still (we configure low water to be one=20
period).  Missing an interrupt is okay since the hardware will just sto=
p=20
reading from the ring buffer when rdaddr has hit wraddr.
