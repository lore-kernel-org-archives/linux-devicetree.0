Maybe we are looking this in the wrong way.

AMBA is not really the bus, but certain types of devices on the bus. 
Granted, it may actually be an AMBA bus vs. vendor bus (i.MX AIPS), but 
that is really transparent to s/w. Separating AMBA devices in the 
devicetree is really Linux requirements defining the devicetree 
structure. It is certainly conceivable that an OS could make no 
distinction. In my case, there is a mixture of regular platform devices 
and AMBA(Primecell really) devices all interleaved on the same bus.

Based on this, I think of_platform_populate should always just match 
against "simple-bus" and make the matches parameter define the device 
creation hook rather than the bus type. Or you could have both 
bus_matches and dev_matches parameters.
