Bu in that case the controller does not know what it actually should do
with the sampling information alone either...

Where is that code handling that today? sample_edge has been added, but
I only see setup_time_ps being used in pl111_display.c.

I'm not a hardware guy, but according to my rough calculation a pixel
clock signal at 100MHz would need to be 1.5m off compared to the data
signals to skew by a half period! Length matching is usually only
necessary at really high speed signals. Is that really what is going on
here?

Why not just work around by specifying "the wrong" edge...?
