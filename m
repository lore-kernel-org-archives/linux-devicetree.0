That is the tip of a much larger problem that we don't have any good way
to solve. There is no dependency tracking beyond the nature Linux driver
model tree. For example, the removal of a GPIO driver has no way to
tell users that it is going away, and so there is no way to force a
driver remove when it happens.

If we created a managed api for requesting resource (ie.
devm_request_gpio()), then it would be possible for the gpio core to
force a remove event on any driver that doesn't have the ability to
gracefully handle a remove.

The exact same problem exists for IRQs, clocks, regulators, or pretty
much any cross-tree dependency.  :-(

Indeed, it is a completely different operation.
