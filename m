Umm, I'm the maintainer for TDA998x:

NXP TDA998X DRM DRIVER
M:      Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>
S:      Supported
F:      drivers/gpu/drm/i2c/tda998x_drv.c
F:      include/drm/i2c/tda998x.h

It would be nice if people worked with the actual maintainers of things
rather than random other people...

No.  I added the component helpers, which are entirely firmware agnostic.
The media bindings were created by others, and through development done
by Pengutronix, they were factored out of media into common DT code and
re-used for the IMX DRM driver.  The binding document which describes
that work is not the one you refer to above, but this one:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt

This started them as a basis for DRM drivers on ARM - but it's never been
officially "adopted" as a method to describe DRM drivers - it's only what
some drivers are using.  It ought to be nailed down as a way to ensure
inter-operability between components though, but no one has really made
that decision.

Jean's proposal to add audio support to the TDA998x driver does it via
this change to the binding spec:

+Optional nodes:
+
+  - port: up to three ports.
+       The ports are defined according to [1].
+
+    Video port.
+       There may be only one video port.
+       This one must contain the following property:
+
+       - port-type: must be "rgb"
+
+       and may contain the optional property:
+
+       - reg: 24 bits value which defines how the video controller
+               output is wired to the TDA998x input (video pins)
+               When absent, the default value is <0x230145>.
+
+    Audio ports.
+       There may be one or two audio ports.
+       These ones must contain the following properties:
+
+       - port-type: must be "i2s" or "spdif"
+
+       - reg: 8 bits value which defines how the audio controller
+               output is wired to the TDA998x input (audio pins)
+
+[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt

(That's not a particularly precise definition, but it's what we have at
the moment.)

Right now, the TDA998x will ignore the additional information, but that
won't be the case with Jean's audio work (see the above binding
information.)
