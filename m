Ok, fair enough.

We've already added a significant number of reset drivers like this,
I guess it doesn't hurt to have one more. We have so far resisted
adding a register state machine to DT.

There are two reasons for using IS_ENABLED: the first is that it catches
both the =y and the =m case in Kconfig, which doesn't apply here since
the cache controller driver cannot be a loadable module.

The other is that you can replace the #ifdef with an if(), to improve
readability and compile time coverage, but you didn't do that.

I think we just did, not sure if the patches have made it into linux-next
already, but there were a couple of other platforms already that want this
directory.

We can always improve the code.

Ok, let's try that. It would be good to have some insight from somebody
who understands the architecture though.

>From reading the code, I understand that

* On ARMv7, we always treat memory as bufferable, dma_alloc_coherent()
  uses L_PTE_MT_BUFFERABLE just like dma_alloc_writecombine does,
  and the mb/rmb/wmb macros flush the write buffers as needed.
* On ARMv5, we never treat dma_alloc_coherent() memory as bufferable,
  and the mb/rmb/wmb macros do not need to flush the write buffers.
* On ARMv6-only kernels we allow the user to pick the behavior at
  compile time.
* The code above for Realview was introduced by this commit:

    ARM: 6202/1: Do not ARM_DMA_MEM_BUFFERABLE on RealView boards with L210/L220
    
    RealView boards with certain revisions of the L210/L220 cache controller
    may have issues (hardware deadlock) with the mandatory barriers (DSB
    followed by an L2 cache sync) when ARM_DMA_MEM_BUFFERABLE is enabled.
    The patch disables ARM_DMA_MEM_BUFFERABLE for these boards.

This means that in a kernel that supports one of these three realview
variants, we shouldn't enable this option, but that in turn will break
any ARMv7 machine supported by the same kernel. This is bad. Not
setting ARM_DMA_MEM_BUFFERABLE will break with MACH_REALVIEW_DT on your
PB1176, which is also bad.

Maybe Catalin remembers the exact nature of the deadlock so we can come
up with another solution. If I read the original patches correctly, the
dsb() wasn't a problem, but the outer_sync() was. Maybe we can do
an alternative implementation for outer_sync() for the affected machines
that avoids the deadlock?
