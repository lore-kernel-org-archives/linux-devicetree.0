That function is only compiled when ARM_RECOM_STATE_ID_ENC is true,
which it isn't when I build TF using "make PLAT=fvp ...." so I think
it's a red herring.

When I boot the FVP with my posted device-tree, the core run state icons
on the CLCD window behave as you would expect for CPUs and whole
clusters powering off/on as CPU's activity changes. So idle _looks_ like
it's working OK.

I also put printfs in ATF's psci_cpu_suspend() function and I can see
the values specified in device-tree being passed in and the code
behaving sensibly. From how it cracks the power_state value [4] it
certainly looks like the numbers have the following meanings:

top byte = 0..3 for the 'level' of the power state
top-but-one byte = 0/1 for Standby/Powerdown

For FVP [5], the level appears to be 0=CPU, 1=Cluster.
This matches what's in the device-tree I posted, where we have
0x00010000 for CPU sleep, and 0x01010000 for cluster sleep.

All of which is a long way of saying that I believe the values that the
firmware guys and Linaro have been using for the past year or two are
correct ;-)
