I wasn't making a specific requirement here on whether you have that
in the mbus ranges or not, but if you put it in there, you have to adapt
the contents as above.

As I explained on IRC, there is no requirement to pick a specific bus
aperture. The only two sensible choices are to make the bus address
the same as the CPU address, or to make the bus address start at 0,
which is what this does.

This patch is needed only if you change the ranges to have the bus
aperture start at 0. However, if we pick a different way to specify
the aperture than putting it into both ranges properties, that point
is moot, since you wouldn't use of_pci_range_to_resource here
anyway.
