I agree with Tomi here. Lets keep the soc part number in the compatible
string. More often than not, some undocumented, undiscovered issue pops
up over time. Its much safer to have the SoC revision in there.

Per me, compatible property is an ordered list precisely for the reason
that things should continue to "work" with as closely matched driver as
possible. So even if someone is running a kernel which does not
recognize "ti,da850-tilcdc", it should still be able to probe the driver
based on "ti,am33xx-tilcdc" and provide as close to full functionality
as possible.

That said, I will not insist on keeping it around if Tomi is
uncomfortable. And having read the binding documentation accepted by
Jyri, it actually says the compatible property should be __one of__
"ti,am33xx-tilcdc" or "ti,da850-tilcdc".

Thanks,
Sekhar
