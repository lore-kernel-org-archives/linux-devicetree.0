I think how this is getting used by the driver is wrong. 
{src,dst}_addr_widths are supposed to be a bitmask of supported slave 
device register widths. You aren't doing a bitmask and you are also 
saying you only support slaves with 8 or 16 byte data registers which is 
somewhat rare. It may happen to work because 128/8 == BIT(4). However, 
the documentation for the field is contradictory in that it says 1,2,4 
or 8 byte widths are supported, but the enum has more sizes.
