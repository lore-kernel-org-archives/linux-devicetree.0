List-Id: devicetree@vger.kernel.org

As reported in [1], rename the k2* dts files to keystone-* files
this will force consistency throughout.

Script for the same (and hand modified for Makefile and MAINTAINERS
files):
for i in arch/arm/boot/dts/k2*
do
	b=`basename $i`;
	git mv $i arch/arm/boot/dts/keystone-$b;
	sed -i -e "s/$b/keystone-$b/g" arch/arm/boot/dts/*[si]
done

NOTE: bootloaders that depend on older dtb names will need to be
updated as well.

Based on next-20160316
Ignored:
 - all the build warnings reported in http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg490058.html
 - k2g* files which for some reason appears in linux-next, but not part of pull request:
