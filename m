Hi Arnd,

I'm sorry I did not find any relevant registers in the docs or source code describing
it in a specific block of registers, and no close enough register definitions either.
They may be used by the secure firmware I imagine.

For the register name, Amlogic refers it to "cpu_version" in their code, but it really
gives some details on the whole SoC and package, and socinfo seems better.

Neil
