Improving constraint functionality would certainly help, however the way 
that code works is beyond my understanding and I do not believe such an 
improvement would be coming from anybody else any time soon either.

I agree with that. However, the simple-card binding goes already now 
quite a bit beyond just describing the hardware. The binding for 
instance decides the configuration that is going to be used over the 
dai-link. These constraints could be seen as an extension to that 
configuration.

I am wondering if there would be some better way to select the dai-link 
configuration than writing it to DT or creating a custom machine driver 
for each setup.

But about this patch. Should I just give it up, or would you be willing 
to apply it if I improve the description more and add a warning against 
using these properties to work around driver bugs to the binding document?

Best regards,
Jyri
