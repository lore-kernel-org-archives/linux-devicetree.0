IMO, yes.

I think I mentioned this already, but I expect that this is going to 
cause a number of conversions of dtsi + dtsi -> dtb into base dts and 
overlay(s) dts files. In doing so, we still need to be able to build the 
original, full dtb.

Why? How is the kernel better?

I'll tell you up front, I'm not a fan of FIT image (nor uImage, 
Android boot image, $bootloader image). If you want a collection of 
files and some configuration data, use a filesystem and a text file.
