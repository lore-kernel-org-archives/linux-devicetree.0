Yes, in general if you specify a value in DT that can be probed, its
usually to override the probed value(useful if there is some h/w errata)...

... however if you incorrect values by mistake, then it's problematic
even if h/w provides correct value.

Same there, IIRC PPC use them, but on ARM I think so far the need has
not arise.

Just to re-iterate myself, I am not against adding them, but it's not
really needed. I just wanted to know if there was any h/w issue.
