Looking at Table 2-2. MCU Domain Memory Map in TRM, OSPI has similar
need. There are two address ranges to access OSPI flash in memory mapped
mode:
MCU_FSS0_DAT_REG1 0x0050000000 0x0058000000 128 MB(32bit space)
MCU_FSS0_DAT_REG0 0x0400000000 0x0500000000 4 GB(64bit space with ECC)
MCU_FSS0_DAT_REG3 0x0500000000 0x0600000000 4 GB(64bit space w/o ECC)

Since, there are already OSPI flashes with size > 128MB, we would need
to use 4GB address space in kernel (which is above 32 bit space)

Therefore, could you also change cbass_mcu also to have
#address-cells = <2>?
