ZynqMP is one example that immediately comes to my mind. I'm sure there 
are others too.

In general it's very frustrating to debug what goes wrong when you can't 
even get serial to output anything at all just because there are now 
pinctrl bindings that your kernel may not know about yet. I've run into 
that too many times.

I don't see how setting them to bool contradicts with the hack? The goal 
of this patch is to allow systems to load drivers on firmware provided 
pinctrl setups if there is no matching pinctrl driver in the kernel.

The key point is not to regress. Imagine you have firmware 1.0 which 
works with OS 1.0. Firmware provides the device tree.

When you update to firmware to 1.1 you want to make sure OS 1.0 still 
works. The bug you're referring to that existed before of course still 
exists. But we're not worse off.

Again, it's about regressions. If audio didn't work before, a firmware 
update may not get you working audio with OS 1.0. But it may enable OS 
1.1 to provide audio.
