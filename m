I agree that the inconsistency is not great.

However, I think that we do not want the kernel to accept FDT_SW_MAGIC
in any case, given this implies a DTB mid-creation.

Which is to say that either fdt_check_header() is doing the wrong thing,
or that we're using it in places where it's inappropriate.

Note that fdt_create_empty_tree() calls fdt_finish(), which fixes some
details up, then sets the magic to the real FDT_MAGIC.

So that should be fine.

Thanks,
Mark.
