I'm also seeing that we also call early_platform_cleanup() from
platform_bus_init(). Any ideas for this one?

I'm afraid I don't quite understand your reasoning. I fully agree that
devices that need to be initialized that early are a rare corner case.
We should limit any such uses to the absolute minimum. But when we do
need to go this way, we should do it right. Having a unified mechanism
for early devices will allow maintainers to enforce good practices
(using resources for register mapping, devres, reusing driver code for
reading/writing to registers). Having initialization code in machine
code will make everybody use different APIs and duplicate solutions. I
normally assume that code consolidation is always good.

If we add a way for DT-based platform devices to be probed early - it
would be based on platform device/driver structures anyway. Why would
we even want to not convert the board code into a simple call to
early_platform_device_register() if we'll already offer this API for
device tree?
