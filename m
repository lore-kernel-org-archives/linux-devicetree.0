Do you mean by having the below in some place like function
imx31_soc_init()?

#ifdef CONFIG_SND_MXC_SOC_AUDMUXV2
	imx_add_platform_device("audmux-v2", 0,
		audmux_res, ARRAY_SIZE(audmux_res), NULL, 0);
#endif

I do not think it's nice and consistent to the way that imx
sub-architecture adds platform device.

Furthermore, when a DT based board boots here, the code is broken.
Explicitly adding the device by individual board as needed can easily
align with DT based boards.  By default, the audmux node in <soc>.dtsi
file has status = "disabled", and any board that needs audmux device
only need to overwrite status property of audmux node as 'okay' in its
<board>.dts.  Then DT core will add the audmux device when the board
boots.
