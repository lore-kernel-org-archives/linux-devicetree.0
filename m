You can define your own property names.

What's implemented in Linux should not define the binding. The binding
should describe the hardware.

It's basically ON, OFF, and "ON in run/OFF in wfi".

Perhaps the iMX case is unique enough we don't try to make it use a
common binding.

True, but not your problem to implement. A binding doesn't necessarily
mean there is a full Linux implementation. We just don't want to create
something only to find others need something completely different.
