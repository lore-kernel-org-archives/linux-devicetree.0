As Rob says, it's documented in ePAPR.

We could merely add an empty dma_mask u64 to the containing struct
platform_device and then assign the pointer to dev.dma_mask if it is
needed.  That would eliminate the malloc.  Or we could by default
use dev->dev.dma_mask = &dev->dev.coherent_dma_mask;  Drivers or
notifier code could override whatever we setup here as the default.

dma-ranges really is the property that should be used for this, but
dma-ranges can describe a different set of permutations than dma_mask.
The former can have any number of valid DMA windows, but dma_mask
is based on per-address-line values.  (The whole dma_mask approach
appears insufficient to me, but I don't understand all the background
details as to why it is implemented that way).

I'd like to avoid defining a new mechanism for describing the valid
dma layout if at all possible.  This could be done with a new function
to fetch and parse each of the dma-ranges tuples and extract the
intersect of the ranges.  It will never be a perfect translation,
particularly because RAM doesn't start at 0 on a lot of platforms.

So, let's call the base of ram X, and the top of ram X+S.  Then let's
assume that dma_mask is intended to filter out high address (instead
of broken DMA low addresses) and that the DMA limitations are based
on attached address lines, not arbitrary start-end addresses, so if
we let number of address lines be 'A', then dma_mask = 2^A-1
(ideally).  Individual bits could also be blanked out, but what that
really means in a practical sense is that those address lines must be
0.  There isn't a way to constrain address bits that must be set to 1.

Okay, so if we assume that linux will never choose a dma address below
X (because there is no RAM there; except in the iommu case which can
put dma addresses where it needs to regardless), then we only need to
worry about the upper range for a device.  We could derive a dma_mask
by calling of_translate_address on the base address of each dma-ranges
tuple and finding the one that starts at or below the base of memory.
Then the default dma_mask can perhaps be calculated thusly (using 'Y'
for top of the chosen dma-range tuple):

	dma_mask = (2 ^ fls64(Y)) - 1;

Alternately, we could simply decide to do as you suggest and define a
dma-mask property because that approach is sufficient for a lot of
hardware and is therefore is a reasonable binding.

Thoughts?
