Can you find out the answer to this?

I'm not asking you to put the version number in the dt if it can be read
from a register.  I'm asking you to have the binding describe the
version register, as part of the definition of what "fsl,qoriq-usb3-phy"
means.

Then the device tree node needs to say what endian it is, and you need
to choose the appropriate accessor at runtime.

But is it really big endian for most or even any SoCs?  This hardware
isn't present on our PPC chips, right (I checked a couple of the most
recent PPC RMs and it shows USB 2.0 only)?  So it'd just be the few ARM
chips that made almost everything big endian, and even there the couple
RMs I checked (ls1021a and ls1043a) have these registers described as
little-endian.

My point is that the device tree node should be complete when you submit
it.  Don't wait for the implementation of a workaround to advertise the
existence of an erratum in the device tree.
