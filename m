Thanks for pointing this out. I looked into this a bit. I see some
difficulties in adopting SPD for our needs.

1. Our primary target is LPDDR2 and I can't seem to find an SPD
standard for LPDDR2. Maybe, because automatic memory detection is not
that critical in the embedded world.

2. I did find one for DDR SDRAM memories(Appendix D, Rev 1.0 - maybe
for the first generation of PC DDR memories). But many of the AC timing
parameters needed to program our controller are not listed in it.

3. We do not really need DDR3 support at the moment because we do not
intend to scale DDR frequency in platforms with DDR3 memory. This is
due the to limited operating frequency range of DDR3.

So, I was wondering whether I should limit the binding to only LPDDR2
and have an SPD based binding for DDR2/DDR3 if that is required later?
What do you think?

As pointed out by Tony we rely on bootloader for the initial SDRAM
configuration. The kernel SDRAM controller driver is used mainly for
DVFS and thermal management.
