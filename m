Hmm. This information is related to the video signal captured from the 
host. That information has nothing to do with the buffer that is 
compressed and grabbed by the driver and ultimately provided to 
userspace. Isn't the timing information meaningless for JPEG frames?

Forgot to include this question in my previous reply, sorry for the 
additional mail.

Thanks,
Eddie
