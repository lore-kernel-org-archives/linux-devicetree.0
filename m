There is currently no accepted way to configure constraints->valid_modes_mask
for regulators defined in device tree.  This patch series defines a new
common regulator device tree property, regulator-allowed-modes, which can be
used to specify the set of modes that the regulator is allowed to use.
It also implements parsing for this new property inside of the
of_get_regulation_constraints() function.

  regulator: of: add property for allowed modes specification
  regulator: of: add support for allowed modes configuration
