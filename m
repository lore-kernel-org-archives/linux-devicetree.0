Well, there are more submitters than reviewers and maintainers and we
have travel and vacation (aka lives).

DT is software's view of the hardware. Firmware provides interfaces to
the OS just like a h/w device does. And just like h/w devices, the
firmware is not discoverable and needs to be described. Originally, DT
was the firmware's interface to the OS with OpenFirmware.
