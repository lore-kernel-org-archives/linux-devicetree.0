I'd also agree with the second half of what you said.

Let's take an example.  If a .dts file is licensed GPL and X11, but
a .dtsi it includes is licensed under the GPL, then the resulting
binary is definitely GPL-only - no questions asked.

If all the .dts and .dtsi files which are used to generate the .dtb
become licensed under the GPL and X11 licenses, then the resulting
.dtb itself becomes dual licensed.

If a .dtsi file is licensed under GPL and X11, but the .dts file is
only under the GPL, the result is GPL-only.

So, it's like a bitwise AND, with each license type being an
individual bit.

The first half is a more risky claim to make though - is the .dts file
itself something that could have been developed without the .dtsi?
Given that most .dts files reference things in the .dtsi files, I
believe the answer to that is no - which makes the .dts file a
derivative of the .dtsi.

What that would seem to imply is that the .dts files can't be dual
licensed until the .dtsi files it uses are dual licensed.

So, the "safe" approach here is to get the .dtsi files dual-licensed
first. :)
