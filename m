I asked because I really want to move towards btuart.c and integrate the vendor specific pieces there nicely. So what I did was that I posted a v2 that has the vendor abstraction build in and it would be super simple to add qca support to it. However I have no vendor specific handling from within the probe callback. If that is not needed and we can do all the clk and GPIO setup in the vendor open callback, then it should be fairly simple to do (I am ignoring IBS support for now, but I realize it is there).
I did test that and doing clk and gpio setups in qca_open seems ok.

afaiu these stubs are used to control host UART clock. The susclk 
concerns the bt chip itself.
