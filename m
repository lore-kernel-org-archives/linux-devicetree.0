I chose VOICECOMMAND as I thought this kind of feature might offer the same kind
of use as the physical button, but if this only for Google headset use then fair
enough.

Yes, this is far more simplistic, and any voice processing or capture is not
handled by the codec. It just an indication of above threshold noise level at
the mic. For the implementations you know of, how are those events indicated to
user-space?

Are you happy for me to leave the actual controls for this feature in, without
the user-space reporting side? Otherwise it's a pain to strip that out, and then
re-instate later. The event can be masked off until the user-space reporting
is added in a subsequent patch.
