Why not?

Kernel infrastructure backward compatibility means that you need to keep 
struct machine_desc instances around.  Granted, for the DT case, many of 
the members could be NULL or initialized with dummy stubs.  But that is 
very cheap to keep around, and that allows the same kernel binary to be 
able to use both the DT boot and the legacy boot.

In 10 years we might realize that non DT setups are no longer relevant 
and then all we'll have to do is rip out struct machine_desc and ignore 
the r1 value from the bootloader.  Ignoring that now means a flag day. 
And nobody wants a flag day forced upon them.
