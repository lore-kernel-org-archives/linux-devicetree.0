Ok. I went for almost everything we had in the downstream kernel so we
can work through the binding. I'll split off all these custom properties
into a different patch.

Ok.

This is about configuring the regulator to switch mode between HPM and
LPM automatically based on current. You're right that it's not about
pulse skipping, but it isn't about letting other processors control
things either. I think you're thinking about pin control?

The register field is called AUTO_MODE, so I'm finding it hard to come
up with a better name. Perhaps qcom,auto-efficient-mode-enable?
qcom,auto-current-mode-enable?

Given that regulator_allow_bypass() is a consumer facing API should I
just change this to regulator-allow-bypass and then add a set_bypass() op?

In qcom_rpm-regulator.c I think this is called bias-pull-down.

So for these sorts of generic properties how do I get them all the way
into the driver? Are you suggesting adding new ops for setting pull-down
and soft-start-enable and then parsing DT properties, setting those in
the regulation_constraints structure, and then calling the ops when we
apply constraints in set_machine_constraints()?

Yes it's generic. This property only applies to boost regulators on this
PMIC whereas OCP is only used for voltage switch type regulators. I
wonder if this should be done via regulator-min-microamp and
regulator-max-microamp being set to the same value and then implementing
a .set_current_limit() function?

These regulators have two registers. The first register says what range
(or row in the *_ranges arrays) we should use. The second register is a
selector that's used in the linear range calculation min_uV + sel *
step. The complication is here because we want to try and keep using the
same range register value for a new voltage. If we have to change the
range register to achieve a new voltage, then we want to keep the new
voltage within the set_point min/max values.

Let's take pldo_ranges for example:

static struct spmi_voltage_range pldo_ranges[] = {
        VOLTAGE_RANGE(2,  750000,  750000, 1537500, 1537500, 12500),
        VOLTAGE_RANGE(3, 1500000, 1550000, 3075000, 3075000, 25000),
        VOLTAGE_RANGE(4, 1750000, 3100000, 4900000, 4900000, 50000),
};

If the range register is programmed with '2' then the min_uV is 750000
and the step is 12500. We allow the full usage of this range up to
1537500. If the range register is programmed with '3', then the min_uV
is 1500000 and the step is 25000. This overlaps with range '2' between
1500000 and 1537500, so we force the minimum "selector" for range '3' to
be '2'. If we happen to be using range '3' and then a consumer requests
a voltage of 1500000 we'll stay in the same range register and program
the selector register to 0. If we had been on range '2' then we would
switch to range '3' and program 2 into the selector register to use 1550000.
