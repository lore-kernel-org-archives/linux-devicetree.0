The "full_name" is indeed stable for a device_node, so that isn't
actually the problem, but the full_name is the entire path from the
root of the tree to the device.  The problem is that it is far too
long for to be used as (struct device*)->kobj.name, and it has '/'
characters in it which aren't particularly friendly.  The short node
name is unique among its siblings, but not globally.

Currently the kernel constructs a 'short' name when creating a device
with a heuristic that tries to use the physical address of the device
and the node name.  If that isn't available (ie. non-memory mapped
devices), then it uses a globally incremented integer to assign each
device a unique name so that sysfs doesn't freak out.

See of_device_make_bus_id() in drivers/of/platform.c

The /real/ problem is that I don't much like the heuristic; but I
haven't been able to think of anything better.  There is enough
uncertainty (very tiny, but uncertainty never the less) on device
names, and the fact that I'm hoping to improve the method of creating
device names, that I don't want to rely on them for matching up
resources.

Instead, the dev_resdata array that is passed into
of_platform_populate() has a field to override the heuristic generated
name which neatly solves the problem entirely without tracking down
all the references that need to be added, and has the added
advantage of DT and non-DT platforms using the same names.

The clk_get() changes in this patch are absolutely the wrong solution.

Correct, I will nack/reject any patches messing about with clock
attachment or similar changes.  I was distracted by the other issues,
so I didn't comment on it in this patch.
