In the Qualcomm platform we have a single register that exposes 32
doorbells, wired to interrupts on the various processors/co-processors
in the SoC.

There is a handful of different clients each using these doorbells to
inform the other side that something has happened (often that some
piece of shared memory has been filled with data). Over the years
(platforms) this register has moved around as such multiple
implementations exists.

You can see an example of this in
drivers/mailbox/qcom-apcs-ipc-mailbox.c and e.g.
drivers/rpmsg/qcom_glink_native.c (qcom_glink_rpm.c prior to v4.14).



I'm struggling to figure out exactly how your case looks like, but if
your doorbell exists in only one instance and there is only one client
then I would suggest that it's overkill to create another driver for
it.
