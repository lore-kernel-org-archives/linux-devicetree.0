So, I think we shouldn't change the DT binding at all now. The original
driver is now merged for 3.10, and I think it's far too late to take
code that implements new features for 3.10. This means that we couldn't
merge this patch until 3.11. However, by then, we shouldn't be changing
the DT binding in incompatible ways. Olof has already published some
U-Boot binaries that use the current binding, and on IRC indicated he'd
prefer not to change the binding because of that.

As such, we should either:

a) Just add new entries into the format array that already exists in the
driver. Given David's response, this might be simplest.

b) Extend the DT binding in a 100% backwards-compatible way, which would
mean defaulting the bit-order to match the existing 1 format, and adding
a new Boolean property to indicate that the format string is specified
in the other order.
