That is what we are doing here, the reason for the custom mixer control
is that the controlled bits span two registers in a odd way that is not
supported by the standard handlers.

This was done so this table exactly matches the existing table. If you
would like me to change this then I can, and can do it for the other
table as well, up to you.
