Ideally, dtb files are shipped with firmware separately from the OS.
You should be able to run multiple OS's with that dtb. There is often
desire or "requirements" to not have GPL code in firmware.

It would be a lot of work to sort out. If people need non-GPL dts/dtb
files then it is really their problem to sort out and audit their dts
files. I mainly tell people to dual license so they (and their
company) think about the issue.
