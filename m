Hi Shawn,

Thanks for feedback.

Hmm.. Yes, can be done.

AFAIK, there is no voltage scaling.

@Shiraz/Deepak: Can you confirm?

There are few more patches we have for this driver, which are depending
on some mach stuff to be pushed first. We need to program system controller
too for make cpu clock transitions more stable. They should come after some
