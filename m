Do you have predictions for what those areas would be? Chances are
that at least the initial ones can be handled with the methods we
already have today such as quirks and the like.

Once we've seen enough of them, we'll have more knowledge of what a
new solution really needs to cover. Speculating prematurely will
likely give us the wrong abstractions (and/or at too high a level,
causing extra work and churn for everybody). I think we agree that
holding off is the right answer, just maybe not (yet) what the actual
solution might be when we start to need it. :)

Well, you menion DT-in-ACPI above. If they're really exploring that
path then a lot will sort itself out from there. Making a decision to
hold off with ACPI for ARM will help get everybody on the same page if
they're already considering a solution along those lines.

Yep, and together for review is a critical part. I'm not saying that
the ideal solution is a flashed DTB, but it's better than ACPI. A
flashed DTB that's _easy to update_ as part of an OS install would
probably be one of the best solutions we could ask for though.

+1. Especially if their initial focus is just on linux and not on
enabling RT on the same set of machines (with the same firmware).

Given that we have a documented boot protocol today, it shouldn't
matter much if someone ports over some MIPS firmware (we did add OF
client interface to CFE at PA Semi, and that worked well for us :-).
Most of the others listed above can hopefully be avoided by us having
appropriate solutions in-kernel today that they can reuse. I.e. FEX
happened because DT didn't exist at the time.

ACPI is a big problem here in that sense: Vendors have been told to
use it, but there's no infrastructure, and even if it would be there
it would be immature and we don't really know what we want from it.

Board files and hardcoded devices are things we've dealt with already
and know what to do with, so I'm less worried about that. And finally,
custom firmware interfaces should hopefully be rare given the
reference PSCI implementation from ARM, but we can deal with it if we
have to.

Yes, we're likely to see some false starts, or even successful starts
done wrong. Hopefully we can catch them early and get them onto a
better track quickly. Especially once they realize they really do
want/need upstream support for their platforms.

I do hope we'll start to see more from the vendors that are working on
silicon soon, or things run the risk of getting really messy. :(
