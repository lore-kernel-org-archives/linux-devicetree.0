I am also interested to look at such a framework in order to have a
clean implementation of the ETM, PMI/CMI (HW tracing IP on OMAP4+).
I am currently busy on a driver for PMI/CMI which requires some
configuration of the Coresight, ETM, ETB, ATB etc. IP blocks.

Could you send your patches to linux-arm and linux-omap mailing lists?
I will be pleased to review them.

Jean
