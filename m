Each half-bridge output OUT_{A,B,C,D} has its own dedicated
PVDD_{A,B,C,D} supply on 5711:

I don't understand the statement: "those are three separate supplies
that are typically tied together."  AVDD/DVDD are 3.3v fixed but PVDD
is 8V minimum (5711) or 4.5V minimum (5717/5719).  So AVDD/DVDD can
never be driven by the same regulator output as PVDD.  Perhaps you
were thinking of HPVDD/AVDD/DVDD on 5717/5719?

The simplified application diagram on page 2 does show that AVDD/DVDD
are typically tied together, and that PVDD_* are also typically tied
together.  But as you pointed out, there may be situations where that
isn't the case, so that leaves us with up to 6 separate supplies on
5711, or 5 on 5717/5719.  The typical case is probably closer to 2 or
3, though.

So, request one regulator per VDD pin?  Or group all of PVDD_* into a
single regulator?
