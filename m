Hi Hans,

Apologies for the delay in replying to this.

I'd like to be clear that I do understand that there is a problem that
needs to be addressed here. However, I do not believe that the *current*
in-kernel approach is correct. More on that below.

To some extent, Rob and I may have differing views here; I'm not
entirely sure what Rob's view is, and I cannot talk on his behalf. I
certainly must apologise for having not commented on said RFC, however.

As I mentioned at ELCE, one major concern I have with this approach is
this probing, which in part relies on a collection of heuristics.

I'm worried that this is very fragile, and sets us up for having to
maintain a much larger collection of heuristics and/or a database of
particular boards in future. This is fragile, defeats much of the gain
from DT.

Worse, this could be completely incompatible with some arbitrary board
that comes by in future, because the kernel assumed something that was
not true, which it would not have done if things were explicitly
described to the kernel.

As I mentioned at ELCE, I'm not opposed to the concept of the kernel
applying overlays or fixups based on a well-defined set of criteria;
having some of that embedded in the DT itself would be remarkably
helpful. However, I am very much not keen on loosely defined criteria as
with here, as it couples the DT and kernel, and creates problems longer
term, as described above.

I have to ask, why is it more dangerous?

Perhaps more difficult, but that can be solved, if the manual
corrections are simply a set of options to be passed to the kernel, I
don't see why the bootloader cannot pick this up.

Given that DTBs are supposed to remain supported, users should find
themselves with a system that continues to work, but may not have all
the bells and whistles it could, much like elsewhere.

While it's true that we have issues in this area, I don't think that's
an argument for putting things into the kernel for this specific set of
boards.

At least on the DT front, a lot of work has gone into improving the
infrastructure, e.g. the work that Free Electrons have done [1]. I
appreciate that the infrastructure for things like poking SPI may not be
as advanced.

Which bits of infrastructure do you find lacking today?

I think this conflates a number of details. Yes, we'd like firmware and
bootloaders to be small, and yes, their infrastructure and feature
support will be smaller than a general purpose OS.

That doesn't imply that they cannot have features necessary to boostrap
an OS.

It's also not strictly necessary that the firmware or bootloader have
the capability to do all this probing, as that could be contained in
another part (e.g. a U-Boot application which is run once to detect the
board details, logging this into a file).

It's also possible to ship an intermediary stage (e.g. like the
impedance matcher) which can be upgradeable independently of the kernel.

Sorry, but I must disagree. This code:

(a) identifies a set of boards based on a top-level compatible string.
    i.e. it's sole purpose is to handle those boards.

(b) assumes non-general properties of those boards (e.g. that poking
    certain SPI endpoints is safe).

(c) applies arbitrary properties to the DT, applying in-built knowledge
    of those boards (in addition to deep structural knowledge of the
    DTB in question).

To me, given the implicit knowledge, that qualifies as a "board file".

As I mentioned at ELCE, if this had no knowledge of the boards in
question, I would be less concerned. e.g. if there was a well-defined
identification mechanism, describe in the DT, with fixups also defined
in the DT.

Your talk convinced me that we're both going to see more variation
within this family of boards, and that we'll see more families of boards
following a similar patter. Given that, I think that we need a more
general solution, as I commented on the RFC.

That doesn't necessarily mean that this can't happen in the kernel, but
it certainly needs to be more strictly defined, e.g. with match criteria
and fixups explicit in the DTB.

Thanks,
Mark.
