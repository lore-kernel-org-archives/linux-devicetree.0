 I wish to have seen this serie before as it have some inconsistencies.

 In patch 2 you renamed allwinner,sun50i-a64-sram-controller to
allwinner,sun50i-a64-system-control but the former was never used in
the DTS, the compatible used was allwinner,sun50i-a64-system-controller.
 You also say that you've never seen use of it. How can you make that
claim ? There is a lot of downstream users of DTS now (FreeBSD, NetBSD,
OpenBSD and even RiscOS and Haiku iirc), it's not just Linux.
 Also this compatible is currently the one used in the u-boot dts,
which mean that users of the embedded DTB use or can use it (which is
the default for EFI users of U-Boot).

 Cheers,
