There are several points which I think you failed to understand:

1. DRM vs device tree is an incompatibility.
2. Trying to bend DRM to DT with independent driver solutions such as
   the abomination that is imx-drm creates its own set of problems.

If a subsystem doesn't work well with DT, then the choices are either:

(a) don't use DT with the subsystem
(b) fix the subsystem

The choices do not include:

(c) creating an abomination that is fragile, and is trivially easy to
oops the kernel.

This comes back to the root problem I'm trying to highlight: we are not
trying to strive for DT forsaking everything else.  If moving to DT
means we give up with proper code design, then we've quite literally
lost the plot.

Honestly, I don't see imx-drm ever moving out of drivers/staging except
by deletion or being rewritten.
