On a lot of chips, there is actually one device that holds the soc
identification registers, and that can easily be used for this purpose.

Originally, the soc_device was meant to be the parent device for all
other on-chip devices and be bound to the DT node that holds that
bus (unlike things like external clocks that are not part of the SoC).

However, that model has never really caught on, and we have stopped
doing this for new chips. Instead, the soc_device now somewhat
stands for itself.

We have had several drivers in the past that needed to figure out
whether they were running on a particular version of a SoC, and that
could not get this information from the DT. My suggested solution
for this is to provide an API from soc_bus that compares a
glob string to the available soc_device instance(s) in order to
figure out whether we are running on a particular kind of system.
