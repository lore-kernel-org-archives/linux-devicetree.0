iiuc, overlays were intended for daughterboard (capes, etc) specific
info.  It may be useful here, but I'd like to hear from the DT
maintainers how they want it used.  eg: most popular first, like you
have it, or oldest first

dove-cubox-es.dts
+--> dove-cubox.dts

There's also what to do with the older files using #include...

In short, I'd prefer to stick to the old method until we have a good
reason to move to overlays and a recommended way to execute that.*

thx,

Jason.

* There's also the distinct possibility this was decided/announced and I
  missed it...
