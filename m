Jean-Francois,

be careful with building a DT binding from a Linux driver. Although
we constantly struggle to define a binding independent of Linux, it
should not reflect what Linux is capable of but describe the HW in
general.

There is a "DT is ABI" policy and although there is no mainline Linux
user of current compatible, the correct way would be to deprecate
"nxp,tda998x" and introduce new compatibles.

Also, as long as we don't know about any major differences between
9989, 1998[89] it is fine to just have one of them defined. As soon
as we discover any difference that cannot be solved in another way,
we can add a new compatible.

What we _know_ is that 998[134] are different from 9989,1998[89]
with respect to additional CEC feature. But we also _know_ that the
exact version/revision of 9989,1998[89] can be probed from i2c
registers.

DT maintainers will know better, but as long as we have no prove that
998[134] can also be properly distinguished by i2c registers, just add
"nxp,tda9989" (which was probably the first revision released) and
assume 1998[89] are "compatible enough". Or add all three and make
"nxp,tda9989" the mandatory compatible.

You can leave out 998[134] for now.

The line above and below reg property look like there is a tab. If
so, can you please get rid of the blank line above and fix the line
below?

Depending on above decision this becomes either

compatible = "nxp,tda9989";

or

compatible = "nxp,tda19988", "nxp,tda9989";

Independent of the decision above, just "nxp,tda9989" is
sufficient.
