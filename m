Yeah, I missed that question. I started answering that yesterday, but then
I realized that it would be better if I would make a helper function for
v4l2-dv-timings. The rules are complex so coding that in a single place
that everyone can use is the smart thing to do.

I hope to finish it tomorrow (too many interruptions today).
