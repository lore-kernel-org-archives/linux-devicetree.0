Alright. I am not sure if "reclaim" is the right term for this, but it
doesn't matter ;) I understand the intent now.

I see now.

I think I was thrown off by looking at the fact that mcasp0_pins in
da850-evm.dts muxes UART2_RTS as AMUTE. But, its the mcasp0_pins that
needs fixing. AMUTE is not used by audio on the board. As is AFSR. Plus,
that pinmux entry goes and writes to PINMIX0[31:28] the value of 0x1
which is reserved. Sigh.

I will review your original e-mail and reply back.

Thanks,
Sekhar
