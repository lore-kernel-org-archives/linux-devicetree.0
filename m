Thanks for pointing at these examples! According to linux-sunxi.org wiki this
wireless chip might be related to ST cw1200 (drivers/net/wireless/st/cw1200).
I will check if it has any bindings as well.

I have no idea. I haven't yet had a chance to hack around this driver:
only basic testing
and brief comparison with cw1200 driver.
