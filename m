Fair enough - I didn't look too closely at your new changes, especially
why it apparently worked before.
But as your list shows, we would only need one compatible string per
line - in the driver - to cover all SoCs (and possibly future SoCs!),
and do the rest via the properties.
We can't use the existing h3 compatible string or touch the already
existing SoCs and compatible strings, of course, but I guess
the A64, R40 and future SoCs could make use of a new (generic?) string.

The latter is usually frowned upon, using separate compatible strings
for each group of SoCs is the way to go here.

So looking more closely at the manual and the code my understanding is
that nr_max_requests is more or less some rough molly guard to prevent
wrong settings? Derived from the DRQ table in the manual?
So that trying to program port 28 on an H3 would fail?
But source port 25 or dest port 26 wouldn't be caught by this check,
though they would still be "illegal" according to the manual. (Which we
are not sure of, I guess, it may just not be documented)
So I wonder if this nr_max_requests is useful at all, and we should just
check that it fits into 5 bits and assume that the DT has superior
knowledge of what's allowed and what not.
Now I see what you mean with the bitmask (to cover those gaps), but I am
bit sceptical if that is actually useful. After all the DRQ number would
be coming from the DT, which we can surely trust.

And nr_max_vchans seems to describe the sum of documented DRQs, to just
limit the memory allocation? So this could become just 64 to cover all
possible cases without SoC specific configuration at all?

Sure, actually looking at Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
I think we can even use the generic "dma-channels" property described
there. And possibly the same with "dma-requests", should we keep this.

So summarizing this:
- We create a new compatible string, which drives an H3 compatible DMA
(clock autogating at 0x28, 64-bit data width capable). This name could
either be generic, or actually "allwinner,sun50i-a64-dma".
- This one sets nr_max_requests to 31 and nr_max_vchans to 64.
- Alternatively we expose those values in the DT as properties.
- We take the number of DMA channels from the (now required)
"dma-channels" property.
- We let the A64 (and R40?) use this new binding.
- Any future SoC which is close enough can then just piggy-back on this.
- Any future *changes* in the Allwinner DMA device which require driver
changes create a new compatible string, but still keep the above
semantics. Chances are that there are more than one SoC using this kind
of new DMA device, so they would work out of the box.

Does that make sense?
I am happy to provide the code for that, based on your H3 rework.

Cheers,
Andre.
