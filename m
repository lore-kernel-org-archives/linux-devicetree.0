This is the rough idea, yes. In the moment the clock code sits in the
ARM Trusted Firmware part, but in fact this is an implementation detail.
Theoretically we could also move that clock code to U-Boot on 32-bit
SoCs to sit next to the PSCI implementation, which uses the same smc
call mechanism as I do in this first implementation.
But unfortunately we cannot remove the existing code from the kernel,
since that would break all existing users (unless they upgrade their
firmware). So I am not sure if supporting older SoCs with this mechanism
is worthwhile.

But: yes, I want to avoid adding tedious clock descriptions for each and
every new SoC to the kernel. What really worries me is that sunxi-ng
makes this situation probably worse, as we now have to add SoC specific
"code" (in fact: clock descriptions) for every SoC, even if that chip
doesn't introduce any new clock type.

We could do. But SCPI does not have an explicit enable/disable
interface, it only describes that setting the frequency to 0 disables
the clock. For enabling it one would have to set some frequency (!= 0),
which the firmware could then translate into a "set that bit in the gate
register" for any gate-only clock, which sounds rather hackish to me.
Also it would require to alter the SCPI clock driver to implement the
enable/disable ops, since I think we never call set_rate for those clocks.

So having the quite straight forward "simple-gates" driver around seems
more sane. In the end this driver just translates "clock number x" into
"bit number x" in that register, which is very generic. That's why I
urged to introduce a fallback compatible name to express this very feature.

Cheers,
Andre.
