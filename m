I'm aware there is some ugliness there, and still open to someone having
a better idea that we have not yet considered.

But yes, the desired functionality over rides the ugliness.  Forcing the
overhead for all users of the board, even those who will never use an
overlay is not a good choice.  The ability to opt out is important.
