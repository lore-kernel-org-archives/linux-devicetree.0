Thanks for the links, if people are determined this is the way
to go I can live with it. I guess my primary objection is the
fact my parts are going to have different compatibles depending
on if they are on I2C/SPI or on SLIMBus (we have many parts that
support all three on the same chip) which feels like it violates
the principle of least surprise. Will wait to see if Arnd or Rob
have anymore thoughts to offer.

I am pretty sure kstrtoul is happy without the 0x as long as you
specify the base as 16 which I guess you should be doing here.

Thanks,
