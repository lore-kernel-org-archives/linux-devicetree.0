Ok.

Yes, you can only use it from drivers in drivers/irqchip/.

The device tree is populated in unflatten_device_tree(), which gets
called before init_early.

I generally dislike adding any platform specific hooks to "early"
functions, i.e. stuff that runs before init_machine, and I'm pretty
sure it's not necessary here.

Ok.
