This is a manual cherry pick of a commit currently queued up for merging
into 4.2, titled:
"ARM: dts: sunxi Adjust touchscreen compatible for sun5i and later"

For the 4.1 stable series, fixing a regression in 4.1 where we are now
reporting the wrong SoC temperature for sun5i and sun7i SoCs.

Conflicts:
	arch/arm/boot/dts/sun5i.dtsi

Original commit message:

The touchscreen controller in the A13 and later has a different temperature
curve than the one in the original A10, change the compatible for the A13 and
later so that the kernel will use the correct curve.
