Furthermore CDF was an RFC, a proof of concept implementation of the various 
components involved to solve the problems at hand. It was in no way meant to 
be merged as-is, and I would certainly have made the asynchronous registration 
code generic had I been requested to do so specifically. Unfortunately and 
sadly miscommunication lead to CDF being rejected in one block with a fuzzy 
message on how to proceed. We won't rewrite the past, but let's move forward 
in the right direction.

That's correct. The CDF composite device model was based on the V4L2 composite 
device model, implemented in drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-async.c. Both are 
very similar in purpose to the component framework. The reason why it wasn't 
generic in the first place was that I wanted to implement a full solution as a 
proof of concept first between polishing each part independently. That turned 
out not to be the best decision ever.

As mentioned in my reply to Russell's component framework patch, I would like 
to base v4l2-async on top of the component framework. For this to be possible 
we need support for partial bind in the component framework, which would make 
it possible to support your use cases. Let's discuss how to achieve that in 
the other mail thread.
