No, we should be able to fix it. It's just some weird configuration
that has triggered this. Generally people just replace entire tarball
into uSD and hence it is not tested very well for such cases.

No, we have seen issues in past especially UEFI.

Ah that's good, some progress.

I will focus on this and see what's happening. I have issue with network
on my setup with debug build and Linaro guys are not seeing it. I revert
to release build of UEFI for that. Anyways one suggestion I have right
now is to erase the second partition of NOR flash where the old UEFI
config is placed and it could be conflicting with the new UEFI image.

Cmd> flash
 

Switching on main power...
PMIC RAM configuration (pms_v105.bin)...
IOFPGA config: PASSED
Enabling usb remote...
 

Flash> ERASERANGE 0x0BFC0000 0x0BFF0000

I will looking into that further.
