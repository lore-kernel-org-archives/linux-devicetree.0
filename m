Any IDs specified here would only apply to DMA by the "platform device" 
side of the host controller itself (as would an equivalent "iommus" 
property on pcie0 once I finish the SMMUv2 generic binding support I'm 
working on). In terms of PCI devices, the "mmu-masters" property is 
overloaded such that only its existence matters, to identify that there 
_is_ a relationship between the SMMU and the PCI bus(es) behind that 
host controller.

Really, the only binding that's going to make sense for that context is 
"iommu-map". I think that should be pretty straightforward to implement 
entirely in core OF/IOMMU code - we can already figure out a device's 
DMA alias as the host controller sees it, we just need the IOMMU drivers 
to be able to then run that through an additional downstream translation 
(which would be identity-mapped by default).
