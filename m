As far as I can tell, patch 3/6 doesn't require these to be in any
order, as it uses 'reg-names' to fetch the values. Perhaps the
following:

reg-names : must contain:
	"core" - core registers
	"intr" - interrupt controller registers
	"cnfg" - configuration registers
reg : A list of address + size pairs for the regs listed in reg-names

These two are new.... Is it expected that they should be required?

Although it's probably fairly understood that this is a boolean, it
wouldn't hurt to mention that here.  It might also be worth referencing
devicetree/binding/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt in your opening
blurb.

Nitpick: This '= <X>' differs from the above 'must be set to X' format.
