This binding is likely going to cover most of existing sound system
configuration, at least it looks as it has a potential to be scalable
enough.  So perhaps we could treat is as a more generic binding and
could drop the "Simple" word now?  I'm not 100% sure it's a good idea,
but maybe we could make it "Generic Sound Card DT Binding"?

The DT bindings should be OS agnostic, I think we should drop the 
"${LINUX}/" part here and elsewhere in this documentation.

"asoc" is Linux related, we shouldn't be putting this in the compatible string.
Perhaps "generic-sound-card" ? Again, I'm sure if it is expected to have such
a generic kind of DT binding.

I wouldn't be making a separate case for single DAI. The 'ports' node can 
be omitted, port@0, port@1 nodes could be put under respective device nodes 
and in the 'sound' node we would have 'dais' property pointing to the CPU 
DAI port,  not the endpoint.  The endpoint is supposed to describe one of 
possible configurations of the port.  I think we want phandles to the 'port' 
nodes, not phandles to the 'endpoint' nodes in the 'sound' node.
