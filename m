That's a good question and sides with Arnd's suggestion to try to manda=
te the presence of the PCI
domain in the DTS. However, by grepping through the source code, it loo=
ks like the architectures
that use the domain number for reading config registers (x86-based) are=
 non-DT architectures,
while DT-aware arches seem to ignore the domain number except when prin=
ting out messages. Is that
another confirmation that most DT-aware architectures have only run wit=
h domain_nr =3D 0?

Not as such if you look with x86 glasses. With the exception of powerpc=
 all other architecures
seem to happily assume domain_nr =3D 0 and ignore it in the computation=
 of configuration registers
offsets.
