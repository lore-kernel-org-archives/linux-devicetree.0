FYI, I'm working on a patch to the kernel to bring in the latest dtc.

I've run a regression test vs. the old dtc in the kernel and found that
some of the PowerPC .dts files don't compile with the new dtc (but did
with the old), all due to non-existent labels/paths being referenced.
I'll try and track down whether this is a regression in dtc, or simply
buggy .dts files that weren't noticed before.

Everything non-PowerPC works fine, and most PowerPC files work fine.
Where compilation succeeds, the md5sum of the .dtb is identical in every
case.
