This patch would break the current syntax without introducing any
improvements over it (actually the opposite, see bellow). So in its
current form I don't like this patch at all.

But there is no such problem with the current code any more. The new
preferred way is to indicate bitclock and frame master with phandles
that refer to the master DAI on the link (see the examples bellow).

I do not object in getting rid of this simplified description for a
single dailink card:

(example 1)
sound {
	compatible = "simple-audio-card";
...
	simple-audio-card,format = "left_j";
	simple-audio-card,bitclock-master = <&dailink0_master>;
	simple-audio-card,frame-master = <&dailink0_master>;
	simple-audio-card,cpu {
		sound-dai = <&sh_fsi2 0>;
	};

	dailink0_master: simple-audio-card,codec {
		sound-dai = <&ak4648>;
		clocks = <&osc>;
	};
};

and describing the DAI-links always like this:

(example 2)
sound {
	compatible = "simple-audio-card";
...
	simple-audio-card,dai-link@0 {
		format = "i2s";
		bitclock-master = <&dailink0_master>;
		frame-master = <&dailink0_master>;
		dailink0_master: cpu {
			sound-dai = <&audio1 0>;
		};
		codec {
			sound-dai = <&tda998x 0>;
		};
	};
};

But I do object going back to the old syntax exclusively and
describing the bitclock and frame master always with simple boolean
properties, like this:

(example 3)
sound {
	compatible = "simple-audio-card";
...
	simple-audio-card,dai-link@0 {
		format = "i2s";
		dailink0_master: cpu {
			sound-dai = <&audio1 0>;
		};
		codec {
			sound-dai = <&tda998x 0>;
			bitclock-master;
			frame-master;
		};
	};
};

In my opinion we should rather get rid of this syntax than move
exclusively to it.

The syntax of example 2 is simply superior to the syntax of example
3. With the syntax on example 2 it is possible to describe TDM setups
where there is multiple codecs on a single i2s bus. The syntax of
example 3 simply can not describe that kind of setup.

If you need to have the backwards compatibility syntax describing the
clock masters to work also in the multilink mode (example 3), then do
just that (it is simple enough [1]). But please do not break the new
phandle based syntax!!!

Best regards,
Jyri
