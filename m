The DSM is kind of running logic instead of configuration which is provided by 
system firmware. It's defined in the UEFI spec and supported by Linux. In the
NVDIMM case here, it's used to do Address Range Scrub (ARS), I2C access (such as
reading the DIMM SPD information), runtime health check, etc. 

DSM is kind of requirement by NVDIMM, such as
https://pmem.io/documents/NVDIMM_DSM_Interface_Example.pdf
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/-dsm-interface-for-byte-addressable-energy-backed-function-class--function-interface-1-

By following the ACPI DSM definitions, there is no extra drivers needed in 
Linux due to the existing ACPI framework.  Since it's 'standard' APIs in UEFI, 
it has potential to support other OS other than Linux.

Hardware specific driver might be able to do some of the functionality, or
even 'simulate' some of the ACPI implementation or APIs. I guess it might need 
a framework for it which I haven't thought a lot of details yet :)
