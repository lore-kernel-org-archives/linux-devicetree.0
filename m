Hi Michal,

I have a few minor comments below, but generally this is looking like
one of the best dts submissions I've seen!

Thanks for using stdout-path with the full parameters.

Does your UART have earlycon support?

I guess this is fine, though to me it feels more natural to use
#size-cells = <2> in case we need to describe larger ranges for some bus
later.

These look fine.

Neat!

What are you using as your implementation? Are all the mandatory
PSCIv0.2 features implemented (e.g. MIGRATE_INFO_TYPE)?

I take it this boots at EL2 on all CPUs?

Does CPU0 hotplug work?

Do you need to keep a CPU online or do you require MIGRATE? e.g. does
MIGRATE_INFO_TYPE return something other than 2 ("MP or not present")?

The architected timer should just be under the root node, given it's a
component of the CPU -- it doesn't live on any bus.

I take it CNTFRQ is configured appropriately on all CPUs?

That clock-frequency looks a little odd. Is that right?

I haven't taken an in-depth look at the other nodes. They look sane at a
high-level, and assuming they are all already documented and supported
they look fine to me.

Thanks,
Mark.
