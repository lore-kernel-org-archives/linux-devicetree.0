Read the clock binding doc. Names are optional and the 2 names are not
the same. One is the name of the output on the CCM and one is the name
on input to the module.

While generally optional, Shawn has chosen to require at least the
output names. In the case of defining a signal clock controller node
with lots of outputs, that is the right choice.
