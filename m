But the main problem is that there is no way to detect the current mode (i.e.
secure or non-secure). So it won't be of any help even if we can get these
information from DT. It's better to assume Linux runs in non-secure mode and
avoid using any registers with secure only access. Any attempt to such
restricted access in non-secure mode results in error.

Yes I understand, but for above mentioned reason it's difficult.
