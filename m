I'm not looking to discourage individuals trying to get upstream support
for older boards. Should the need arise, we'll look at options which may
or may not include kernel changes (e.g. wrap the kernel in a shim).

But I'm definitely going to discourage companies like Qualcomm
deliberately ignoring the existing booting protocols while trying to get
their code upstream. This patch series is posted by Qualcomm without
providing any technical reason on why they don't want to/couldn't use
PSCI (well, I guess there is no technical reason but they may not care
much about mainline either).
