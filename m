Ok, if it's not called no code in sound/soc/codecs/wm9713.c will be used, right
?
In that case wm9713_set_dai_clkdiv() will never be used, nor will the
wm9713_audio_map or wm9713_dapm_widgets be created, which will break all
userspace programs relying on these mixers and DAPM routes.

Or am I missing something ?

I suppose you mean sound/arm/aaci.c, which is more a platform_data like driver
(if I understood the integrator code correctly).

I suppose we can achieve comparable result with sound/arm/pxa2xx-ac97.c, but as
to know if the functionality will be comparable to sound/soc/pxa/pxa2xx-ac97.c,
it's hard to say. If I count the DMA requestors, I see 5 in the sound/soc
version, and 2 in sound/arm.

That makes me believe the sound/arm version is inferior.

Cheers.
