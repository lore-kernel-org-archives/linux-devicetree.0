I think you've convinced me that if the prerequisite is
set up at initialization time, the consumers don't need
to know about the the clock tree.

Yes, I should have looked more closely before.

Are you suggesting this prerequisite notion get elevated into the
common framework?  Or is "hw" here just representative of the
Kona-specific clock structure?

In any case, you're suggesting the prerequisite be handled in the
enable path (as opposed to the one-time initialization path),
which during the course of this discussion I've been thinking may
be the right way to do it.

Let me see if I can rework it that way and I'll let you know
what I discover as a result.  I hope to have something to
talk about later today.

Thanks a lot Mike.
