After looking at how many files we're now creating under
Documentation/devicetree/bindings, I'm starting to think we need to go
entirely the other way and put whole the whole family of an SoC into a
single binding file, particularly for the SoC integration level stuff
that isn't likely to be shared with SoCs from other vendors.

A decision on this can be deferred as we're working on schema tools.
Some of that may fall out when we figure out what the structure of the
schema files should be.

> Also, by having bindings for similar devices for different SoCs kept together it becomes easier for us to see patterns across SoCs as we might come up with a more generic binding in the future.  Far more difficult if things are SoC oriented.

The downside is bindings for a single SoC get distributed among a lot of
files which makes it more difficult to follow how the SoC is put
together and configured.
