I would much prefer that overlays get applied before the unflattened
devicetree is made available to the kernel instead of applying overlays
late in the boot (after many susbsystems and drivers are initialized)
or after boot.

If overlays are applied before the unflattened devicetree is made
available to the kernel then subsystems and drivers do not have to be
aware of the possibility of the data in the devicetree changing instead
of being invariant.  (I will call this "apply early overlays" later in
this email.)

There are use cases of overlays where the overlay is not available until
late in the boot, or after the boot completes.  I am not suggesting that
those use cases be ignored.  That is a completely different conversation.

If overlays are applied before the unflattened devicetree is made
available to the kernel, there are at least two obvious methods
(and I can think of at least one more) -- either the kernel does it
or the bootloader does it.  I do not see either of the two as being
the obvious and only correct choice.  If the kernel does it, then
there is no need for multiple bootloaders to implement the same code.
If the bootloaders do it, then there is no need for multiple kernels
(Linux, BSD, etc) to implement the same code.  I do not have a
strong opinion about whether the bootloaders or the kernels are a
better place to apply early overlays.

If you read my circular dependency sentence carefully, I said a kernel
driver is impractical for the task of getting the overlay.  So I agree.

If the kernel applies the overlay, an alternative to drivers is that the
kernel could receive the overlay(s) in a similar manner as the method it
currently receives the base devicetree.  (The overlay(s) could be
appended to the base devicetree, a wrapper could be placed around the
base devicetree and the overlay(s), or some other implementation.  There
are multiple ways to achieve the same result.)
