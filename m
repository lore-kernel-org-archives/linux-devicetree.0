Yes, it matters, but only if Qualcomm wants the SoC support in mainline=
=2E
Just because Qualcomm Inc does not want to invest in implementing a
standard firmware interface is not a good enough reason to merge the
kernel code.

What if Qualcomm decides that it doesn't like DT, nor ACPI but comes up
with yet another way to describe hardware because that's what the
firmware provides? Should the kernel community take it? You could argue
that this is a significant change but it's about the principle. And eac=
h
SoC with its own non-standard boot protocol for no good reason is
significant.

It's not Qualcomm Inc maintaining the kernel code but individuals like
you and me who may or may not be sponsored by Qualcomm. And being
sponsored by a company to do kernel maintenance work does not mean that
said company decides what gets merged (on my side, ARM Ltd management i=
s
aware of this, though it's not always easy for the parties involved).

We haven't really asked for anything difficult like hardware changes,
such decisions are left with Qualcomm. We asked for a standard secure
firmware interface, either an existing one or, if not suitable (with
good arguments), to come up with a proposal for an alternative
_standard_ interface. I don't even have the certitude that the firmware
interface used in these patches would be consistent across Qualcomm
SoCs, let alone being properly documented.

So please come up with proper technical arguments rather than the kerne=
l
should take whatever SoC vendors dreamt of.
