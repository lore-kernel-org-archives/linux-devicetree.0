It's been a known limitation for a long time. However, in practice it
doesn't seem to be a common problem. Perhaps folks just remove the
less specific compatible from their DT (though that's not ideal). For
most modern bindings, there's so many other resources beyond
compatible (clocks, resets, pinctrl, etc.) that there are few generic
drivers that can work.

I guess if we want to fix this, we'd need to have weighted matching in
the driver core and unbind drivers when we get a better match. Though
it could get messy if the better driver probe fails. Then we've got to
rebind to the original driver.

Do you have a specific case where you hit this?
