I'd support this, opting for a clean split.

Strictly speaking, it should be this:

AArch64-capable hardware: #address-cells = 2
non-AArch64-capable hardware: #address-cells = 1

The only time it is valid to have #address-cells = 1 on AArch64-capable
hardware is in an AArch32 virtual machine (in which case, the DT anyway
describes the VM and not the real hardware).


However, due to the awkwardness of defining precisely what "AArch64-
capable hardware" means in a world containing firmware and hypervisors,
it might be better (if slightly less correct) to go with:

v8 hardware: #address-cells must be 2
<=v7 hardware: #address-cells must be 1


If the firmware boots an AArch32 payload natively on AArch64-capable
v8 hardware, it's the firmware's job to ensure that non-addressable
CPUs are properly quiesced and shut down, otherwise the setup is
pretty broken -- DT can't solve that one, nor can Linux, so we shouldn't
try.  Linux just needs to discard the non-addressable CPUs and maybe
print out a warning.
