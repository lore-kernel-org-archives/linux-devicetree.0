Hi,

The splitting into two regions is actually optional and that should
probably be mentioned in the commit message.

Nowhere in the commit message does this say you're also adding a 2nd
block of thermal sensors.  It seems like you should say that
somewhere.

...and it should also be obvious in ${SUBJECT}.

Note that the unit address is supposed to match the first "reg"
address, so either these should be reversed or you should update your
node name.  AKA your node name should be this now:

tsens0: thermal-sensor@4a9000

As per my responses to other patches, " #qcom,sensors" is undocumented
and doesn't appear to be read by the driver.
