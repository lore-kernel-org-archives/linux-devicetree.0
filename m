I sincerely hope that dealing with ancient platform_data defconfigs is
out of the scope this patch.

Great point. We should enable MTD for sure. There is no PXA-specific MT=
D
drivers, however. That's why MTD failed the grep test.

Updated plan:
1. MACH_PXA27X_DT
2. PXA_FB and 8250_PXA to enable console
3. MMC, MMC_PXA and EXT4_FS to enable boot from MMC
3.1. MTD, MTD_CFI, MTD_PHYSMAP_OF and JFFS2_FS to enable boot from MTD
4. all optional pxa stuff as modules
5. all stuff on supported pxa boards as modules
6. supported boards should boot the kernel built with
`pxa27x-dt_defconfig` after `make olddefconfig`

It is probably a good idea to put this plan somewhere in Documentation/
and to have a comment about that in the defconfig itself.

Is the plan acceptable?
