I hope I understand your concern better this time.

You basically have to have a reference to a node until you're done
accessing it. The refcounting in the fwnode framework is based on the OF
API --- otherwise you couldn't access OF nodes using the framework. ACPI
does not have those (as you can't dynamically remove nodes). The newly
added swnode does have refcounting of individual nodes as well.

Even if a node's parent did disappear while printing an fwnode full name,
it'd mean that

1) fwnode_count_parents() returned an incorrect value (less than expected)
   or

2) some of the node names could be NULL if node references could not be
   obtained.

Both would result into garbled output in that case. I have to admit I'm not
sure if this is possible with OF.
