I've sent patches for all the remaining MODULE_LICENSE warnings earlier
this week, and we should now have patches for almost all the dtc
warnings in flight. This is what I still see on my randconfig builder
with linux-next + arm-soc/for-next + patches I sent:

     arch/arm/boot/dts/spear1310-evb.dtb: Warning (gpios_property):
Missing property '#gpio-cells' in node /interrupt-controller@ec801000
or bad phandle (referred from /ahb/apb/spi@e0100000:cs-gpios[6])
     arch/arm/boot/dts/spear1310-evb.dtb: Warning (gpios_property):

Not sure why the spear warnings are still there, maybe Viresh missed those
or you missed one of his patches?

I hope Linus Walleij can find out what the right interrupt-parent
should be on the
nomadik machine, that is otherwise the last remaining warning. Apparently the
clcd driver doesn't actually need its interrupt, so we could decide to
just comment
out that line if we don't know which controller it's connected to.
