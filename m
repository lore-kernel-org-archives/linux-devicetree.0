I agree. And we may apply it only to i.MX platforms with DMA if
other platform owners feel comfortable with the previous settings.

The watermark is merely a threshold to trigger a DMA request. The
only relationship with the burst size is that each burst transfer
should not carry more data than the number of empty slots; FIFO
under/overflow occurs otherwise. So it's just more efficient and
safer to set an identical value to both of them. I don't think
it will cause functional problems to set TFWM to 4 and burst size
to 1 -- It just lets DMA operate in a single data transfer mode.
