No, I am not. Please do not presume to put words in my mouth.

I explicitly described a case where binding review took effort, and the
presence or absence of drivers was irrelevant. We later had drivers,
yes, but we had to understand the hardware to get the binding right
first.

If there's data which has no consumer, it has no value being in the DT.
Placing data with no consumer in the DT comes with a number of issues,
e.g.

a) Some DTS authors will ignore it, and not place data according to it
   in DTs. Hence there's no gain in consistency.

b) Though some accident (perhaps a typo, perhaps a misunderstanding of
   the binding), a DT will come to have erroneous data, yet this will go
   unnoticed, as there is no consumer. When later a consumer appears, it
   can't trust existing DTs, and has to either ignore the binding
   entirely, or bodge around each and every broken DT.

c) When a consumer eventually appears, it turned out we didn't capture
   details of the hardware sufficiently, and the binding turns out to be
   useless. At worst, this boils down to (b), at best, we require
   additional properties. In this case absolutely nothing is gained.

In all cases, all we end up doing is enlarging DTBs, and risk causing
even more work.

If there *is* going to be a consumer, and if information regarding that
will be provided, then matters are different, and we can consider a
binding on its own merit. We need a specific example for that.

To at least the extent that if someone says they're not going to bother,
we clearly have no reason to bother supporting them.

Note that *nothing* stops you from using the DT container format for
your own purposes, in violation of every binding and rule we have.
However, for those cases we clearly won't document them as the standard
mechanism.

There are other things build atop of the DTB format, e.g. FIT, which
aren't quite devicetree in the usual sense.

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/secure.txt for the basics.

Generally, I'd expect that even if the secure OS were using DT in this
fashion, the non-secure general purpose OS would be handed a DT
containing only the non-secure world portions.

If there's no user, there's no need for the binding.

If there's some user somewhere, and that user wants the binding
rubber-stamped as an "official" binding, they need to follow the usual
rules for bindings.

If there is a user, and they don't want to follow the usual rules,
there's no point trying to get the binding rubber-stamped.

Thanks,
Mark.
