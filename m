Right, so if we add a per-regmap bool that tells us whether the device
has been reset, then in the case of "not reset" we will have to write
every regcache entry out to the device.  Even the ones that weren't
touched while in cache_only mode.  This makes the "not reset" case
much less efficient than the "reset" case.

Maybe that's good enough for most purposes.  It's no worse than what
my original patch submission did, anyway.

BTW, any preferences on naming for the bool or for the renamed
mark_dirty function?

I'm not sure I understand the question.

Thanks, that clarifies things.  I was not aware that other drivers
even had an issue with excessively large regcache rbtrees, as my
reg_defaults list is short.
