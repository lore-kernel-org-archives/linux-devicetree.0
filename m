Great:-)

I believe section 2.2.2 "Generic Names Recommendation" is the source of
the rule that nodes should be named after the type of object rather than
the identity.

"""
The name of a node should be somewhat generic, reflecting the function
of the device and not its precise programming model. If appropriate, the
name should be one of the following choices:

* atm
* cache-controller
* compact-flash
* can
* cpu
...
"""

(I note e.g. "cpu" not "cpu-1", "cpu_2", etc.)
