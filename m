Yeah, I screwed that up.  I had just applied Arnd's patch completely
to 279c5dd046, which doesn't quite make sense.

I tried again like this:

  - In "of/pci: Add pci_register_io_range() and pci_pio_to_address()",
I added the dummy pci_pio_to_address(), so there's an extern and a
definition in address.c when CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS=y, and an inline dummy
otherwise.

  - I dropped "of/pci: Define of_pci_range_to_resource() only when
CONFIG_PCI=y".

  - In "of/pci: Move of_pci_range_to_resource() to of/address.c", I
added the dummy of_pci_range_to_resource(), so there's an extern an a
definition in address.c when CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS=y and CONFIG_PCI=y, and
an inline dummy otherwise.

I'm not really set up to build test this, and my head is swimming a
bit, so I hope this is it.  I pushed the pci/host-generic branch
again, so you can look at it yourself.
