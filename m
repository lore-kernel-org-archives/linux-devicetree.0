But I think both ways would be acceptable in the end. It's not a lot
of extra code either way. In the second case, I would probably have
the legacy case as a special variant of the map_io function and have
all others be the default instead of falling back to panic though.

Agreed, I think that approach would be much worse.

Well, I think with Nico's cahnges, you /can/ actually do ioremap for
areas that have been mapped through the iotable before kmalloc is up.
IIRC, omap does this for a number of peripherals.

It's a bit of a hack, but I think it's much better than taking hardcoded
addresses.

With the combination of the points mentioned above, you should be
able to do:

- map the entire I/O area in map_io(), depending on the board
- have an __iomem pointer for the sysreg
- populate that pointer using of_iomap from the device tree address
  before you first access it.

Do you think that would work?
