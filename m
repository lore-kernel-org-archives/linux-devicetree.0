Agreed.

My gut feel is that using a filesystem and a text file is the easier way
to create the boot info.  But that also makes applying the overlay(s)
during early Linux boot (at the point of FDT unflattening) impractical
(can't access the file system without a driver, the driver depends on
the devicetree, the devicetree depends upon the overlay).
