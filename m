Limiting the scope of the product to a particular use-case (720p or
1080p video playback) will be part of firmware mostly OTP-ed in the
SoC. Firmware author could decide the amount of CMA memory needed and
put this as part of DT.
Number of CMA areas and linking them to devices could be done in DT
and allows using the same kernel for any of the combinations.
