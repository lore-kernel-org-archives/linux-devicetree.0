True enough. Didn't expect to run into this particular problem, but I guess
someone will always make hardware breaking any assumptions we make from the
software side of things.
 So I used sysfs names that would be close to what they

Fair enough as a starting point though we probably want to figure out how
to do this 'right'.   Adding an extra field to the channel descriptor will
be easy enough - it'll be event codes that are nasty to handle.

No problem with this change so please send a patch.
