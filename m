We never intentionally break things that people are using, but there are
cases where doing blind changes is the best way forward. We should
always try to find people to test patches on real hardware if possible,
which is only possible if there are people around that have the hardware
and that are going to run new kernels on them.

In case of PXA dmaengine support, I think the benefits of applying the
series far outweigh the breakage potential. A lot of the drivers are
shared with MMP, which is going to be DT-only eventually and will require
the new dmaengine code. Some PXA drivers may be shared with SA1100,
which has also converted to dmaengine although there are no plans to
ever support DT on sa1100.

We certainly need to be extra careful if we want to move things over
at once and cannot test all the drivers. I'd be happier if it could
be done gradually by having some drivers use the new interface and
other drivers use the old one, but I don't see how that can be done
here.
