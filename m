+1 for drivers/soc _and_ of_xlate for regmap instead of syscon.

driven by Mike Turquette's request to join mach-berlin clock node into a
single node, we currently use pinctrl driver (that must be somewhere in
Linus inbox) as a crutch to register a regmap for other drivers.

I also saw that Arnd requested to not chop chip registers into tiny
pieces for Linux subsystems but rather have a single DT node and make
the drivers use it.

Mike also mentioned he is fine with different subsystem drivers reusing
the same node property-wise, i.e. reset and clock in a single node.

With Berlin (and other SoCs for sure) ultimately there will be a bunch
of drivers that require the io resource and the node early and
non-early. Now, using syscon would still require dummy nodes for each
subsystem, as there will be only one driver registered to a single DT
node.

With a drivers/soc we'd have a good place for those messy, SoC-specific
registers to put a driver that hooks up to a single node and takes care
of registering e.g. pinctrl and reset the plain-old platform_device
way. It will be a little bit like arm/mach-foo before, but maybe we
have to admit that on SoCs there will always be some amount of
very specific, non-probable, non-describable registers that simply need
special treatment.
