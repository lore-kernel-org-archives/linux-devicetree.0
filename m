This sounds like it's going to break in the case where we have MFDs that
represent their functions in DT (not a pattern I'm a fan of but it's a
thing people do).  We'll walk back to the platform device for the MFD
function, try to probe it and then give up.  Perhaps that's good enough
anyway but it's not clear to me why we don't just try every parent we
find?

I'm also not a fan of the fact that the interface here is explicitly
saying that we want to probe a platform device, that's an implementation
detail that callers shouldn't need to know about.  From the point of
view of the callers what they're trying to do is kick any dependencies
into being instantiated, the fact that we currently try to accomplish it
with platform devices isn't something they care about.
