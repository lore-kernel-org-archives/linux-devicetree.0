Can you convert this to DT schema given it is a common binding.

What does the host controller look like? You need to define the node 
hierarchy. Bus controller schemas should then include the bus schema. 
See spi-controller.yaml.

This can all be a regex.

The normal way to distinguish instances is with 'reg'. So I think you 
need 'reg' with Instance ID moved there at least. Just guessing, but 
perhaps Link ID, too? And for 2 different classes of device is that 
enough?
