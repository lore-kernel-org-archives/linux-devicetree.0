Hi Sascha,

thanks for the comments.

Yes but the problem is that the rates are currently set in 
clk-imx51-53.c which should be generic
to all such platforms whereas, as you point out, there may well be valid 
reasons to choose
different values depending on the board design and / or intended 
application.

The cko case is even worse - due to a board design decision that clock 
needs to have
a frequency suitable for supplying some external chip. We don't want 
board specific code in
the platform clock code and we're trying to get away from board files...

I don't understand why we need a seperate tree for this why can't just
a subtree of the DT be used?

After all the DT already contains "configuration" nodes such as "chosen".

Indeed Documentation/devicetree/usage-model.txt  says:
     "The chosen node may also optionally contain an arbitrary number of
     additional properties for platform-specific configuration data."

So what stops us simply placing the clock-configuration node above under 
chosen? (which already works - just tested it)

If the issue is that hardware vendors should be able to supply a DT 
without knowing
the configuration parameters couldn't that be resolved by letting the 
bootloader
merge DT subtrees this would give us "configtree" without adding more 
code to
the kernel to handle it.

Regards,

Martin
