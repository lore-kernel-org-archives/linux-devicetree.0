Probably "fsl,vf610-soc" would be better than "fsl,vf610-soc-bus".

But the SoC is definitely a h/w block! Despite all the individual
silicon in there, I can even touch the SoC ;-)

But yeah, I understand what you are saying... We model it as a
container, and do not attribute any specific thing directly to it. But
aren't there other containers where we bind to? Is it wrong to bind a
driver to a container, if that driver implements issues concerning that
level..?

The two drivers under drivers/soc/ which implement the SoC bus API and
both use a compatible string on a container level (e.g.
arm,realview-pb11mp-soc in arch/arm/boot/dts/arm-realview-pb11mp.dts).

Are you talking about random drivers under drivers/soc/ or the ones
which implement the SoC bus API? I think that is not the same...

If SoC bus, agreed, it is a mess. Not only its adoption is sparse, the
specification is also interpreted differently across different SoC's,
which I brought up in the past:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-March/333765.html

But it exports really useful information to user space, and that has
real value in practice.
