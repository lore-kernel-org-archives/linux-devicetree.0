And that's no problem to the boot code.  Assuming cluster 0 CPU 0 is the
boot CPU, then:

cpu_logical_map() would need to be initialized as {0x000, 0x001, 0x100,
0x101}.

That's going to be very painful to deal with, because of the restricted
environment we have there.  I guess we need to build some kind of
reverse table in memory somewhere which contains MPIDR mask+MPIDR value+
CPU array index.  Not nice at all.

Right, so what we need is a kernel logical CPU id to GIC id mapping,
which you have in your patch.  You call it cpuif_logical_map() but
as it's specific to GIC, I wonder if it would be better called
gic_logical_map().

I'll assume you mean that it's left to the implementation to set MPIDR
appropriately, and you're expecting implementations to make mistakes
with it.

Tell me: would you tolerate people making mistakes when they implement
an ARM CPU which results in the ISA almost being followed except some
op-codes having bits switched?

If not, then why would you tolerate wrong MPIDR values?  That's precisely
the same kind of bug.  And if we go adding work-arounds now, before
there's a problem, there will be no incentive for people to fix the
hardware bugs during their initial implementation testing.
