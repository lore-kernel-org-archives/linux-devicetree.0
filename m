I kind of prefer mach-hisi's solution though.

Are you referring to the topology map? That one only stores topology,
not what type of cores they are. The CPU capacity part doesn't either.
It only stores the results.

I'll just put it in a helper function.

Works for me. I don't need to change anything. :)
