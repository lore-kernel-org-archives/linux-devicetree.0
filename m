Maybe so, but atleast currently we cannot do it
exclusively in the PM core.

We have things like what you find in
drivers/tty/serial/amba-pl011.c
where pl011_shutdown() puts the pins into sleep mode
on unused TTYs.

The same applies to any unused ports like that, we're
thinking of a way to sleep pins for unused I2C hosts
for example.

And that works fine also on systems that does not
enable CONFIG_PM (so the pin control subsystem
is completely orthogonal). But maybe that is
complicating things? I was just thinking it was a bit
thick to require everything and its dog to make a
complete transition to (runtime)PM.

Yours,
