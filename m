Hi!

I noticed a *LOT* of pointless pullups and missing pullups related
to uart/usart pins. These patches fixes what I found.

I separated out the two changes that had pullup on neither rx nor tx,
since there might exist some reason for that? But a pullup on tx and
a missing pullup on rx is a sure sign of confusion, so I lumped all
those fixes in one big patch.

One or two of the removed comments with duplicate info where wrong
as well, i.e. the info was supposed to be duplicate but wasn't.

Cheers,
Peter
