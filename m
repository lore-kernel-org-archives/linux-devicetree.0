In a recent round of reviews, for the OF case, that led to drivers
which used device_initcall() without being a module, getting a match
and handle to the parent device, and then walking over the nodes
and instantiating child objects (Linux devices usually) in the process.

It was done as a response to the remark from Rob Herring that
we were modeling things in the device tree as devices when they
really weren't, we were just doing it that way because it fits the
Linux device model and it's easier.

So we have that case too.

The question is if it's anything close to generalizable.

I'm uncertain on the whole subject, I called on the others
because of that...

For a while I had Andy Schevenko patch the GPIO and
SFI core too, but it timed out due to no response from Len
Brown. (Maybe I should just merge that stuff!) Do you (Intel) also
want to unify the Medfield SFI thing into this or have you
given up on it?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
