This set of patches adds support for audio on the Qualcomm Technologies ipq806x SOC.

The ipq806x SOC has audio-related hardware blocks in its low-power audio subsystem (or LPASS).  One of the relevant blocks in the LPASS is its low-power audio interface (or LPAIF).  This encapsulates the MI2S port, which is what these drivers are configured to use.  The I2S pins are connected to an external DAC/amp chip.  In addition, a single GPIO is connected to the same DAC/amp, which gives the SOC enable/disable control.

The specific drivers added are:
 - a Codec DAI driver that controls the SOC external pins
 - a CPU DAI driver for controlling the LPASS-LPAIF block
 - a PCM MI2S platform driver
 - a machine driver that ties the three drivers together

Corresponding additions to the device tree for the ipq806x and its documentation has also been added.  Also, as this is a new directory, the MAINTAINERS file has been updated as well.

== Updates from my previous post:

[PATCH 00/9] ASoC: QCOM: Add support for ipq806x SOC
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.msm/10701

 - remove the native LPAIF driver, and move its functionality to the CPU DAI driver
 - add a codec driver to manage the pins going to the external DAC (previously managed by the machine driver)
 - use devm_* and dev_* where possible
 - ISR only handles relevant DMA channel now
 - update device tree documentation to reflect changes
 - general code cleanup

== Additional patch series upon which this patch series has device-tree dependencies (lcc)
