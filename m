Do you want the callers of the mux APIs to know that an optional mux
isn't there, and then have checks at all callsites on optional muxes to
make sure consumers don't call the mux functions? Won't that duplicate
lots of checks in drivers for something the core could treat as a don't
care case? Sorry, I don't understand why the consumer cares that it was
there or not when it is optional.

At this point in the code we're finding the index of a mux-control-names
property so I was trying to handle the case where there isn't a
mux-control-names property at all but we're looking for something
optional anyway. If there is a property, then we would see some other
error if something went wrong and then pass the error up. There is a
hole where there isn't a mux-control-names property and we're looking
for something that's optional, but there is a mux-control property. Do
we care though? The DT seems broken then.

of_parse_phandle_with_args() would return ENOENT when there isn't a
mux-control property in DT. So I've trapped that case and returned an
"optional mux" pointer of NULL. I think we handle the case you mention,
where some index is found but it returns an error, because that would
return some error besides -ENOENT.

Sorry, I'm not really following what you're suggesting. Maybe it got
mixed up with the NULL vs. non-NULL return value from mux_control_get().
