Rob, Mark, Arnd, can you take a decision regarding this binding? This
driver is floating around for quite some time, and we were asked to
rework the binding several times (in time in an opposite direction).

For the record, here is the thread I mentioned earlier [1]. In his
answer, Arnd suggests to put timing and bus config description
outside of the sub-device node. Mark recently complained about this
representation, which led me to the configs/config-X appraoch, and now
Rob suggests to go back to the first proposal.

I'm fine doing that, but can you please all confirm that you agree on
this binding?

Thanks,

Boris
