dma-ranges is generally defined for bridges to indicate the dma window
to system memory, it's not been by actual devices so far. It provides
the opposite of "ranges", ie a translation from children to parent
address space.

So it's not quite the same thing.

Now the fact that we are limited to power-of-2 masks is a Linux
implementation detail. We might want to make the device-tree a bit more
flexible and use something like dma-limit instead. However hardware
limits tend to be in term of number of bits anyways so it's not a big
issue.

I don't see a need to keep a "ranges" type of semantic. If we ever do
that we can do a new binding for it or add a dma-base...

Agreed.

I don't think so. As I said, dma-ranges is about a bridge/bus exposing
DMA windows & translations. It has nothing to do with the device
intrinsic DMA'ing capabilities.
