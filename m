Hi,

This serie brings A10 (sun4i) and A20 (sun7i) SoCs into the
sunxi-ng world.

As mentioned in sun5i conversion, this is pretty much standard
stuff as all the required clocks were already implemented in
the sunxi-ng framework.

TODO: Unfortunately there's still an issue with SATA clocks
which will fail unless u-boot has set up the clocks. Clocks
probably need some extra work to handle fixed postdivider
and multiple parents.

Changes from v2:
 - Rename driver and relevant files to sun4i-a10-ccu.
 - Drop mmc output and sample clocks for sun4i-a10.
 - Rename CSI ISP clock to SCLK as it is called on other variants.
 - Add comment on why PLL6 is used as AHB parent.
 - Fix parents for out_a/out_b clocks.
 - Stop exporting PLL_PERIPH_SATA gate. Driver takes care of gate.
 - Rework SATA clock handling.
 - Fix ahb gate parents.
 - Simplefb clock fixes (add dependencies for HDMI/LVDS clocks).
 - Fixes for pll-ve and pll-video1 clocks pointed out by Jonathan Liu.
 - Adapt to latest upstream changes from sunxi-next.

Changes from v1:
 - Drop useless comments
 - Add support for A10 / sun4i.
 - Rename driver to sunxi-a10-a20.
 - Add previously unimplemented clocks.
 - Document the audio pll hardcoded post-divider
 - Add Acked-by: Rob Herring <robh at kernel.org> on patch 4
