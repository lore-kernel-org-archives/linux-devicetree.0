I'm not aware of Allwinner naming schemes too much, so please correct me
if I'm wrong, but if A20 implies sun7i, then "allwinner,a20-crypto"
would be better indeed.

Whether it was really the first SoC is another thing. Obviously this
needs to be checked, although it isn't really that important. For this
particular naming scheme you need to specify all the SoCs for which
given compatible string can be used for this IP anyway, because there is
usually no other source of information about this available (except
directly comparing two datasheets...).

Best regards,
Tomasz
