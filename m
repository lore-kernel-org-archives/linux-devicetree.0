I don't particularly like this either, but it kind of has been decided.

For the i.MX6 display subsystem there is no clear single master device,
and the physical configuration changes across the SoC family. The
i.MX6Q/i.MX6D SoCs have two separate display controller devices IPU1 and
IPU2, with two output ports each. The i.MX6DL/i.MX6S SoCs only have one
IPU1, but it is accompanied by separate lower-power LCDIF display
controller with a single output. These may or may not be connected
indirectly across the encoder input multiplexers, so collecting them
would require scanning the whole device tree from an always-enabled
imx-drm platform device if we didn't have this node.

Also, we are free to just ignore this node in the future, if a better
way is found.

Yes. It consists of two LVDS encoders. On i.MX5 each channel is
connected to one display interface of the single IPU.
On i.MX6Q its parallel input can be connected to any of the four IPU1/2
display interfaces using a 4-port multiplexer (and on i.MX6DL it can be
connected to IPU1 or LCDIF).

Not yet, I will prepare a branch with the next version.
