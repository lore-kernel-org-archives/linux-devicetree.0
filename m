Hi, I have some more or less trivial comments below.

Should this file have a .rst extension, like other Restructured Text

I wonder if valid should be moved after eaddr, to reduce the need for
padding. AFAICS, struct slim_eaddr is 6 bytes long and requires 2-byte
alignment, so if valid is one byte long, there would be one byte of
padding after it, slightly bloating struct slim_addrt, unnecessarily.
