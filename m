Yes this is one point to clarify. I keep it as a specific API, as i
don't know if another hardware needs to support it...
I would say that objective of this version is to highlight interactions.
Then i can rework it in a way that could be  genericised in future (
i.e. using void* for params that would depend on platforms)...

Extend IIO customer API would be also another alternative, but i did
not find a generic way to do it. Some IIO attributes could be used for
Hw params but DMA and IRQs seems tricky to handle through this IIO
interface...

I did not find physical minimum period limit, that why i considered
this value from a scheduling point of view. I will re-check these values.

I think that the driver itself can not be generic. ST DFSDM is too
specific. Only API with IIO could be.

Yes Completely unnecessary here. Furthermore the driver should be
removed by the IIO driver.
