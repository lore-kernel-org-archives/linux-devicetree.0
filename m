None of the 4 boards that defined this gpio have this pulled low in the
pin control, boards should have an external pull-up on the reset line.

At any-rate, I'm pushing this fix to allow the driver to use new kernel
frameworks that depend on the correct binding being used. This is not a
case of a badly designed binding or trying to add incompatible
functionality, it is a typo fix. If we have to keep this driver back
using old frameworks and needlessly bloat the code solely for the sake
of compatibility with a typo, then DT "stability" here is causing more
issues than it solves. </rant>




I guess the alternative would be to have of_find_gpio() also consider
prefixing, the 'gpio_suffixes' to 'con_id' and checking for those. That
is rather ugly and probably encourages the spread of this bad binding
property, but whatever the best fix is it cannot be to force bloat into
the driver.

Will fix for v2.
