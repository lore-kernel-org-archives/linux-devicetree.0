Grant,

thanks for looking at this. Appreciate your comments.

You mean that early boot code has to read #size-cells and #address-cells 
and act accordingly when parsing the reg property? So just more code in 
early boot? But that would easily open the door for 64bit addresses for 
instance, right?

I don't think Xen in particular has a lot of problems with that. The DT 
implementation is quite capable (see Julien's latest updates).

TBH this initrd syntax looks a bit weird to me in general, not following 
the nice and well defined DT way (no compatible, separate properties for 
start and length, ...)

To me that sounds like a hack to avoid more coding work.
The problem with that is that it would introduce a Xen specific property 
(actually two).
So from a user's perspective you want:

a) generic properties to support future OSes without much hassle (using 
the DT's compatible semantic)
b) specifying load address and length in the normal way
c) adding command lines
d) potentially adding more arbitrary properties
e) allowing an arbitrary number of modules

To just go ahead with another hard-coded property to make life easier 
for us kernel level developers doesn't sound very convincing to me.
And especially supporting multiple modules would be very hackish then.

But this is actually not consistent with the rest of the DT 
architecture. Defining an own node for that looks like a perfect match 
to me in the DT world.

I see your point with early boot code constraints. But my idea was to 
create a flexible and generic solution, so that there will be a 
framework for bootloaders to specify blobs without needing updates every 
time someone comes up with a need for one. On x86 there was once such a 
need for microcode updates which couldn't be easily satisfied because 
Linux/x86 itself does not support the multiboot protocol.

The main driver for this was to avoid patching bootloaders just to boot 
Xen specifically. Rather we want to patch bootloaders to support some 
kind of "multiboot" protocol once and let Xen piggy-back on this. I 
think that is somewhat driven by experiences in the x86 world, were 
especially kernel people are reluctant to support something just for 
Xen's need.

Andre.
