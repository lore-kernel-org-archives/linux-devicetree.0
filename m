Well,
IMHO the diffs in ov965x are smaller (but untestable because nobody seems
to have an ov9650/52 board) than within the bq27xxx chips, but I can dig out
an old pdata based separate ov9655 driver and extend that to become DT compatible.

I had abandoned that separate approach in favour of extending the ov965x driver.

Have to discuss with Hugues how to proceed.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
