This is unfortunate, but this is also the case if the boot CPU is
different.

In that case _this_ patch is broken.

If we associate the interrupt with a CPU by node order, the relationship
is preserved regardless of which CPU is the boot CPU (whether it was the
bootloader's choice, kexec, or whatever).

The order of nodes is presently preserved.
