Grep for_each_node_by_*() and for_each_*_node() (include/linux/of.h)
in the tree to see how often these global device tree searching is
used, you may know how important not having so many nodes is.

This is something I had tried long time before, but it did not get
accepted because:

* It's unnecessary to encode the entire clock tree which is SoC
  specific in device tree.  Clock driver is a good place for that.

* Again, doing so will bloat device tree with hundreds of nodes.
