I had missed that fact; thank you for correcting me!

I see that now.

Assuming you also include any chained irqchip handlers necessary for
those timers or IPIs, that makes sense to me.

Sure.

Given all of the above I'll go back to the IRQF_SHARED_TIMER_OK approach
you proposed, along with documentation updates and comments at usage
sites to make it clear when it is valid to use.

Thank you for bearing with me so far.

Mark.
