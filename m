I don't know, but since the other USB port connected to the hub comes up
fine, I'm assuming it's something to do with the SATA-to-USB bridge.

I'm just trying to say that at the moment, all the connector will do is to
supply power to a connected device (for charging batteries or whatever).

No. I have now tested without "enable-active-high" and then Vbus stays off.
This is also in line with the binding documentation:

"- enable-active-high: Polarity of GPIO is Active high
 If this property is missing, the default assumed is Active low."

It also seems to me that the way this is implemented in Linux, the GPIO
polarity flag is ignored.

Yes, we just don't have a driver for the A80 USB 3.0 port yet.

These two regulators are supplied from a fixed 12 V to 5 V DC-DC converter
which can't be controlled in any way.

I agree, but a lot of work is missing to get to that point. To get the USB
ports up and running, you need to enable quite a few regulators:
1. VDD09-USB for the controller internals.
2. VCC33-USB for the PHY.
3. Vbus for each connector belonging to the controller.
4. Pin group supply for the GPIO pins controlling each of the Vbus supplies.

Nobody seems to have thought about the first and the last two supplies when
the bindings were written. In this case, 1, 2 and 4 will be connected to
always-on regulators anyway. Getting support for multiple Vbus supplies
probably needs something along the lines of what was discussed with your
coupled regulator patches:

Yes. The regulator is capable of outputting the listed voltages in the
750 mV to 1200 mV range, but the permissible range of the consumer is only
800 mV to 1100 mV according to the A80 data sheet. Likewise, the AXP806
regulators support a larger voltage range than that of the connected
consumers.

I put quotes around it because the proper spelling is Wi-Fi, but since that
is a trademark, most people use the term Wifi capitalised in one way or
another (or sometimes not). Grepping the other dts files, it seems customary
to leave out the quotes, so I'll do the same.

Thanks for the hint. I thought the driver would automatically detect that.
The following modes are supported according to the data sheet:

* DS: Default speed up to 25MHz (3.3V signaling).
* HS: High speed up to 50MHz (3.3V signaling).
* SDR12: SDR up to 25MHz (1.8V signaling).
* SDR25: SDR up to 50MHz (1.8V signaling).
* SDR50: SDR up to 100MHz (1.8V signaling).
* SDR104: SDR up to 208MHz (1.8V signaling).
* DDR50: DDR up to 50MHz (1.8V signaling).

Unfortunately, when I enable the 1.8 V modes, or even just SDR-12, the
device fails to initialise with error -110 (-ETIMEDOUT). I will take a look
at that, but no promises.

I don't understand. What would that include file contain? Very few lines
would be shared between .dts files. You could save < 8 lines total if you
#include the 5 lines that are common between the Cubieboard4, the Optimus
and this board.

Indeed it is currently disabled by the kernel during startup, as there are
no consumers listed in the device tree. I don't know what that regulator
supplies, and it is on my to-do list for probing the next time that I have
the heat sink off the board.

I don't have schematics as it's not a developer board. V1.1 of the PCB,
which I have, doesn't even have the component names silkscreened onto it.
