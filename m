Can't it?

	compatible = "fsl-ls1043a-rev11-msi";

Oh, I guess it can!

Joking aside, if there are multiple versions of a piece of hardware
which require *different* treatment by drivers, then it is obviously
wrong to use the same compatible string because *they are not compatible*.

If there is some common level of functionality that *all* variants
support without the driver having to know which one is which, then there
might be some sense in having an additional common compatible to
represent that level of functionality, e.g.

	compatible = "fsl-ls1043a-rev11-msi", "fsl,ls-scfg-msi";

But if, say, new variants turn out to have less functionality, rather
than more, then there's probably not much point, and we should stick to
specific, accurate, compatible strings.

DT is not specific to a kernel version, nor even to Linux. A string
which triggers some board-specific magic in a specific version of a
Linux driver does not describe the hardware.
