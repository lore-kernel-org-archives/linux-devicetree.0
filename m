Hi,

(sorry if I steer the discussion in the wrong direction, I am not quite
sure if you dismiss the idea of staying compatible in general or if you
just point to an issue with my particular solution. Trying to reason
on both below.)

But syscon would only be the fallback, following the DT compatible
string semantics: If a kernel doesn't have a specific driver, it could
use "syscon" to get at least some basic functionality.
In this case I would expect the SRAM driver to be coupled with the DE2
driver requiring it, so we have the SRAM with it and don't need it
without it. So syscon is a reasonable fallback for older kernels.

I understand that from a "designer's" point of view syscon is not really
applicable (see the end of the first paragraph of the commit message).
The problem is: we broke compatibility with older kernels. I missed that
point back when the change was posted, because I thought older kernels
would just follow the syscon phandle. I missed that they require a
"syscon" compatible string in there.
So I am looking for a simple solution to have all the new features but
keep the new DT compatible with older kernels.
(If the reason for staying compatible in this direction is not clear,
see below.)

I don't think that the drivers would conflict on the hardware level,
would they? Even if both would match: A kernel would check the
compatible strings in order: If it matches on the specific string, the
new driver initialises and claims the MMIO region. Any attempts from
other drivers (including syscon) after this point would just fail, on
the ioremap() in Linux for instance. Similar on the other hand: If
syscon is the first getting probed, its ioremap() wins and the specific
driver would fail on probing. But DT's compatible string list semantics
would ensure the proper order. With that slightly awkward behavior for
syscon, which we can fix.

So we won't have the issue of two drivers competing for the same
hardware. I believe this is true for every halfway sane implementation.

I see that and I understand that it probably should have been a
specific driver from the beginning, but that this is always easy to say
at hindsight ;-) And since I don't have a time machine, we need to fix
it somehow differently.

So the practical problem at hand: I can't reasonably push this DT into
U-Boot anymore, so that it gets passed on to EFI apps (grub) and on from
there to kernels: Anyone wanting to boot a kernel <4.19 (Ubuntu 18.04
installer) or some FreeBSD, for instance, will now no longer
have Ethernet. Which worked before, the 4.18 DTs we have in U-Boot
boot >=4.15 kernels just fine. I could keep the 4.18 DTs in U-Boot, but
will loose all the new features and can't update anymore easily.

I see that for the traditional embedded Linux use case this isn't an
issue, but I believe all those SBC boards are beyond that and users
want to boot of the shelf distros (installers) with them. Which they
can right now, but can't anymore with this new DT.

Cheers,
Andre.
