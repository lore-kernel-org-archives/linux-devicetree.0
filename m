Ok, I'll take a look.

Could you point me out a thread (or other documents) talking about gpio 
hogs.
I found this one 
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2013-April/162254.html.

Sure, I'll propose something (I guess your talking about GPIO hogs 
concept not gpio-switch driver).
If you already thought a bit about GPIO hogs, I'd be interested to get 
some inputs (suggestions, ideas, code, ...).

Anyway, thanks for taking time to answer my questions.

Best Reagrds,
