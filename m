OK, thanks.

Yeah, the weblink will be maintained, it explains our TI-SCI protocol
information and we also have couple more references to it. I don't think
the values themselves do not belong to any binding and they are specific
to each SoC. We have initially added them to dt-bindings header files,
but since those files are not really leveraged by any drivers and only
provided macro usage in DTS files, they are being cleaned up. DT nodes
will directly use the required values instead.
