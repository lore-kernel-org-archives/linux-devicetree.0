DT started that way. However, the direction set by binding reviews have
essentially limited DT to only external hardware configuration. So, yes,
we've made things worse. DT, as defined and maintained today, does not
replace platform data since it's been de facto limited to a tiny subset
of system configuration info. Further, the current approach to "breaking
compatibility" with old DTBs that has resulted from the claims of "DT as
ABI" is completely tied to the vision of moving DT independent of the
kernel. Platform data in code never had this compatibility issue.

DT has many benefits. It would be great to leverage them as long as it
doesn't interfere with the rate of change and willingness to evolve code
that's always been the strength of the kernel process. That strength is
too valuable to trade away for the "DT as ABI" vision.

All these failings can start to be fixed by addressing the process and
what DT *is*.
