Ah, so you are designing a node around the needs of a Linux specific
driver. Don't do that. DT describes the h/w and this node is not a h/w
block.

Create a platform device based on a matching SOC compatible string
instead and make your driver find the information it needs directly
from the relevant nodes like the ROM node.

That does not make sense. You can find the ROM node by compatible
string, get the address, get an revision offset property, and read the
address. There's no need for syscon nor regmap here.

So, please describe in the binding doc what the values contain. cfg0
and cfg1 is meaningless. But based on the above, this whole binding
should go.
