However, I am afraid this will make things complicated rather than
simplified.

The function mmc_clk_determine_rate() will need the info which
controller it is, what's the init clock rate, what's the max clock rate,
and what's the limitation, which may be different as different soc, and
can not be hardcoded.
The limitation may in HS200 and SDR104 mode.

The plan is only input init rate and max rate instead of the table,
while others directly use ios->clock, only if the the limitation resolved.

Thanks
