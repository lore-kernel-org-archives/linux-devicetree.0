yes but it can still be split :)

Why not only id_table, see below:

any reason for that? Would the device not announce itself on the bus and
then you can synchronously update the device.

I guess Greg is best person to make this call :)

Yes you are right. Since the device need to be powered up thru side band we
cannot live without using firmware (acpi/dt)

Now consider the below scheme:
 - The Bus scans device node of the controller (acpi/dt), as
   above and find the slim devices and adds them. The ID needs to be
   extracted from firmware (acpi/dt), we sure need to set the right firmware
   node for the device
 - Drivers register based on ID, no need to make it DT/ACPI aware
 - Match function is invoked and driver probed
 - Sideband mechanism kick in and power up device and it announces on the
   bus

In case it is already powered up, it can announce being up earlier.

FWIW i am using above method with ACPI on SoundWire.

wont the controller have its own platform_device?
