I don't quite understand the reasoning behind this conclusion. We know
for sure that those two registers control only those core and ring
clocks. Maybe there are other registers controlling other clocks,  that
we don't know. But for sure, those two registers only give details
about those core and ring clocks, so I don't see what would be the
usefulness of merging that into a single DT node.

We would lose the fact that the relationship between the ring clocks
and one of the core clock is represented in the DT. Instead of having a
clear <&coreclk X> or <&ringclk Y> reference, we would have a
mysterious <&allclk XYZ> reference, which doesn't tell immediately
whether it's a core clock or ring clock.

So, while I definitely agree that a syscon is probably in order to
cover all the system registers, I don't see the point of having a
single node to cover all the clocks.

Best regards,

Thomas
