Hi Xiubo,

My DT is

	sound {
		compatible =3D "simple-audio-card";
		simple-audio-card,name =3D "Cubox Audio";

		simple-audio-card,dai-link@0 {		/* I2S - HDMI */
			format =3D "i2s";
			cpu {
				sound-dai =3D <&audio1 0>;
			};
			codec {
				sound-dai =3D <&hdmi 0>;
			};
		};
	...

I was getting 0x1001 as the format (codec clk & FRM master and i2s').

With your patch, I get 0x4000 (clk master & frame slave and no format).
