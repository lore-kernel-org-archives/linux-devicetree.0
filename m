I was wondering about the same as well... the best option I can think
of at the moment is as follows:
 - out of a 62*9 (558) all combination possible child nodes, only 11
or so are valid for ARM - this is what is represented as child nodes
to msgmgr. rest of the proxies and queues are inaccessible for ARM.
-  move this "valid queue list" as compatible data in the driver.
- for each of the rx queues identified in the compatible data, I can
do of_irq_get(np, rx_queue_index) without enforcing a naming
convention requirement

If I go with the above approach, I loose ability for non queue
interrupts to be identified appropriately... I think moving valid
queue information to driver compatible data and named irq names might
be the best option for flexibility.

Let me prototype this as part of of_xlate and see if I can pull the
qinst data back out.. obviously one negative will be that I will
register *all* valid channels as part of probe.. at least based on
initial code i wrote today morning..
