Some protocol may use signature to identify a packet type.
For example, the remote supports upto 100 commands, each having unique
8bit code. At fixed offset of any payload is the command code. All the
remote needs to do is read the u8 value of predefined offset and use
it dispatch the payload to handler of that command. The command
handler would know the format of such requests.
