Use the specific compatible for AO pwms so the pwms input can
be correctly set

FDIV4 is not present on the pwm A0, so change kadhas vim input
clocks to xtal.

This patch depends on the pwm patchset available here [0]

On the Khadas Vim I chose to replace FDIV4 with the crytal.
Only PWM_AO_B is actually used and It is used for led dimming.
The frequency, as long as it is high enough, does not matter.
Only the duty cycle does. After testing, xtal seems to be fast
enough.

PWM_AO_A is outputed on the general purpose header, but no usage is
defined for it.

It might be bit late for that but I wonder why it defined and enabled ?
Same goes for the other peripherals activated on this general purpose
header.

I know that's what shows the schematics but one could choose to do
anything else possible with it ? like use in GPIO mode, or another
function. In addition, we never which setting will be required ? (eg
which clock source ?).

Should we keep those ? or remove them ?

Resend to correct the typo reported by Neil and update the dependency to
the v2 of the pwm series.
