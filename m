I had a go at the core part below. Does it look like what you had in
mind?

I've given it a go on a hacked-up platform, but I don't have any at91
stuff to test with, so I haven't bothered with the driver portions just
yet.

Thanks,
Mark.

Subject: [PATCH] genirq: allow safe sharing of irqs during suspend

In some cases a physical IRQ line may be shared between devices from
which we expect interrupts during suspend (e.g. timers) and those we do
not (e.g. anything we cut the power to). Where a driver did not request
the interrupt with IRQF_NO_SUSPEND, it's unlikely that it can handle
being called during suspend, and where the IRQ PM code detects a
mismatch it produces a loud warning (via WARN_ON_ONCE).

In a small set of cases the handlers for the devices other than timers
can tolerate being called during suspend time. In these cases the
warning is spurious, and masks other potentially unsafe mismatches as it
is only printed for the first mismatch detected. As the behaviour of the
handlers is an implementation detail, we cannot rely on external data to
decide when it is safe for a given interrupt line to be shared in this
manner.

This patch adds a new flag, IRQF_SHARED_TIMER_OK, which drivers can use
when requesting an IRQ to state that they can cope if the interrupt is
shared with a timer driver (and hence may be raised during suspend). The
PM code is updated to only warn when a mismatch occurs and at least one
irqaction has neither asked to be called during suspend or has stated it
is safe to be called during suspend.

This reduces the set of warnings to those cases where there is a real
problem. While it is possible that this flag may be abused, any such
abuses will be explicit in the kernel source and can be detected.
