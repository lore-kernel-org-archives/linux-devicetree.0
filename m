You need it if you want to verify that you conform to the video-interfaces
binding. And that verification is only needed *if* we want to build upon
the drm_of_media_bus_fmt function so that it eventually support other formats.

Where I'm coming from is this discussion with Rob:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/9/286

I interpreted that as is seen in patch 2/7 and 3/7 in v3 (and v2). True,
I might have read too much into his desire to have something generic,
and that the generic bit only applied to the binding, but 2/7 and 3/7
was how I interpreted that conversation.

This is a valid argument.

I just want something acceptable that lets me set a few bits in a damn
register to my liking, ok? :-)

I'll re-spin with the meat of drm_of_media_bus_fmt moved to a static
function in the atmel-hlcdc driver (and squashed with 4/7).
