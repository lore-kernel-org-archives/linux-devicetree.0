I'd rather say that it's slightly GlobalPlatform specific, but a bit
more flexible.

Initially the TEE subsystem was much more flexible and was criticized
for that.

This proposal is the bare minimum to have something useful. On top of
this there's more things we'd like to add, for example an in-kernel API
for accessing the TEE and secure buffer handling. The way we're dealing
with shared memory need to be improved to better support multiple guests
communicating with one TEE.

What we can do now with the subsystem now is somewhat limited by the
fact that we're trying to upstream it and want to do that it in
manageable increments.
