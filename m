No, it's not the root problem that's causing the BUG/etc, but it is
_a_ problem.  Nevertheless, it's something I fixed - disconnecting
the of_node from the struct device needed one other change in the
imx-media code that was missing at this time.

However, that's no excuse what so ever for the BUG_ON() and lack of
error cleanup (causing use-after-free, which is just another way of
saying "data corruption waiting to happen") that I identified.
