No, what you see is the normal behavior for automatic restart by the
hardware. A bus-off recovery is *not* the same than a controller restart.

The application will start to send frames anyway and will again trigger
a bus-off as long as the electronic problem persists. Flushing the
buffers will not cure the problem.

See above.

OK.
