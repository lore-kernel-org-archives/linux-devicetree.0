Can the source names be improved? There are too many 'vpfe' sources.
Perhaps prefix all with 'am437x-'?

In general I prefer '-' over '_' in a source name: it's looks better
IMHO.

One question, unrelated to this patch series:

Prabhakar, would it make sense to look at the various existing TI sources
as well and rename them to make it more explicit for which SoCs they are
meant? Most are pretty vague with variations on vpe, vpif, vpfe, etc. but
no reference to the actual SoC they are for.

Regards,
