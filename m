The scheme below looks good to me, with minor nits picked...

Shouldn't this compatible value be set up to bind to gpio_i2cmux?  The 
node doesn't seem to be hardware-specific.

Did you mean for the comment above to be associated with the 
"gpio-values-idle" property?  It seems out of place here.

reg =<0>  because this is bus@0
