If that is the agreed approach in devicetree arena I am fine with it. I
have been unaware of this and just looked at the suggestion from Jonas
seeing a solution to the problem at hand.

The board ID and rev in the nvram may not be used if the device has
these stored in OTP. However, the problem is that the device need
firmware+nvram loaded into it before we can start the firmware on the
device. Now if we were to add boardtype and boardrev properties in the
binding to identify the hardware, I suppose a new compatible value would
be required.
