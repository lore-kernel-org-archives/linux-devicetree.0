OK, I was not very inspired when I chose it. I will have a look on
Sebastien review.

The serial port is output through an FTDI on an micro-USB connector, I will
add this information in the comment.

I copied and pasted what have been done on armada-370-rd.dts but I have no
problem to change it according to your comment.

I don't think it is the case here. What I observed is a global 5V and a global
12 V power supply line, and then for each voltage and for each SATA drive there
is a FDC6330L which is more or less a controlled switch.

According to the datasheet of the FDC6330L I didn't see any startup delay feature.
Unless this property was not to describe the hardware but to configure it, in this
case it could make sens to use it.


Thanks,

Gregory
