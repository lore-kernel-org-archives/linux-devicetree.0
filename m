I think, this is only called once, when the i2c adapter device is added in 
i2c_register_adapter(). I2C client devices have these adapter devices as 
their parents, and those devices have "i2c-%d" as their names. Since all 
client devices get destroyed when the adapter is unbound, the above should 
be safe.

Yes, this is the ultimate goal. But the purpose of this patch series is to 
move whatever devices are possible right _now_ to DT. Ultimately all of 
them should be migrated. So, yes, we could try to begin with tca6408, 
because the above hack is certainly the ugliest one in this series, but in 
principle this is just one of several devices, that we have to keep in 
platform data for now and aim at removing these temporary hacks as soon as 
respective drivers implement sufficient DT support.
