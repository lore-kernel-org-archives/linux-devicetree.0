So let's summarize that.

memory-controller@1000 {
	...
	flash@0,0 {
		atmel,<ebi-prop-name> = <value>;
		...
		<flash-device-prop> = <value>;
	};
};

Would everyone agree on this representation?

With this approach, it's a bit more complicated to detect the case
where we want to keep bootloader/firmware config, but it should be
doable (it's much more easier to test for the presence of a
config/timing node than verifying that either all or none of the
mandatory properties are here).

Still remains the problem mentioned by Jean-Jacques: what if the
sub-device takes 2 CS lines. Should we apply the same setting to those
slots?

As I said, this has changed in v5. In v4 we were first retrieving the
config from the hardware and then overloading this config with the
properties defined in the DT.
This ambiguity has gone along with the approach of putting the timings
directly in the sub-device node. In this version, EBI configs are
defined directly in configs/config-X nodes, which means that
- if configs/config-X exists, then all mandatory properties should be
  defined (otherwise -EINVAL is returned), and we can fallback to
  default values for optional properties.
- if configs/config-X does not exist, we retrieve the config directly
  from the hardware

So, with this assumption, we could definitely switch to a boolean
property. The only reason I did not change that is because I find it
clearer to have both modes clearly named than having a property called
atmel,tdf-optimized.

Anyway that's not something I'm particularly attached to, so let's
switch back to a boolean property.
