I can get the gadget working on the ifc6410 device I have. I'm using
this script to test things:

modprobe libcomposite

This is sort of ok (I've seen it before with the HSIC controller on
8074). The extcon is optional and so the error message should be
silenced. I sent a patch to move it to debug level.

I don't see an extcon in mainline for apq8064, but I think it may be
needed. At the least, I see that we're using a PMIC interrupt in the
msm-3.4 kernel for the ID pin and the charger is notifying of vbus
events similar to how smbb is doing it for apq8074.

> [    1.882347] 12500000.usb supply vbus not found, using dummy regulator

This is not great. We don't have a regulator specified on apq8064 so we
can't turn on vbus and really support host mode. This seems to already
be the case on mainline though, so it's not like we're any worse here.
To properly support this we need a regulator driver. I suppose if the
RPM supports it we can just use that, but if it doesn't support this
regulator then we need to port over the SSBI regulator driver to do
native regulator control. So far I haven't been able to test host mode
on apq8064 because of this.

The phy and controller are both probing? If they're not failing to probe
then it's probably the phy that isn't working properly. Does gadget work
without my patches on nexus7?
