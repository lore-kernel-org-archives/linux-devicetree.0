All those restrictions should be constrained by either the machine
binding or the driver for the SoC side though.  I do see why you might
want this, I'm just a bit ambivalent about the merits.

That'd work too.

So you need to say that it's for display purposes.

PCM plus IEC seems fine, it's more the more obscure formats that ring
alarm bells.

Not quite - _KNOT and _CONTINUOUS are options in that bitmap...  in
any case this would be a Linux implementation thing.

That'd probably work, not sure if there's a more idiomatic way of doing
that in DT though.
