I haven't got a g20 to test that, but that's the goal.
For now, g20 is still non-DT, so I think it's best to have a DT-only
driver like this one for the 9x5 family (9g15, 9g25, 9x25, 9g35,
9x25).
When the g20 will move to DT completely, we can drop sam9g20_wm8731.c
and adjust sam9x5_wm8731.c (mainly master clock and widgets it seems)
By the way, maybe g45 could use that also (and SAMA5 ?)

Ok, I'll change that.


Thanks !
