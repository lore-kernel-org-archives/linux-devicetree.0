Ah, I see. I was indeed talking about device tree nodes.

So in this case I would lean towards mapping the actual properties to
member names in struct sun6i_dma_config, in this case something like:
	.auto_clock_gate = 0x28;
	.max_burst_width = 16;

This looks more flexible to me and avoids hard to read code where
property A is used in SoC X and Y, but property B in SoC X and Z, for
instance.
In the auto clock gate case this would result in an easy-to-read:
	writel(SUN8I_DMA_GATE_ENABLE,
	       sdc->base + sdc->cfg->auto_clock_gate);
(possibly guarded somehow to catch that A31 case)

Sorry for the delay in this answer, I see that you kept the
DMAC_VARIANT_ style for your new post, and the end result doesn't look
too bad. But maybe still changing this is not too hard now that you have
more fine grained patches?

Cheers,
Andre.
