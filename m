Then they should probably adopt to OPP, since it was created exactly for
this purpose.   What this patch creates is an alternate way of adding
OPPs using the device tree.  

The point is using a static list of OPPs from boot time simply doesn't
work.  You need the ability to dynamically add/remove OPPs at runtime to
adjust for various operating conditons (or HW bugs) as well as for
thermal considerations.   The OPP layer provides this.

A generic driver should get available OPPs using the OPP layer.

The DT can certainly be used at boot time to create the initial list of
OPPs, but as the list of available OPPs changes at runtime, the only way
to track that is to use the OPP layer.

Sure, but a "generic" driver such as the one proposed is not just for
ARM, and not just for today's SoCs.  
flexible enough

Sure, any system with independently scalable CPUs/clusters.
