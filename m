Does the second sentence apply to just x86? 'KVM_EXIT_MMIO (all except s390)'

I've change this to:

I'm looking at this as just ARM's SMC-CC services, (which looks like too narrow
a view). I had expected the kernel to know which ranges its willing to let
user-space drive, once they have a KVM_HVC_RANGE_ value userspace can try and
claim them.

This fits nicely with the kernel emulating PSCI by default, but looks wrong once
SMC and the immediates creep in too.

Yes, I'd ignored that due to the narrow focus...

The only user we have today is PSCI. It we let userspace specify the x0 ranges
it may try and claim PSCI, or worse only part of the range the kernel uses for
its PSCI emulation. I'd like to avoid these corners.

The logic was the kernel has PSCI emulation so it already knows about particular
ranges, hence the grouping so that only whole ranges can be claimed...

.. but this doesn't fit with exposing the immediate values or SMC/HVC, both of
which have a bigger scope than SMC-CC.

Looking again at Marc's comments on this[0, 1], we could consider an 'all or
nothing' approach. If user-space wants the SDEI or any other range it has to
claim the lot, and emulate PSCI itself. This is more work for userspace in the
short term, but its less work for userspace and the kernel in the long run.

(I assume Qemu already has a PSCI implementation for its TCG mode..)

Ah, I hadn't thought about that, (and I don't know much about how it works).
I assume user-space needs to know which of SMC/HVC the guest made, to route to
the appropriate guest{n}-hypervisor, and these probably need enabling
independently as SMC isn't guaranteed to be trappable, (how can KVM know if
HCR_EL2.TSC is secretly ignored?).


(/me looks at the condition code ESR_EL2.ISS bits for SMC trapped from aarch32)

... I'm not going to get this done this week, and as it no longer has any ties
to SDEI I'll drop this patch from the series and post it independently.


Thanks,

James
