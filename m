Any property you add needs to be documented in the DT binding.

If possible, add generic properties for each bug you have mmc.txt
rather than the driver specific sdhci.txt, and implement the
I will add the binding in mmc.txt. I thought this was present but not.

parsing in a common function that is used for all mmc hosts.
As per mine understanding the sdhci_get_of_porperty is a common
parsing function  . Am I wrong ??

An alternative would be to set all these bits based on the compatible
string of your host, if that is the only one that has all these bugs.

The host driver  (arasan) is reused but this quirks are needed due to
board issues. so I have a control over dtb only to fix this.
