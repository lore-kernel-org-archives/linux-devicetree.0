Ah, so you kept the IOMMU_OF_DECLARE() but it does nothing but define
a table. We already have the driver match table which should pretty
much be the same data, so it would be better if we could use that if
possible. If we used MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE somehow, we could avoid
modifying lots of drivers. Though many built-in only drivers omit
that. The other problem is it would become a large set of tables to
search thru because it is global. That would probably end up slower
than just deferring. So we need something like
<subsystem>_DEVICE_TABLE() to have per subsystem tables. Then this
function in this patch would need to be told which table to use.
However, this is all really just an optimization to avoid deferring at
all and could be addressed later. Is there any data on how much time
you save avoiding deferring? This has come up in the past and I don't
think it is much.

I've also been thinking about if we could use MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE to
provide a list compatible strings from modules as a whitelist of
devices to keep deferring probe on. That would require building
modules to build the kernel which I don't think would work. I think my
conclusion is that the cases we care about may be short enough to just
manually maintain such a list.

Yeah, I didn't give it much thought as I expected more comments on the
general idea... Maybe my poor naming is a good diversion. :)
