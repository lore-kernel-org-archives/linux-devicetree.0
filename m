RPMh itself landed in Andy's tree and he sent a pull request on
Saturday.  Feel free to refer to the request ("[GIT PULL] Qualcomm
Driver updates for 4.19") AKA
<https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10539125/>.

It doesn't look like arm-soc has picked up Andy's pull request yet
though.  If having it in arm-soc is a requirement then I'm happy to
monitor arm-soc and ping this thread again when it's there.

Fair point.  I was thinking that we had pared the driver down enough
now that the bindings were no longer anything other than just
boilerplate bits describing the hardware, but it's obviously your
decision when you're happy to land them.

As per above it's been landed, so hopefully this red flag is removed?
