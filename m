Document the use of references into the hierarchical data extension
structure, as well as the use of port and endpoint concepts that are very
similar to those in Devicetree.

+_DSD
+----
+
+_DSD (Device Specific Data) [7] is a predefined ACPI device
+configuration object that can be used to convey information on
+hardware features which are not specifically covered by the ACPI
+specification [1][6]. There are two _DSD extensions that are relevant
+for graphs: property [4] and hierarchical data extensions [5]. The
+property extension provides generic key-value pairs whereas the
+hierarchical data extension supports nodes with references to other
+nodes, forming a tree. The nodes in the tree may contain properties as
+defined by the property extension. The two extensions together provide
+a tree-like structure with zero or more properties (key-value pairs)
+in each node of the tree.
+
+The data structure may be accessed at runtime by using the device_*
+and fwnode_* functions defined in include/linux/fwnode.h .
+
+Fwnode represents a generic firmware node object. It is independent on
+the firmware type. In ACPI, fwnodes are _DSD hierarchical data
+extensions objects. A device's _DSD object is represented by an
+fwnode.
+
+The data structure may be referenced to elsewhere in the ACPI tables
+by using a hard reference to the device itself and an index to the
+hierarchical data extension array on each depth.
+
+
+Ports and endpoints
+-------------------
+
+The port and endpoint concepts are very similar to those in Devicetree
+[3]. The port represent represent interface in a device, and an
+endpoint represents a connection to that interface.
+
+All port nodes are located under the device's "_DSD" node in
+hierarchical data extension tree. The first package list entry of the
+hierarchical data extension related to each port node must begin with
+"port" string and must be followed by the number of the port.
+
+Further on, endpoints are located under the individual port nodes. The
+first hierarchical data extension package list entry of the endpoint
+nodes must begin with "endpoint" and must be followed by the number
+of the endpoint.
+
+Each port node contains a property extension key "port", the value of
+which is the number of the port node. The number of the endpoint node is
+the index of the endpoint node in the endpoint node array under the port
+node, starting from 0.
+
+The endpoint reference uses property extension with "remote-endpoint"
+property name followed by a reference in the same package. Such references
+consist of the name of the device, index of the port node and finally the
+index of the endpoint node. The port index is indeed index to the referred
+port array, not the number of the port that is related to numbering of
+actual hardware interfaces in the respective hardware. The endpoint nodes
+are always referred to using an index to the endpoint node array.
+Individual references thus appear as:
+
+    Package() { device, port_node_index, endpoint_node_index }
+
+The references to endpoints must be always done both ways, to the
+remote endpoint and back from the referred remote endpoint node.
+
+A simple example of this is show below:
+
+    Scope (\_SB.PCI0.I2C2)
+    {
+	Device (CAM0)
+	{
+	    Name (_DSD, Package () {
+		ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
+		Package () {
+		    Package () { "compatible", Package () { "nokia,smia" } },
+		},
+		ToUUID("dbb8e3e6-5886-4ba6-8795-1319f52a966b"),
+		Package () {
+		    Package () { "port0", "PRT0" },
+		}
+	    })
+	    Name (PRT0, Package() {
+		ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
+		Package () {
+		    Package () { "port", 0 },
+		},
+		ToUUID("dbb8e3e6-5886-4ba6-8795-1319f52a966b"),
+		Package () {
+		    Package () { "endpoint0", "EP0" },
+		}
+	    })
+	    Name (EP0, Package() {
+		ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
+		Package () {
+		    Package () { "remote-endpoint", Package() { \_SB.PCI0.ISP, 0, 0 } },
+		}
+	    })
+	}
+    }
+
+    Scope (\_SB.PCI0)
+    {
+	Device (ISP)
+	{
+	    Name (_DSD, Package () {
+		ToUUID("dbb8e3e6-5886-4ba6-8795-1319f52a966b"),
+		Package () {
+		    Package () { "port4", "PRT4" },
+		}
+	    })
+
+	    Name (PRT4, Package() {
+		ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
+		Package () {
+		    Package () { "port", 4 }, /* CSI-2 port number */
+		},
+		ToUUID("dbb8e3e6-5886-4ba6-8795-1319f52a966b"),
+		Package () {
+		    Package () { "endpoint0", "EP0" },
+		}
+	    })
+
+	    Name (EP0, Package() {
+		ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
+		Package () {
+		    Package () { "remote-endpoint", Package () { \_SB.PCI0.I2C2.CAM0, 0, 0 } },
+		}
+	    })
+	}
+    }
+
+Here, the port 0 of the "CAM0" device is connected to the port 4 of
+the "ISP" device. Note that the port index in the reference is still
+0, as it refers to an entry in the table and not the port node number
+itself.
