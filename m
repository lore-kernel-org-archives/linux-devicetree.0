So the point I am trying to make is that the fix that you have proposed
on this thread is valid. It is difficult to ensure that a per cpu clock
device doubles up as the broadcast source without significant code
changes to the current broadcast code and the timer code.

But the patch [PATCH V3 0/6] cpuidle/ppc: Enable broadcast support for
deep idle states, attempts to overcome the disadvantage on certain
architectures of not having an external clock device to perform
broadcast *without* significant code changes in broadcast or timer.

This patch does not conflict with what you are proposing in this thread
of having a feature flag CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_PERCPU, since the pseudo clock
device that the patch introduces will not have this flag set anyway.

So ideally architectures, without having a planned infrastructure in
them cannot nominate their per cpu clock device as the broadcast source.
And if they do have some infrastructure to support a per cpu clock
device as broadcast source, they should ensure that the device passes
your test as is proposed in this patch. So your fix is valid IMHO. That
said it is still possible to manage without an external clock device for
performing broadcast.
