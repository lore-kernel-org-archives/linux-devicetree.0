Sorry, I have not read your old version patchsets before.

The basic ideas are consistent, but details are different. I think your v2 patchset may meet some problem:

-------------------------
+- cpu-map:	This property defines the association of range of processors
+		(range of cpu ids) and the proximity domain to which
+		the processor belongs.

+		cpu-map = <0 7 0>,
+			  <8 15 1>;
-------------------------

1.
I am not sure the cpu ids is logical cpu-ids in Linux or the sequence number of the CPU dt-nodes in dts.
The former case: logical cpu-id is allocated by Linux, we can not ensure that cpu0 is the first CPU dt-node.
The latter case: depend on Linux strictly parse CPU dt-nodes follow the sequence in dts.

2. You should put most codes into /drivers/of/, because it can be shared with other ARCHs which base upon devicetree.

Here is my detailed example:
Examples:
/ {
	#address-cells = <2>;
	#size-cells = <2>;

	memory@0 {
		device_type = "memory";
		reg = <0x0 0x00000000 0x0 0x40000000>,
		      <0x1 0x00000000 0x1 0x00000000>,
		      <0x2 0x00000000 0x0 0x40000000>,
		      <0x2 0x80000000 0x0 0x40000000>;
	};

	CPU0: cpu@10000 {
		device_type = "cpu";
		reg = <0x10000>;
		...
	};

	numa-nodes-info {
		node0: cluster0 {
			mem-ranges = <0x0 0x00000000 0x1 0x00000000>;
			cpus-list = <&CPU0 &CPU1>;
		};

		node1: cluster1 {
			mem-ranges = <0x1 0x00000000 0x1 0x00000000>;
			cpus-list = <&CPU2>;
		};

		node2: cluster2 {
			mem-ranges = <0x2 0x00000000 0x1 0x00000000>;
			cpus-list = <&CPU3 &CPU4 &CPU5>;
		};

		nodes-distance {
			distance-list = <&node0 &node1 15>, <&node1 &node2 18>;
		};
	};
