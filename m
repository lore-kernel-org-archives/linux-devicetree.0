Agree.

There is at least one revision of the SoC happening, but hopefully
it should be compatible with the current DT. ARM usually creates
CoreTiles for the CPUs and uses the VExpress motherboard as the
"expansion board" sort of setup.

Juno is new in this area in that is an 'all-in-one' board. I don't
think we will ever see another board with the Juno chip because
ARM doesn't sell chips, but there might be future ARM boards that
will share features with Juno, so refactoring will be necessary.
Unfortunately, I don't have any insights into the future so I
cannot properly prepare for such case, hence the one file submission.

Best regards,
Liviu
