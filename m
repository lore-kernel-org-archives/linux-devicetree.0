Currently "restart" is not functional on stm32 MCU (at least for 
stm32f746, I will check on others MCU). My fear is if Ludovic made some 
patches to make "armv7m_restart" the default ".restart" function for all 
armv7-m platform, he will not be able to test it on stm32 MCU (as it is 
not currently working). I propose to do it in 2 steps:

1-Keep as you suggest only one board-dt.c file for both (MCU and MPU) 
and remove ".restart" function.

2-Investigate and send patches around ".restart" for both in an other 
series.
