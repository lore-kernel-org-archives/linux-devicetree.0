You are right. There is also this note in "Device clock generation" of
TRM which makes this clear.

"
The PLLOUT stage in PLLC0 and PLLC1 is capable of providing frequencies
greater than what the SYSCLK dividers can handle. The POSTDIV stage
should be programmed to keep the input to the SYSCLK dividers within
operating limits. See the device datasheet for the maximum operating
frequencies.
