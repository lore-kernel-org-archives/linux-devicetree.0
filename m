It's a style. I'm not sure if it's new, but I feel like I've seen
mention of it before more than a year ago (see
arch/arm/boot/dts/tegra30-beaver.dts for an example). The advantage of
doing it this way is we can see all the gpio/fixed regulators in one
place and they're physically placed on a separate bus from the SoC bus.
Typically nodes have reg properties too, so making up fake reg
properties for the regulator nodes when they're on the SoC bus would be
wrong and confusing. If they're under some regulators container node we
can number them from 0 to N and use that for the reg property.

Thanks.

Yes, the driver/binding should be fixed and then this patch can be
corrected and applied. There are no implementations of the DT for this
device upstream in the dts directory so there's no breakage or backwards
incompatibility problem by fixing the driver/binding.
