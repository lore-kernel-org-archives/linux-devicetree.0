This series attempts to standardize device naming and improve
its information for better identification

The values of the "compatible" and "model" device-tree properties
are corrected for some devices, adding complementary information
when necessary

Changes since v2:
- Split dt-bindings patch (too many changes)
- Apply dts patches first (reorder)

Changes since v1 (RFC):
- Add values to compatible property instead of replacing them
- Don't remove "internal" word from Xilinx boards on dt-bindings
- Migrate content of adapteva dt-binding file into Xilinx's
- Sort additional compatible strings alphabetically
  by manufacturer
- Dropped patch that renamed the zedboard development board
  (no apparent benefit)
- Dropped the patch that removed the "zynq" value from the
  compatible strings (breaks the ABI)

Luis Araneda (6):
  arm: dts: zynq: Set correct manufacturer for ZedBoard and MicroZed
    boards
  arm: dts: zynq: correct and improve the model property of dt files
  dt-bindings: xilinx: zynq: Improve boards description
  dt-bindings: xilinx: zynq: Sort entries alphabetically
  dt-bindings: Move Paralella board to Xilinx
  dt-bindings: xilinx: zynq: Add missing boards
