Both Nicolin [1] and Mark [2] asked for the old property to be kept
around for compatibility reasons. Those requests seem to have been
ignored entirely; the commit message doesn't even describe why you
believe removing support for the old property is safe.

So NAK unless this patch is updated to either:

- Keep support for the old property, but mark it as deprecated in the
  documentation (having a warning if said property is used is also
  fine).

- Describe why it is safe to remove the property outright, and both Mark
  and Nicolin agree that this is fine.

The former is the preferred way of doing things, and the latter should
be the exceptional case. We don't even save much here my dropping
support for the old property.

I have no proeprty with addition of the the new property; the rationale
for the new naming makes sense to me.

Thanks,
Mark.
