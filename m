I think the main point is to observe that we are encoding a directed
graph onto DT, so long as the original graph can be extracted the
DT encoding can be whatever people like :)

Right, DT is a tree, not a graph - and this is already a minor problem
we've seen modeling some IP blocks on the Marvell chips. They also
have multiple ports into the various system busses.

I'm not sure this will really be a problem in practice:

Consider:
 - All IP blocks we care about are going to have a CPU MMIO port for
   control.
 - The 'soc' tree is the MMIO hierarchy from the CPU perspective
 - IP blocks should try to DT model as a single node when possible

In that case, the location of a DT node for a multiport IP is now well
defined: It is the path from the CPU to the MMIO port, expressed in
DT.

Further, every 'switch' is going to have MMIO to control the switch,
so the switch node DT locations are also well defined.

Basically, I think the main 'soc' tree's layout is mostly unambiguous
and covers all the relevant blocks.

You woun't get a forest of DT trees because every block must be MMIO
reachable.

It is also the same core DT tree with my suggestion or yours.

Your edge encoding also makes sense, but I think this is where I would
disagree the most:

This now requires the OS to parse this dataset just to access standard
MMIO, and you have to change the standard existing code that parses
ranges and reg to support this extended format.

Both of those reasons seem like major downsides to me. If the OS
doesn't support advanced features (IOMMU, power management, etc) it
should not require DT parsing beyond the standard items. This may
become relevant when re-using a kernel DT in uboot for instance.

On the other hand, this is a great way to actually express the correct
address mapping path for every reg window - but isn't that a separate
issue from the IOMMU/DMA problem? You still need to describe the DMA
bus mastering ports on IP directly.

The side-table concept would keep the parsing completely contained
within the IOMMU/etc drivers, and not have it leak out into existing
core DT code, but it doesn't completely tidy multiple slave ports.

Also, I was thinking after I sent the last email that this is a good
time to be thinking about a future need for describing NUMA affinites
in DT. That is basically the same directed graph we are talking about
here. Trying some modeling samples with that in mind would be a good
idea..

You should also think about places to encode parameters like
master/slave QOS and other edge-specific tunables..

The Zynq is interesting because all the information is public - and it
is a good example of the various AXI building blocks. Imagine some
IOMMUs in there and you have a complete scenario to talk about..

It even has a coherent AXI port available for IP to hook up to. :)
