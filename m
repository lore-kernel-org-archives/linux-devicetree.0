I'd rather see the core get fixed than more muck in the drivers,
especially since things are going in that direction :)

Thanks, I will look into that!

The other issue is that none of the sysfs files are even close to
following the one value per file rule, they are all wrong. I actually
think that nothing in userspace ever uses them and they were only ever
done for debugfs-like purposes.

My dark hope is to move them all to debugfs and entirely out of
sysfs.. But I think it will be through a CONFIG_TPM_SYSFS_COMPAT=y +
printk_once("Stop using these sysfs attributes!") kind of scheme.

Ooh, that looks like it could work well, I will keep that in mind!

So there is a path forward, it is just long :)

BTW, in the final form TPM will require a 2 stage init much like net,
the sequence will be:
 - Allocate the core and driver memory and resources
 - Setup the driver fully
 - Perform TPM commands on the fully active driver to setup the
   TPM itself
 - Register the TPM with the system

Just remarking,I don't see a problem with this and your devm_probe
plan.

Thanks
Jason
