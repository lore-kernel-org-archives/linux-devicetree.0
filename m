If I do that Am afraid that the driver would loose the flexibility of 
selecting different MI2S from DT level. Hardcoding which MI2S can got to 
external or internal codec is something that I wanted to avoid from the 
start.

I will add the shutdown code to reset the configuration.

I will change this to switch case.

Yes, it makes it more clear with link-name property. I will fix this in 
next version.

I will fix this too.
