Hi Philipp,

This series adds a reset controller driver that uses the TI SCI protocol
to manage resets on some TI SoCs. It is a repost of the previous v4 [1]
submission that has already been acked by Rob and Santosh, but with some
minor changes. This series has been waiting for the ti-sci-pm-domains
series to make it to mainline and because of the dependencies against
a DT header file including the device id values. The ti-sci-pm-domains
series is now merged and available in 4.12-rc1.

The main changes in v5 is to drop the include/dt-bindings/reset/k2g.h
file based on some comments received from Arnd on a similar header usage
in the ti-sci-pm-domains series. The ti-sci-pm-domains usage is being
addressed in [2] and this reset series is refreshed to follow the same
rule and drop the reset header file.

Patches are on top of 4.12-rc1 plus the recent Kconfig name change on
the TI SYSCON reset driver [3].

Rob, Santosh,
I have retained the Acks received from you on v4, but I am not sure
since there are some minor changes to the series. Please provide any
comments if you do not agree with the changes.

regards
Suman
