I traced the devm_clk_get() and ran into various error codes, so I
figured I should return error on all the other errors (like ENOMEM, EINVAL
& EPROBE_DEFER) but 'ENOENT'.

But, looking at the errors from Russell's email, it looks like I
should look for both 'ENOENT' and 'EINVAL' and consider both these
errors as 'clock not specified' ?

Can I do something like this in the code for this patchset:

md->core_clk = devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, NULL);
if (md->core_clk == ERR_PTR(-ENOENT) || md->core_clk == ERR_PTR(-EINVAL)) {
	/* clock is optional, without it the default
	 * rate divider register values will be used
	 */
	md->core_clk = NULL;
} else if (IS_ERR(md->core_clk)) {
	return PTR_ERR(md->core_clk);
} else {
	rc = clk_prepare_enable(md->core_clk);
	...
}

Thanks
Arun
