The following set of patches does a bit of rework on the existing
Qualcomm SCM firmware.  The first couple of patches deals with turning
the current SCM into a platform driver.  The next couple are cleanups
that make adding the 64 support a little easier.

I took Kumar's 64 bit support patch and modified it to use the arm_smccc
calls.  This simplified things quite a bit.

Lastly, there are a few DT patches to add the firmware node for a couple of the
supported platforms.

Change from v1:
  * Changed binding to reflect proper firmware node usage
  * Added arch_initcall to populate the firmware device, if present
  * Fixed various review comments
  * Removed extraneous includes from SCM 64 file.
