Thanks for your comments! I will prepare a new version, which will use
/memory node as it was in the first version. I hope that with Your ack
such version can be finally merged.

Well, I'm not sure if it really makes sense to support multiple reg 
entries.
I also wonder how to provide entries for LPAE systems. They are 32-bit 
systems,
but physical addresses can be up to 36bit. How to specify them in device 
tree?

Ok.
