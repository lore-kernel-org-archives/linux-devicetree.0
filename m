This series is rebased onto arm64's kpti-base tag, with v2 of Will's kpti
series[0]. The changes were only due to code moving around, but its now
all been tested together. As before patches 15 and 16 contain the extra
kpti trampoline stuff.

The Software Delegated Exception Interface (SDEI) is an ARM specification
for registering callbacks from the platform firmware into the OS.
This is intended to be used to implement firmware-first RAS notifications,
but also supports vendor-defined events and binding IRQs as events.

The document is here:
http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.den0054a/ARM_DEN0054A_Software_
Delegated_Exception_Interface.pdf

I anticipate once reviewed this series will go via the arm64 tree as it has
an ever closer interaction with the arch code. Despite the bulk of the code
being under /drivers/firmware/.

The relevant change in v5 was a three-way lockdep issue via the hotplug
state machine. (I argue it can't happen, but lockdep doesn't care.) Now the
hotplug callbacks save nothing, and restore the OS-view of registered/enabled.
This makes bound-interrupts harder to work with. I dropped Catalin's ack on
all affected patches.

For your regular boiler-plate cover-letter, please see [1].

Thanks,

James
