In short, I'm ok with it. But please put an explicit

    status = "disabled";

and probably a comment about how/where the peripheral can be
used in the board dts.

I intended to do this for the Banana Pis. Though my original plan
was to enable Raspberry Pi compatible peripherals by default, and
list the other peripherals that are defined by the vendor as
"disabled".

"Defined by the vendor" means that the vendor has some sort of
document associating the gpio header pins with the peripherals,
as shown in:

    http://www.orangepi.org/Docs/Pindefinition.html#CON3_Definition

This should make it easier for the average user to enable the
peripherals. I'm not sure we should list _all_ possible ones
though. That would make the list very large, and some might
end up never being used.
