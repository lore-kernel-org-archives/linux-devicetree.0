The blue led on the Mele A1000 is wired to light up as soon as the board
has powered (it will be on while the gpio is still in input / floating
mode), also its location on the top-set box clearly signals "power led".

Until now we've been treating this as a generic usr function led, which
means that when you plug power into the top-set box, the power-led lights
and then turns off as soon as the kernel loads, which looks wrong.

This renames the led from m9:blue:usr to a1000g:blue:pwr (fixing a copy
and paste error in the prefix while at it) and marks it as default on,
fixing this.
