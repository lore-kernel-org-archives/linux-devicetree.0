So I think the most generic compatible should effectively be the same as 'reserved-ranges', ie this region shouldn't be touched by the kernel.

Than we can build on top of that with more specific compatibles.

I have examples from FSL networking SoCs where we would carve out memory for backing storage managed completely by the HW and Linux wouldn't need to touch it, however we might have a "fsl,qman-backing-store" compat encase we might want some debug code in linux to look at the region of memory.

I've got examples at qualcomm where we have shared data structures in specific memory regions between different processors that aren't cache coherent, so want the memory not to be marked as cacheable by Linux when it accesses it.  Again we'd have a "qcom,smem" prop on top of the "reserved-memory-region".

So I'd like what we come up with to handle these use cases in addition to CMA.

Maybe, "reserved-memory-region" should be "carved-out-memory-region".  To say this region isn't for general OS usage, than compat's on top of that might imply more meaning.
