I don't see how that would work. If the bus is AMBA, it should
only have AMBA devices on it, otherwise how would they be connected?

Whether software is supposed to know care about this is a different
question. The device tree should generally reflect the block
diagram of the hardware, and I would expect the AMBA devices be
on a different level from the rest there.

I think it would be much better to only look at the parent bus for
device to add, never at the device itself. 

If the bus is AMBA, add all devices as amba_device, if it's simple-bus,
add all devices as platform_device.
