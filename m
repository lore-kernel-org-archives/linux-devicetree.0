I've started a common-clk-v11 branch on my GitHub that fixes most of these.
Also submitted "clk: davinci: psc-dm355: fix ASP0/1 clkdev lookups" that
fixes a couple more. I've purposely not fixed the davinci_clk_reset_* functions
since there is already a patch that will remove those functions in the future.

I'll wait a bit longer for DT review before re-sending v11 of this series.
