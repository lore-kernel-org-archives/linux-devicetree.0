Hi Fabio.

You are right. Thanks.
According to the source code printf adds the "-supply" indeed.
I've not verified the code as I got a report for 3.14 that the driver
does not work with vdd-supply in DT, works with vdd property
and the supply was verified electrically.
Now I have to investigate the problem better.

best regards

Janusz
