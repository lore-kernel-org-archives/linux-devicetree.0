I'd prefer not to document it twice in the same file as it is
almost 20 lines long. IMHO it makes more sense to document it under
the dma-client section like it is done presently, because when writing a
dma-client node you need to know what these things mean.

When writing a controller node all you only need to know is
"Must be <3>". A more avid reader now has a nice pointer to scroll
down if they wish to find out more.

regards,

Peter.
