That is a different scenario / different mail thread,
I agree that the solution proposed there should work
for the brcmfmac driver.

But that is _not_ what we're discussing here.

All the above tablets use the same dts file (sun5i-a13-q8-tablet.dts,
sun8i-a23-q8-tablet.dts, sun8i-a33-q8-tablet.dts) while not having
the same touchscreen, as discussed in the past I'm working on a kernel
module to detect which touchscreen is in use and then automatically
update the dt using dynamic-devicetree since creating a separate dt
file for each variant is madness (there is a new revision every few
weeks).

I already have this sort of working and I can detect if a tablet has
a gsl1680 touchscreen (*) and if it is the a082 or b482 variant. Now
we could encode the chip-id (the a082/b482) in the firmware name
at the driver level, but that is still not good enough, e.g. these
2 tablets:

a23-q8h-v3:		a082 a23-tj-a23-q88-v4.0_20140815/GSL1688_A70_FW.fw	 800x480 swapped-x-y
a23-tj-a23-q88-v4.0:	a082 a23-tj-a23-q88-v4.0_20140815/GSL1680E_700_FW.fw	1024x600

Both use a a082 revision gsl1680 but need different firmware files,
since they both use sun8i-a23-q8-tablet.dts, so simply embedding
the machine compatible string in the filename passed to
request_firmware is not going to help.

I hope to get permission to get these firmware files added to
linux-firmware and then the different files need unique names,
and we need a way to specify in devicetree which file to load.

We can do some weird indirect dance but that is not really
helpful, esp. since I also expect users to need to override
which firmware file gets used in certain cases and in that
scenario simply specifying the filename certainly is the most
userfriendly.

TL;DR: we need a way to specify which firmware needs to
be loaded and this CANNOT be derived from the machine
compatible as devices with the same machine compatible
need different firmwares.

Regards,

Hans



*) Not all a13/a23/a33 tablets have a gsl1680 touchscreen, I'm also
working on detecting other controllers
