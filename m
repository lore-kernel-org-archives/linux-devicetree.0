Yes, that's not a problem, but I'd like to be sure this is the way we
want to go before rebasing this series.

Yep, that's my feeling too, but I'm not sure how this could/should be
done.
My problem here is that the pinmux should be requested by the EBI
device because the EBI manages several type of devices and the data and
address signals are shared by all the devices, hence the idea of
defining the nand chip node under the EBI node.
In the other hand, the NFC is not part of the EBI bus, and thus should
not be defined under the EBI node.

This might lead to the NFC device being probed before the NAND chip,
hence the need for this synchronization.

Yes, as said above this is all about pinmux conflicts, the NAND
controller has to request the appropriate pinmux for its NAND chips but
it will conflict with the pinmux requested by the EBI bus (data and
address signals are shared by all the devices connected on the EBI).

I would have preferred this solution too, but the EBI/pinmux constraint
explained above prevents this approach.
What I can do though, is reverse the referencing: reference nand chips
from the nand controller node.

Josh, Brian, any idea to solve this EBI/nand-chip/nand-controller
dependency problem is welcome.

Best Regards,

Boris
