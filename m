Indeed, but it is effectively Broadcom's fault for not providing a git
tree for the customer to pull from in order to preserve the original
authorship, if what was distributed is a tarball of changes against a
vanilla kernel (which is likely to be the case), then all author
attributions are lost.

Not suggesting you change how you deliver code to customers, we have the
same issue in the STB/CM group, except maybe customers care less about
upstreaming so we can do it ourselves at our own pace and using our own
attributions.

I would think that point a) and b) are met by the very fact that the
Cygnus kernel port is GPLv2 code, being a derivative work of the Linux
kernel, and that should be enough.

This is kind of well established things, this has happened for many
Broadcom product lines unfortunately because not everyone is active like
you in getting things upstreamed. Those contributions were still
entirely valid and acceptable for the kernel community.

Maybe we do need a lawyer, Saul Goodman, are you here?
