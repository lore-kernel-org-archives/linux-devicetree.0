I need to see how you want to use this. I'm not completely convinced 
this is necessary as the port number should be meaningful. For example, 
port 0 is video and port 1 is audio. This information is specific to the 
local parent node which could be problematic if you have generic code 
parsing the local node. However, if you know which local port is audio, 
then you know the remote endpoint's port is also the audio port.

In general, all these helpers look okay if you have a user for them.
