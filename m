OK, but I have one concern in the binding as mentioned previous and
again as below.

Not just weird setup, even extending Tx support with this binding is not
straight forward.

Simple example:
Today you have:
		interrupts = <0 36 4>, /* LP-NonSecure */
			     <0 35 4>, /* HP-NonSecure */
			     <0 37 4>; /* Secure */

I don't want to specify Secure IRQ on my platform, which should be fine.
In future a variant of that platform gets Tx interrupts, then I will add
something like below:
		interrupts = <0 36 4>, /* LP-NonSecure Rx */
			     <0 35 4>, /* HP-NonSecure Rx */
			     <0 39 4>, /* LP-NonSecure Tx */
			     <0 38 4>, /* HP-NonSecure Tx */

Now how will we handle this ?

I am just suggesting to use interrupt-names so that we don't depend on
ordering in DT implicitly from first by fixing the binding.

Sorry I don't buy that given that using interrupt-names simplifies
things and also helps to hand any such cases.

When the general practice everywhere in the kernel is to avoid secure
accesses *unless and until absolutely necessary*, I don't understand
*why exactly we need the exception here* ? I am OK if you add that
justification with the first user of that channel. We have seen several
cases/issues around that and I am just looking for a strong reason to
add secure channel support here.

I am just looking for ARM MHU implementation, not any non-ARM MHU.
If look at the MHU spec[1], excerpts below:

PID_4 Register

[31:8]	-	Reserved. Read as zero.
[7:4]	SIZE	Indicates the log2 of the number of 4KB blocks that the 
interface occupies. Set to 0x0.
[3:0]	DES_2	JEP106 continuation code that identifies the designer. Set 
to 0x4 for ARM.

PID_1 Register

[31:8]	-	Reserved. Read as zero.
[7:4]	DES_0	Bits [3:0] of the JEP Identity. Set to 0xB for ARM.
[3:0]	PART_1	Bits [11:8] of the part number. Set to 0x0.

Now by skipping PID4 DES_2 part, you are not comparing the designer
correctly. It may be OK to fix in the driver as you mentioned.
Not sure if it's better to fix AMBA, or just don't use AMBA for
IP with JEP106 code. I don't have any strong opinion there.

Sudeep
