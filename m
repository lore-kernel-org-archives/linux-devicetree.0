So something like:

        firmware {
                compatible = "qcom,scm-apq8084";
                clocks = <&gcc GCC_CE1_CLK> , <&gcc GCC_CE1_AXI_CLK>, <&gcc GCC_CE1_AHB_CLK>;
                clock-names = "core", "bus", "iface";
        };

Seems to work fine.

The caller into the SCM is on the hook for making sure the clocks are turned on.
The firmware people decided to not manage the clocks.  In a perfect world, they
would turn on their own clocks and it would all be self contained.  Sadly, it
isn't going to change.

The alternative is every device that makes scm calls needs to manage the clocks
for the firmware.
