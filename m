Shouldn't there be an I2C bus mux driver to handle this? The kernel
already has support for bus muxes controller over I2C. I think here you
just need to implement the same thing, but with the control via a GPIO.
In the future I hope to implement something similar but controller using
an SoC's pinmux HW (where a single controller's I2C signals can be routed
to different sets of pins on the SoC using its pinmux) - a feature which
at least some Tegra boards use for sharing DDC and something else. Such
a mux can be explicitly represented in DT, with multiple I2C child bus
nodes, I think.
