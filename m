This patchset adds support for around 30 kirkwood bases Synology NAS
boxes. Patch #1 generalized the qnap power off driver so that i can
also be used for Synology devices. Patch #2 and #3 document vendor
prefixes and i2c trivial devices. Patch #4 adds the synology DT files.

v2:
Typo fix in qnap-poweroff.c
Use ricoy stock ticker instead of ricoh
Describe the lego structure of the hardware

Andrew Lunn (4):
  Power: Reset: Generalize qnap-poweroff to with on Synology devices.
  DT: Vender prefixes: Add ricoh, ssi and synology
  DT: i2c: Trivial: Add sii,s35390a, fix ricoh vendor prefix
  ARM: Kirkwood: Add support for many Synology NAS devices
