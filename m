Ok. I remove that from the description. Thanks!

I don't think so. I think what we want is that the kernel just don't 
disable the (from kernel's point of view) "unused" clocks. I think we 
get this from the fact that using 'clk_ignore_unused' is a working 
workaround for this issue.

I don't think so. If there is a user in the kernel of the clock, fine. 
Then hopefully the user in the kernel knows what he is doing with the 
clock and then he should do what ever he wants. As there is a user in 
the kernel, we don't have to care about 'accidentally' disabling it.

Just let us care about the clocks there is no user.

Best regards

Dirk
