I see your patch now, as 7e7a0e67f2c ("usb: ehci-platform: add support for
multiple phys per controller"), and I'm not too happy about the way you
did this.

We already concluded that there should have been a binding change
to go along with this, and that would have caught the fact that you
circumvent the API here by reading the phy names manually. That
part should never have made it into the kernel.

I think we can do this either by defining specific names for the
phy, or by changing the generic PHY binding to allow anonymous
phy references (leaving out "phy-names" entirely), and adding a
proper API for that.

I've added him to Cc here. He clearly didn't know the background about
the DT binding change, and should not need to, but he may have an opinion
on what names we should use.

Ok, no problem with that, let's just make sure we come up with a
good binding for it.
