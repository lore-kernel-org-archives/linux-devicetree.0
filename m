Hi Patrick!

So I started implementing the GPIO_LIB implementation but
I have hit an issue where I would like to get some feedback.

So in principle the gpiolib works, but only if the device is
not asleep and the clock is enabled, which at this very moment means
that the can interface has to be up and running.

So at this very moment the only option that I see would be to
disable the sleep mode which the device enters after probing until
the can-network interface is enabled (which enables the clock and
start the oscillator) - with SLEEP enabled when GPIOLIB support
is disabled.

This is obviously not optimal from the power perspective…

The other option would be starting the clock and oscillator
as soon as a set_direction* (or reques/free) function is called.
(where I would need to start using locks to avoid race conditions
as well as clock usage counters...).

Which of the above is the preferred solution? Are there other ideas
how I could solve this dilemma?
