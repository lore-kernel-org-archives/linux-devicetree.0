One of the central points of DT is that it is an ABI. As such, moving to
a new kernel and continuing to use the same old DTB *MUST NOT* break
anything. Of course, you won't get any features enabled/described in any
new DT if you don't use it.

Why is that reasonable? DT is intended to describe the HW. It is
supposed to be OS-agnostic. Having U-Boot-specific properties completely
goes against that.

What Linux-specific properties are you referring to? The only one I
recall you mentioning (although I'm missing a lot of sleep right now) is
the keycodes in the input binding. While the DT property name for those
is linux,... and the values happen to match internal Linux numbering,
there's absolutely nothing Linux specific about the /concept/ of a
keycode, and some numbering scheme had to be picked. There's nothing
practical or conceptual stopping any other OS/SW-stack from translating
those Linux IDs into something internally meaningful. Conversely, the
concept of e.g. "u-boot,dm-pre-reloc" is not something that translates
at all to any other OS/WW-stack.
