Btw. I wonder if you have really read what I did and what I have
written. At first the need for knowledge of the binding is broken by
design and will never work for any general solution. Second, I've
already written almost the same as you've written in your first
paragraph in my pragraph you've just quoted directly above. And third,
if you like to solve that problem, I just posted a possible solution. ;)

You only have to take it, feel free to so, all the patches do contain a
Signed-off-by which means that I don't care much what you do with them.
