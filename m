I agree, but as mentioned: I am debugging something else, which makes the
system slightly unstable, so I refrained from running longer tests...

Yes - it comes with the 9 (32-bit) register read on every interrupt.
This is actually an optimization to avoid kernel latencies that would 
occur when reading 3 sets of registers separately.
Also longer reads means a higher likleyhood that DMA will be used
by the spi-controller/driver.

I will try to run those and add them to the cover page for V2.

Please look mostly at the device-tree and the main comments about the
rationale and performance optimizations at first.

Feedback on these I could include with V2 of the patch that will
fix also the above mentioned errors and MAB avoidance code.
I should be able to post it later this week.

Thanks,
