Most ARM SoC Linux ports aren't using DT now, so there isn't really an 
older OS case here.  Might as well try to get something implemented in a 
clean way while there's still some chance for it.

A more persuasive case could probably be made about DT bootloader-related 
issues.  Those would have to be converted to use reg-names, also.
