Thanks for the quick review! It's true that compiling without
ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT will prevent ATAG_MEM from getting parsed at all.
However, it will also prevent ATAG_CMDLINE from getting parsed, and the
command line from the Chromecast's bootloader does actually contain some
useful information--notably the mode in which the system was booted
(normal or recovery).

Userspace could conceivably want this information, so it's preferable
for the kernel to boot regardless of whether ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT is
enabled. That's the intent of this patch.

I do agree in principle that ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT should be disabled
whenever possible.
