Hi Geert,

I think I prefer if devices are registered as early as possible and
then only probed on-demand, as registration is very much
device-specific but probing is the same for all devices.

But I think in general we should be doing more things on demand and
depending less on the order in which we mass initialize stuff
(devices, classes, drivers, etc).

Regards,

Tomeu
