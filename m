Yes. Also we should make the difference clear between the possible
parents of a mux and the one the user wants to select. So maybe

'clock-parent' for the possible parents of a mux

and

'selected-clock-parent' for the one the user wants to have.

If a user selects higher rates than allowed for a SoC he's doomed, just
like he's doomed when he screws up the devicetree in other ways
nowadays.

I agree that there will be problems when critical bus timings should be
changed via the devicetree. This would either need special handling in
the kernel or simply should be dissallowed.

Well my first thought was to use normal (of-)platform devices, but as
mentioned this may have some unwanted overhead. In case of the mux
a generic mux could be used, so maybe compatible = "fsl,imx51-clk-mux",
"clk-mux" should do it. In case of a gate we'll probably need a i.MX5
specific variant as these SoCs use two bits for a single gate.

No :)

At least there should be a propagates flag, but there may be more.

I wasn't aware of this page. As I see it I could rewrite my suggestion
so that it extends these clock bindings without really changing them.
I have no code working yet, I first wanted to see how the reactions are.
