I really don't enjoy doing things that way, and I understand the feeling.

I also spent a lot of time reviewing Heiner's patches, only to see comments
repeatedly ignored. You know well how time consuming those reviews are. 

After 7 versions, some comments have been taken into account, some are still
completely ignored, even with Kevin and Neil's warnings. I wouldn't have posted
a competing if things were not stuck.

Like you, I have things far more interesting to do than duplicating efforts, and
I sincerely hope better collaboration can be achieved.

Anyway, thanks for your time and sorry for the mess. 

Cheers
Jerome
