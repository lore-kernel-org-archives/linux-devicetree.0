Ok. Thanks for the explanation.

I understand the desire to make this SoC agnostic and consumer/dt
driven. Constructor pattern and all. Unfortunately the OF clk
provider is a getter pattern; not a constructor pattern. I'm
seriously concerned about the locking here because we're in the
framework creating a clk and tying it into a consumer list which
could cause all sorts of problems if we want to reenter the
framework and register more clks. Recursion abounds and my head
explodes! The recursive clk prepare mutex is not something anyone
should be thrilled about keeping around.

So, just don't do this. Instead, register the clks during probe
that exist for the firmware. That list could be discoverable with
firmware calls, or known based on different compatible strings
from DT that have the soc name in it, or something else. Even
scanning the entire DT tree for

	clocks = <&my_clk_node x y>
	
would be better, but probably hugely inefficient and outright
buggy with DT overlays so don't do it. If the firmware can't tell
us what clks are there, just have a table based on compatible
string and be done.
