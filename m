Not with uboot - uboot has been broken for many years in regard of
being able to load kernel images inteligently - it has to be told
explicitly where to load the image in system memory, so if the uImage
is built for 0x80008000, uboot will load it at that address no matter
if there's RAM there or not.

That interacts with the P2V stuff and makes PHYS_OFFSET be 0x80000000
rather than 0x60000000 - and my guess is that it'll still pass in
memory information describing the RAM at 0x60000000 which may result
in the kernel failing to boot.

There's no way around this with uboot at the moment, and I don't
expect the uboots in the field already on devices to be updated to
solve this.
