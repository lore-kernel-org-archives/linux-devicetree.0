Yes, we tested it here using Linux 4.14 but didn't notice this SPI NOR
does not support the lock.

Humm it is confusing, at least for me that am not used to the this. In
any case, I think for now it is better to include the partitions
without read-only and lock as it is convenient to have access to it
from Linux so we adhere the same partition layout used in Boundary's
Linux fork.
