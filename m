I get the impression that many silicon vendors simply do what they
want when there aren't constraints that dictate otherwise. The
benefits of upstream SW aren't valued by everyone, let alone the
benefits of the HW equivalent - the standardized registers we're
talking about. As such, without some force pushing for
standardization, people won't do it. That force would need to be
either ARM, or the customers/partners/ecosystem consuming the SoCs.

And note that we already have drivers in our product kernels (and
simplified drivers upstream) for all this HW already, so switching
register interface would actually be more work at least in the short term.

Likely the best way to drive this forward is to talk to our silicon
engineers and try and drive this through them. If you can persuade
them, perhaps it can trickle back up to ARM and across other vendors.
If you as an NVIDIA employee can't persuade the NVIDIA HW designers, I
don't expect you could persuade other HW vendors:-)

IIUC, the situation is a little different.

A platform existed that used the 8250/16550. That product got into the
market first (or created a new market). Others wanted to be compatible
with the product, so had to implement compatible registers. Thus,
everyone made their motherboard/chipset UARTs work the same.

However, with ARM SoCs, there are multiple tens of vendors all
developing products at once, and even for different markets, so the
whole "must be compatible with this existing thing" driving force
simply doesn't exist, simply because there is no one single "existing
thing". Systems are also larger, and there are many more SW developers
employed, so there's a bit more ability to deal with different HW too.
It may not scale infinitely, but probably better than it did 30 years ago.
