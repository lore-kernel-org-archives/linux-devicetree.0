Ah no, I would have just done the following in the per-board DTS:

&mdio {
	status = "okay";
};

&usb3_phy {
	status = "okay";
};

&xhci {
	status = "okay";
};

Something like that.

Yes, I think it does make sense to have it defined in the .dtsi file
because it's internal to the SoC, however it should probably be marked
disabled by default, unless a board enables its xHCI controller, does
that make sense?
