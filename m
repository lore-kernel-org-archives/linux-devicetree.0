I have a fix for this. The issue is the early mmu page table needs to 
map the dtb. I later realized this is also may be problem for ATAGs as 
well, so I planned to re-work to make it unconditional and work for 
ATAGs. Or perhaps ATAGs only get accessed with the MMU on later than the 
dtb and everything is okay?

This applies to the DT patch set prior to the one Grant sent out
this week, so it may need updates.

Subject: [PATCH] arm/dt: map devtree blob in initial page table

If the DTB is not in 1st 1MB of RAM, it will not be mapped before
memblock is setup, so map it early. We assume the dtb is less than
1MB and map 2MB so it can be at any alignment.

Some assembly optimizations from Nicolas Pitre.
