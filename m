Alright, i will drop this check since it is causing a lot more
confusion that that is worth. we can introduce it when we finally do
hit an issue eventually with multiple processors trying to transmit on
the same queue manager. that is not a concern at the very immediate
time, so we should be good to drop.

please let me know if you are ok with this.
