Some transceivers need a configuration step (for example, pulling
a standby line low) for them to start sending messages. Instead of a
parent child relationship, the transceiver can be implemented as a
phy with the configuration done in the phy driver. The bitrate
limitations can then be obtained by the driver using said phy
node.

Document the above implementation.
