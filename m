I see. Another option would be to point directly to the registers
you need:

	ocotp-cfg0 = <&ocotp 0x10>;
	ocotp-cfg1 = <&ocotp 0x20>;
	rom-revision = <&rom 0x80>;

We don't yet have an abstraction to access a register from a syscon
reference like this, but you could either roll your own here, or 
add a generic abstraction.

It can be both at the same time now.
