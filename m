I considered that but thought it was a worse solution than the one I
ended up with. It's just confusing to have -I paths that enter an
include hierarchy at different levels like that.

Just see what already happened with the mistake on rockchip, where
Heiko accidentally included <include/dt-include/...> instead -- it'd
be nice to catch that when it happens through tools

It doesn't break dts includes if done together with a change in -I,
but it might break includes from the driver side (or needs another -I
there).

I considered that, but given that we're talking about a few soft links
that we need to find a good home for, it seemed like overkill that
adds magic to the build process. Having somehting that is easily
discovered when looking around the source tree is a lot better.

I looked around the tree for suitable homes for this directory of
links, and the least out-of-place I could find was under scripts/dtc.
You even have a script for uprevving the imported dtc sources, so it's
not like it's causing any problems from that point of view. But I do
agree that it's not ideal -- it was just the least bad option I could
find at the time. Better suggestions are welcome.
