The idea was for the user to have the full context of the problem when getting 
the error (e.g., when using the bitrate method to set the timing parameters, the 
calculated parameters are not otherwise known to the user). But I can do that 
with a separate netdev_dbg and move the sanity check as suggested.

Sure, I can do that for the first check (and add back checking tx_work_done as 
well). That misses to call napi_complete and start interrupts in the case in 
which handling of frames are complete work_done == budget though. But on the 
other hand, then grcan_poll will be triggered once again and then detect that 
nothing is to be done if that is still the case.

However, the problem with skipping the check after turning on interrupts is that 
more frames can have arrived and/or have been sent after calculating work_done 
and before turning on interrupts. For those frames, unless I have misunderstood 
something, interrupts will not be raised and they can get stuck until (if ever) 
later frames once again trigger rescheduling of napi.

Thanks for the feedback!
