Add PCIe RC support for TI's AM654 SoC. The PCIe controller in AM654
uses Synopsys core revision 4.90a and uses the same TI wrapper as used
in keystone2 with certain modification. Hence AM654 will use the same
pci wrapper driver pci-keystone.c

The initial support for AM654 was merged recently [1]

[1] -> https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20180626162615.19194-1-nm@ti.com/

Patch series includes the following
 *) Merge pci-keystone-dw.c into pci-keystone.c so that we have single
    file for PCIe keystone driver.
 *) Cleanup the pci-keystone driver. In certain cases the DT binding is
    also modified since PCIe in keystone has never worked in mainline
    due to lack of PHY support.
 *) Included the PHY driver here for completeness (though the driver
    might go via linux-phy tree)
 *) Included the device tree patches here. Once this series is reviewed
    it'll be sent to be merged via Tony's tree.
 *) Patch to fix ATU identification for designware version >= 4.80 in
    designware core is also included here.

TODO:
 *) Add Endpoint Support for AM654
 *) Send a patch to fix the MRRS after the correct value is identified.

Once this series is reviewed I'll split the series and send to
corresponding subsytem Maintainers after removing RFC in subject.

Thanks
Kishon
