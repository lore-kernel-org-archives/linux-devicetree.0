I agree, I will fix this in next version.

Am ok, to change, did you get activity leds works with any of these 
strings with WLAN or BT?

phy0rx/tx seems to be bit more generic and atleast the name looks bit 
non-specific to wlan.

These names should be documented somewhere, Its very difficult to find 
which names to use unless you read the code.

It would be nice to just provide a phandle to the device which 
led-trigger should use, which makes it clear and explicit.

Does this trigger work for you?
Name is bit misleading though.
