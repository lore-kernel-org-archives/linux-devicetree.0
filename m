so the Fedora 26 kernel that is based on 4.12 is missing uart0 configuration in DT. Adding it to bcm2837-rpi-3-b.dts will allow for btattach to actually work.

&uart0 {
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_gpio32 &gpclk2_gpio43>;
	status = "okay”;
};

It kinda works, but not all of it. This command confuses me.

< HCI Command: Broadcom Write UART Clock Setting (0x3f|0x0045) plen 1
        01                                               .

      Broadcom Write UART Clock Setting (0x3f|0x0045) ncmd 1
        Status: Unknown HCI Command (0x01)

And I am seeing fun stuff like failed frame assembly.

[  888.687594] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: chip id 94
[  888.687821] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM43430A1 (001.002.009) build 0182

[  892.429478] Bluetooth: hci0: BCM (001.002.009) build 0182

Actually not providing the firmware makes the controller work. It however is stuck ad AA:AA:.. default address. Providing the firmware turns the address active. However then it never completes.
