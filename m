It's what ePAPR requires.

The problem is when you have multiple nodes called the same thing, you
need to add the @number suffix to the name, and if you do that, ePAPR
says you must also have a reg property, where the reg property matches
the number given after the @.

See https://www.power.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Power_ePAPR_APPROVED_v1.1.pdf
page 15, 2.2.1 "Node names".

It's the audio input pin number (which is a sort-of bus address.)

As ePAPR requires the reg= property with the @unit-address part, this is
the most sane approach.
