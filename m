But isn't the compatible property supposed to describe the peripheral in
a completely platform-agnostic way?

In fact, it seems it should be on the form

	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g45-rtt", "atmel,at91sam9260-rtt";

where an exact description (the actual SoC-IP) is followed by a more
generic compatible description (e.g. the first SoC that introduced the
IP that is still compatible) (see [1]). This policy seems not have been
followed for at91 though, as only the second (first compatible SoC)
string is generally used. 

Either way, this still leaves open the question of which driver gets
bound to a device if there are more than one driver that matches the
compatible property. I guess this could be solved with a property set
or overridden by the board description. For example:

at91sam9g45.dtsi:

	rtt@fffffd20 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g45-rtt", "atmel,at91sam9260-rtt";
		reg = <0xfffffd20 0x10>;
		interrupts = <1 4 7>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

at91sam9m10g45ek.dts:

	rtt@fffffd20 {
		atmel,at91-rtt-as-rtc;
		status = "okay";
	};

If the device-specific property atmel,at91-rtt-as-rtc is missing,
the rtc-at91sam9 driver probe should fail so that any other matching
driver is probed. Of course, this will only work if the other matching
rtt-drivers also add device-specific properties so that they can be
disabled as well (should the probe order be reversed), for instance:

	atmel,at91-rtt-as-<xxx>;

Which backup register (GPBR) the RTC-time base should be stored in is
currently configurable using CONFIG_RTC_DRV_AT91SAM9_GPBR (and the
address arguably not even a property of the rtt) so the register address
should in any case not be set in the rtt-node of the dtsi.

Instead I think we need the arch code to map the backup-registers and
thus to add a new gpbr-node:

	gpbr@fffffd60 {
		compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g45-gpbr", "atmel,at91sam9260-gpbr";
		reg = <0xfffffd60 0x10>;
	};

We could then use CONFIG_RTC_DRV_AT91SAM9_GPBR for non-DT as before, and
add a new property (or simply replace the boolean) to the rtt-nodes in
the board descriptions:

	rtt@fffffd20 {
		atmel,at91-rtt-as-rtc;
		atmel,at91-rtt-as-rtc-gpbr = <n>;
		status = "okay";
	};

to select which of the four (sam9263 has 20) backup registers to use.

I'm responding to this mail with an RFC-implementing the GPBR and
RTT-as-RTC DT support as outlined above.

Finally, for the record: There are currently no other rtt-drivers, but I
have posted a patch series a while ago to fix hanged boot due to early
spurious RTT (or RTC) interrupts (see [2]). The series uses
"atmel,at91sam9260-rtt" to detect the SoCs that are affected by the
problem, and I guess that is an example of why the compatible string
should merely describe the peripheral (and not its use).

Thanks,
Johan
