Thanks for the testing!

Right, I noticed this problem, but found that it was independent of the
core PM code. UART interrupts are dead, but nothing else is.

It's not a problem with patch 7, exactly, it's a problem with the
irqchip driver which handles the UART interrupt mask (irq-bcm7120-l2.c).
The problem is that with a trimmed down device tree (such as the one
found at arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm7445-bcm97445svmb.dtb), none of the child
interrupts of the 'irq0_intc' node are described -- we don't have device
tree nodes for them yet -- but we still require saving and restoring the
forwarding mask (see 'brcm,int-fwd-mask') in order for the UART
interrupts to continue operating.

This is all a problem because when irq_chip_generic::installed == 0, the
irq_{suspend,resume} functions never get called in irq-bcm7120-l2.c.

Anyway, I think this suggests that irq-bcm7120-l2.c needs a slightly
different semantics to its PM callbacks; they must be called regardless
of whether there are any child interrupts. I've cooked up some patches
for this and will send them shortly in reply to this thread.

Thanks,
Brian
