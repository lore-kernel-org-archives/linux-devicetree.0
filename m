At that other company the various dtb's that was to be picked for a
given product was always to support the various SoC versions; so those
devices always shipped with the mtp board-id and msm-id.

As far as I've seen this is how Qualcomm's Android customers does it.


But as things progress further I do see a need for being able to also
pick the right product and at that point you're right that the vendor
must change their boot loader.
