It is likely that my dtc version is out of date.  dtc -v outputs 1.2.0.  I
will try updating to a newer version of dtc.  The error that I currently
get is a syntax error: "FATAL ERROR: Unable to parse input tree".

Does the device tree binary documentation define any format for negative
numbers?  Unsigned 32-bit integers are clearly defined as bytes in
big-endian order.  I suppose that you could assume 32-bit signed integers
are 2's complement with bytes in big-endian order, but that would need to
be well defined somewhere.

Assuming that dtb has no well defined means of holding a negative integer
value, then what is the most elegant workaround to specify a negative value?
