That's good news.

Thanks, I'll test tomorrow.

That's even better news. I have pushed my my wip branch, which contains
some colorspace work and experiments to pass through query/g_/s_std
subdev calls so bypassing the pipeline can be avoided. Also, there's the
Nitrogen6X device tree that I've been using to test:

Looks good. I wonder if enabling the phy clock isn't part of step 3.
though.
