I'd like that.  We are inconsistent, but I think it's useful to have this
information in /proc/iomem.  After all, it is physical address space that
we can't use for anything else, so I guess you could argue that it's
actually a bug to omit it.

Nope, that isn't how it's meant to work.  After pci_bus_add_devices()
completes, drivers can be already bound to the device, and the PCI core
should keep its mitts off things the driver could be using.  But I think
we've had this problem for a long time, and I haven't looked at it recently
to see how hard it would be to fix.
