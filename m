Hey Marek-

What is the current status of the reserved-memory/CMA device tree support
series?  It looks like it's stalled out a bit since the revert[2].  Hopefully
this series is a push in the right direction?

---
This set is an adaptation of Marek's original patchset posted here[1],
and then subsequently reverted here[2].  In [3], Grant proposed a new
set of bindings after discussion in Edinburgh.

This is a partially complete implementation of these proposed bindings.

It's functionality is now split into two pieces, the first of which
implements a default/fallback behavior for reserved-memory nodes; that
is, reserved memory nodes describing fixed-address static regions will
be unconditionally reserved, regardless of their intended use.  In
addition, it provides an interface for adding additional reserved-memory
types, using a method similar to CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE().

The second piece uses the above method to provide support for
reserved-memory nodes whose compatible = "shared-dma-pool".  It makes
use of CMA when available, and when a describing node has the 'reusable'
property.

There is basic support for dynamic allocation of memory reserved
regions, however, noticeably missing is support for additional
restrictions (use of alignment and alloc-ranges properties).
