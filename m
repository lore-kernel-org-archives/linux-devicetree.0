In my opinion it makes sense to get rid of the distinction between CPU objects
and CODEC objects in this case and instead introduce some kind of DAI container
object. I mean the distinction is mostly for historic reasons from a time where
it was only possible to bind a the cpu_dai of a link to a CPU DAI and the
codec_dai to a CODEC DAI. But these dais both can for example be bound CODEC
DAIs. I think to have a common base here would allow us to do some cleanups to
the ASoC core and also avoid the duplication with snd_soc_of_get_cpu_dai_name
and snd_soc_of_get_codec_dai_name which was introduced in this series.
