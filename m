Correct.

no, these are not tiny. boot0 is 24KB to fit the initial embedded SRAM
(not cache), but boot1 is on pair with u-boot in size and runs from
DRAM.
 
boot0 do NOT read the script.bin at all. It can't, there isn't space
fore it. There is tools in the build process that reads the script.bin
and adds some information to a header of boot0, but it's irrelevant to
the device tree question. Exactly the same can be done from a device
tree, or from a fex, it does not matter.

even most of boot1 is not using script.bin. The important parameters are
all recorded in a heaeder of boot1 when the image is composed using the
Allwinner pack tools. Currently based on those tools reading script.bin
to prepare the boot1 part of the image.

No. That info is in the boot0 and boot1 file headers, not script.bin.

Calm down. It isn't really a significant difference to them outside of
the kernel. They do not need to change any of their configuraiton
methods, only a small toolchain change in how the resultig images are
built to have a corresponding device tree built.

But it is a fair bit of one-time changes kernel side. And some
scratching to figure out how to use/improve/ignore the stuff being
mainlined.
