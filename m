There is lots of things in the kernel that aren't necessarily a good
idea.  From what I've seen of early platform devices, I'm not thrilled
with the approach.  If Russell & crew think it is the right solution
for ARM, then I'm not going to make a big stink about it, but I cannot
say I like the model.

For registering devices from the DT, it is definitely problematic in a
way that it isn't for non-DT.  When using the DT, how does the
platform know which devices should be registered as 'early' devices?
And once that is done, the population code has then ensure that
devices registered early don't end up with duplicate registrations,
while not difficult, it does complicate both the code and the
conceptual model of registering DT nodes as devices.  I tried to
implement something very similar with of_platform_prepare(), but when
I look at the result I'm just ashamed with myself.

>From my perspective, there is a very limited set of devices that need

>From what I've been told, timers are currently called directly by core
code, and need to be reworked to allow multiplatform kernels.  irq
controllers (or at least the root ones) are initialized with (struct
machine_desc*)->init_irq().  lldebug is currently selected at build
time so that it is available right from head.S.  That's a pretty small
list.  Everything else is just another device, and I don't see
fiddling about with early registration or fiddling with init order to
be a maintainable approach in the long run.  Doing so means that for
each system, someone has to /choose/ which devices are special, and
the decision could be different for each board, and for each kernel
version.  It would be far better to have a driver model that treats
all devices as peers, and is intelligent enough to handle ordering
issues gracefully.

This isn't a big deal for non-DT because using individual board .c
files makes it easy to encode those per-board decisions, whereas the
DT model is a whole lot simpler if a generic & consistent approach can
be used.
