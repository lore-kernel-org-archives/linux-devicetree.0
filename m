I don't think that's exactly the same property, but it's the same idea I would
prefer to go with. That way, an integer can be passed in via the firmware tables.

Yes, you can use DSD in a way that is similar to OF properties

The reason why I think it should dynamic via firmware tables is that

* It's much less invasive for vendors to update their DT tables if they need to
adjust on a per device/controller/family/etc basis then to adjust a properties
table in xhci-plat
* This would lead to less polluting in xhci-plat code

I will provide an updated proposed patch sometime this week. I also hope to get
some feedback from Mathias to see what he prefers.

Thanks again for the feedback Rob.
