Sure... but I'm still a total nincompoop with regard to FDT.

Let's suppose I do:

	offset = fdt_path_offset(fdt, "/memory");

but that returns -FDT_ERR_NOTFOUND.  Now what?

If I look at the documentation for fdt_add_subnode():

/**
 * fdt_add_subnode - creates a new node
 * @fdt: pointer to the device tree blob
 * @parentoffset: structure block offset of a node
 * @name: name of the subnode to locate
 * [...]

I have no node offset, and can't find the offset for the parent of an 
nonexistent node.  Should I use 0 for parentoffset here?  I'm guessing 
that "/memory" is at the top level so there is just no parent.

Excellent!

FRom a quick code inspection, fdt_open_into() appears to be fine with 
both the source and destination pointers being the same, right?

This is perfect.  The environment where I want to use this code is 
fairly limited indeed.
