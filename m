thanks for the detailed information.
IMHO, linux-numa code does not care about how the hardware design is,
like how many boards and how many sockets it has. It only needs to
know how many numa nodes system has, how resources are mapped to nodes
and node-distance to define inter node memory access latency. i think
it will be simple, if we merge board and socket to single entry say
node.
also we are assuming here that numa h/w design will have multiple
boards and sockets, what if it has something different/more.

i am not able to understand fully, it will be grate help, if you
explain, how we capture the node distance matrix using
"ibm,associativity-reference-points "
for example, how DT looks like for the system with 4 nodes, with below
inter-node distance matrix.
node 0 1 distance 20
node 0 2 distance 20
node 0 3 distance 20
node 1 2 distance 20
node 1 3 distance 20
node 2 3 distance 20
