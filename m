It's WiFi that is already enabled, not eMMC. Only one of the three
variants has WiFi.

We can't even remove a node from a device tree? Removing the WiFi node
from the current tree would make it correspond to the variant with the
least features.

About device tree overlays, I read overlay-notes.txt, but I went
looking for an example with "git grep /plugin/ arch" and it came
empty. Is this approach not used for other boards?

Does the overlay approach make the device available at boot time? That
is important for a storage device such as eMMC.

I went with the separate dts approach because that's what I saw was
done for other similar cases, like Pine64 and Pine64+, OLinuXino-LIME2
and its variant with eMMC, among others.
