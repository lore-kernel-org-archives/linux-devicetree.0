I see.  So your real concern is that controllers shouldn't have two
means of obtaining size.  Restricting messages to be fixed size sounds
very, well, restrictive.  So we either need to represent the size as
part of the payload or insist on a message-end delimiter.

Arnd's idea of placing the message size as part of the send_message()
call is fine, but it's still going to end up in the payload isn't it?
Or else the recipient isn't going to know the length.  And what about
receiving?  Again, it'll need to be contained, or we won't know how
big the message the co-proc is trying to send.
