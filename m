Is it acceptable to re-word the commit message in susbequent versions?

Yes, good point.  I like clarity myself.

OK.

Is there anyone else or another list that should be CC'd in this case?  Thanks.

You're right.

Oops, yes.

Well OK, but I didn't bother because it's explicitly set to one elsewhere in
this source file.

Yes, much better.  Thanks again Thierry.
