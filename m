Well, the kernel will runtime adjust the DT, so, both, I'd say?

You're going to have a different config anyway, but yeah, that's true.

I think we need to discuss this with Pantelis and what is his feeling
about this.

Pantelis, to sum things up, we have a case of a tablet that comes with
the exact same board, but coming in two flavours with two differents
screen resolutions. It looks like a great case for your DT quirks
work, but we have no way of runtime detecting the difference between
the two variants. What do you think about this? Should we go with
using the DT quirks or is this simply out of scope?

There's not so much example of similar cases in the kernel, and none
of them use quirks so far (obviously) but they all boil down to either
the solution you were suggesting in that patch or adding the alternate
configuration as a comment.

I don't think the latter would work for you, and I agree with that, so
I guess that depending on what Pantelis says, either we go with a
better solution using the quirks, or we end up using what you
suggested (with a nitpick though, I'd prefer if you used the display
standard instead of the resolution, which would make it xga I guess?)
