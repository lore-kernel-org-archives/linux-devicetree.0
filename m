The relationship is the fixes tag points was selected to the last tag 
when the commit applies directly against (and is far enough back that it 
covers any possible LTS kernels that would have needed it). In this case 
I don't care too much about whether this is fixed in LTS or not.  If 
needed I'll send a request for the commit be ported to stable.
