This binding is going down the wrong path. Please look at how
drivers such as sunxi-ng have done the binding in comparison to
original sunxi design. We don't put this level of detail into DT,
instead we put the details into the driver code and have clock
controller nodes in DT. A quick glance shows that this binding is
making a node per-clk, which is not going to be accepted.
