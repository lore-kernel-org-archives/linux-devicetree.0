Other CODECs drivers expose some kind of platform/machine specific
function(s) to send the jack definition to the CODEC, we seem to be
missing a generic way to report jack information up to the machine layer
driver.

Perhaps a struct with a jack enable/disable and call-back functions
could be created when registering the codec/platform component driver?
Then machines can hook to this as they need?
