Does the silabs,disable-state of 3 (SI5351_DISABLE_NEVER) take care
of this?

Otherwise is there a simple registration that will do this?

Yes the clocks are generated and do not get effected by the driver.

I have been battling this chip for a while now as it is on a few
different products I have dealt with.
