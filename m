This however the correct way to do this. You should have a phy driver,
and a regulator driver, and a reset driver. The DWC3 then uses
phandles to these drivers.

How is the IO map area 65b00000 split up. Can you cleanly separate it
into sub areas, which do not overlap, so you have a sub-area for the
PHY driver, a sub-area for the regulator driver and a sub-area for the
reset area? If you can cleanly split it up, you don't need an MFD. If
however the registers are in overlapping areas, you do need an
MFD. The MFD core provides access to the registers, while its children
implement PHY, reset, regulator etc.
