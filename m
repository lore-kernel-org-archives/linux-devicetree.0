I disagree with this point.  There are likely to be many unclaimed,
but perfectly gateable clocks in a system, which will consume power
unnecessarily.  The clk framework does the right thing by turning all
unclaimed clocks off IMHO.  This only leaves a small use-case where we
need to artificially claim some which must not be gated.

The other way to do is, as you mentioned is list the clocks which must
stay on in the clock source node, but this will still require a
binding.  It will also require a much more complicated framework
driver.

    clkprovider@xxxxxxxx {
            always-on-clks =3D <1, 2, 4, 5, 7>;
    };
