Please put the djtag binding in a new file. 

It's clearly unrelated to many other things in this file, which should
also be split out.

The djtag driver is irrelvant here.

If there's a realtionship between the two, please define that in the
binding rather than implicitly assuming it in the driver.

This looks messy. Why is this syscon and a simple-mfd?

We should kill off / deprecate the syscon binding. It's completely
meaningless.

This sub-node needs a binding document.

These properties are completely opaque

I don't follow the above. This describes an ALGSUB system controllerm
but the documentation below is all about djtag.

Thanks,
