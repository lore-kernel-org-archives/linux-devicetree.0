But is there much difference between the two? How much code would
actually get built for one chip but not the other? If all the
differences can be run-time detected from the device tree, I
think it's better to not have different compile-time options at
all.

Ok. How about converting this to an global function in common.c that is
called from clk_local_onoff_enable instead?

Yes, there is no practical difference in the way they are defined at
the moment, but the __raw_ versions are still wrong, you should
really never be using them from driver code.

Ok. But why do you need to know the soc type? If it's only for the
uncompress.h code, it should probably stay local to that file.

I think you should do that, too. Forgot to mention it.

Are there any devices hardwired to your PCI bus that require more than a few
bytes of I/O space? If not, I think it should be 64KB. No known add-on
cards require more than that, and it would just waste virtual address space,
and prevents us from using the new common PCI I/O space helpers.

Fair enough. Best drop it for now then. The PCI code is currently undergoing
some changes, and when someone wants to get this to work, they should can
probably better start from scratch with an independent bus driver that will
end up looking much simpler than what you have today.
