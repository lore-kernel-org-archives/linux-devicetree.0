My preference would be for you to add at least one other (tested)
device.  However, in your case I know where you live, so I can throw
tomatoes at your house if you don't upstream more device support
promptly! ;)

When will you be enabling more devices?  If the answer is 'never',
then creating an MFD is a waste of time.

Isn't power-up and reset also done in probe()?

What am I missing?

So why can't it just be 'irq' like most of the time?

What is the 1 in reference to?  Will there be a 2?

If it's possible for it to be a local variable, then it should not be
placed in device data.
