Yes, I am using this in 3.10. On 3.10 the ranges at the mbus level has
to match the hardwired address mapping in Linux.

0x82000000 is part of the OF PCI spec, it indicates the address space
is memory (vs io, vs prefetchable memory, etc)

The 0x1 is an arbitary unique value that matches the next ranges. It
would probably have been clearer if it was MBUS_ID(0x04, 0xe8)
instead...

If you can't predict where your BAR will be assigned when you create
the DT then you could update the ranges value at runtime in your pci
driver before probing the children. A bit hacky.

Yes, you are right!

0x10000abc is the address, xxxx is the size, reg always has address +
size
