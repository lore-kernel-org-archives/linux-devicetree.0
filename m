I thought about that, but it does not allow us to control the
resource activation/deactivation order.

In some drivers the suspend() path could be:

- pins to sleep
- clk_disable
- disable external regulator
- release power domain

In others:

- clk_disable()
- disable external regulator
- pins to sleep()
- release power domain

Ulf Hansson ran into this a while back.

Just like with the notifier approach, this approach assumes that either
the ordering above doesn't matter, or that it is the same for all drivers.

Well, it could also define that e.g. the "sleep" state is optional.

I'm sort of scared about imposing too strict usage patterns as
it may cause more problems than it solves even if the code
does look simpler.

I don't know. Having say regulator, clock and pin handling in the
driver itself also gives a nice encapsulated view and sense of
control when just reading that one driver.

As one developer put it he does not really like that bus notifiers
are doing things behind his back. The debugging of the
driver can become very hairy, as you trace through bus
notifiers etc to find out what is wrong with your pins/clock/voltage.

We don't have hogs, bus notifiers and the like for regulators,
and IIRC Mark disliked the idea. Basically I think it's better if
all resources are atleast handled the same way.
