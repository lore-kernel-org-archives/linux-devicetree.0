Yes that happens (sometimes).

That is possible and in the other thread on this there are some
links to some boards which actually already do this, but from a dt
pov it feels wrong. If we know only one of a set of options will
ever be there we ought to describe things like this in the dt.

Functionality wise this has 2 advantages:
1) We stop probing needlessly once a device is found, in some
cases the majority of the board variants has dev a, and some
have dev b / c. Then putting a first in the to-probe list will
save probing b / c on most boards.

2) Not all i2c chips are easily identifiable, so in some cases
one may want to put dev x as last to probe, because the
probe solely consists of: "Does something ack i2c transfers
at this address".

No, I purely use android os images / SDKs as a source of how the
hw works, I do not have any intentions to try and get android up
and running with mainline on these boards.

Ack.
