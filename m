A lot of the ordering is SW driver dependencies. I'm not sure how much 
of that can accurately be claimed as HW dependencies. As such, I'm not 
sure that putting dependencies into DT would be a good idea; it doesn't 
feel like HW data, and might well change if we restructure SW. It'd need 
some detailed research though.
