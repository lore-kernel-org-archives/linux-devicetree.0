See new message by Alexandre.

Actually, the current convention is explained here:

You're right, 66 MHz is the maximum frequency for all USART and UART on 
this sama5d3 SoC.

The disappearing of this table is a bug in the latest datasheet. I can 
see that the one "11121B–ATARM–08-Mar-13" still have it. I report this 
issue to the team in charge of datasheets (it will be certainly fixed 
for next release of this document).
