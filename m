Hi Arnd,

Many thanks for your time.

Since these common properties are documented in the common clock binding [1]

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

I will add explanation in this file like I do in other bindings
introduced in this patch, and will address 'reg' which probably is not
similar to the common usage.

They are PLL clock configuration registers.

Different PLL has different configurations which listed in pll_cfg.h,
and probably has different number of registers for storing
configurations, and on some Spreadtrum's SoCs PLL clock configuration
registers aren't consecutive, but all PLLs on all Spreadtrum's SoCs
(at least so far) are using the same driver.

I also realized our implementation might not be easy to be understood,
but I haven't thought out a better solution considering the hardware
limitation I explained above.

This actually represents which bits in the register of this clock
should be used for selecting clock inputs, so it depends on how many
clock inputs this composite-clock includes.  Also different
composite-clock has different combination of clock inputs.

I will rephrase this description.  This represents which bits in the
register of this clock should be used for setting the value of
denominator (more exactly to say that the value plus 1 as
denominator).

All chips that Spreadtrum has made so far have the similar h/w design
on clock gates, only the meaning of each bit in their registers is a
little different.

The 'sc1000-gates-clock' has dedicated registers respectively used for
setting and clearing gate clocks.

Like documented in this binding, 1000 means the address of registers
for setting is the address of gate clock control register plus 1000,
and clearing registers plus 1000 * 2, the similar with
'sc100-gates-clock'.

All these three kinds of gates indeed are being used on SC9860.

Ok, will address this.

Thanks for the review,
