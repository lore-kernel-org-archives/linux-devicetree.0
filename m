I think the abort is already fixed in the kernel now on boot so option 1 
and 2 were not needed - and abort handler was removed as detailed by 
Rafal in the commit.  Only outstanding issue is now this new PCI 
enumeration issue.

Option 4 sounds like the proper solution - check the range the abort is 
due to the PCI device enumeration and only ignore those aborts.

Since I don't use BCM5301x option 3 is fine by me.
