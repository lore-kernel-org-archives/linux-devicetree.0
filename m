yes please, have a look at the bt3wire.c code that I send and see if you =
can make it work with Realtek controllers.

On the RPi3 with the Broadcom controller it kinda works, but firmware =
loading and btmgmt power on/off seem to have issues. The power on/off =
might be caused because I moved the serdev_device_open and link =
establishment into the hdev->open callback and don=E2=80=99t clean up =
properly on hdev->close. However I really think it belongs there and =
thus we should make this work. You will notice that the link =
establishment is also kinda slow (at least on Broadcom devices) where =
the messages only happen once per second. We can try to send every 250 =
msec and see if that changes things. If the Bluetooth stack is powered =
down, we should also not have the serial device opened. On USB it is the =
same since it is bound, but no URBs are active.

For me the real advantage of a standalone bt3wire.c is that we no longer =
have spagetti code through hci_ldisc.c and hci_serdev.c and hci_*.c =
drivers that got rather complicated to follow.

On a side note, in btuart.c, I put all the serdev settings into the =
hdev->setup callback, but I think with bt3wire.c that is not possible =
due to 3-Wire protocol. So I assume we need vendor_open, vendor_close =
and vendor_setup additions in bt3wire.c

Marcel
