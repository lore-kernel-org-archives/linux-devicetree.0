In unidirectional bus architectures with non-CPU bus masters, the
classification of flows as "upstream" or "downstream" is nonsensical.
There is only a single direction at any point: the topology derives
completely from how things are linked together.

Trying to orient the topology of SoC architectures can be like trying to
decide which way is up in an M. C. Escher drawing, but with less elegant
symmetry.  While the CPUs would be clearly placed at the top by almost
everybody, it's generally impossible to draw things so that some of the
topology isn't upside-down.

This wouldn't matter, except ePAPR DT does make a fundamental difference
between upstream and downstream: only a single destination is permitted
for upstream via "dma-ranges": the parent node.  For downstream,
multiple destinations are permitted, because a node can have multiple
children.  We can add additional logical children to a node without
radical change to the way traversal works.  But allowing multiple
parents is likely to be a good deal more disruptive.

With dma-ranges, unless multiple logical parent nodes are permitted for
traversal then we have no way to describe independent properties
or mappings for paths to different destinations: ePAPR does not allow
you to pingpong between upstream and downstream directions.  You
traverse in the upstream until you reach a common ancestor of the
destination, then you traverse downstream.  Towards the common 
ancestor there is no chance to describe different paths, because
there is only a single parent node at each point.  From the common
ansestor transactions from all masters follow the same paths through
the DT, so there is still no way to describe per-master-per-slave
mappings.

The "ranges" approach solves this problem, which I believe may
be important if we want to describe how ID signals are mapped via
the same mechanisms: we know that there really will be per-master-
per-slave mappings for IDs.

There may be other solutions, or aspects of the problem I still don't
understand properly ... (likely!)

We should probably revisit this.  It sounds like you got what I
was trying to do here, but my text above may make the rationale
a bit clearer.  Maybe.

We have a ready-made way to describe things like 30-bit DMA in
a quite generic way, if traversal is through a node with

	ranges = < 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x3fffffff >;

(or similarly, dma-ranges).  Deducing a 30-bit mask from that
is not hard.  A DMA mask actually does the same thing as a ranges
property, but in a much more limited way (which can be a good thing).

As commented on the other branch of this thread, I think I agree with
this general approach.  We shouldn't have to do it that often, and it
keeps some complexity out of the core binding.
