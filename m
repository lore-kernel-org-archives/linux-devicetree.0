I think the bigger issue is that the tty/serial subsystem does not have
power sequencing support. Here we're trying to use rfkill to do that,
but that doesn't seem to be what it was intended for. It might work with
standalone USB bluetooth controllers that don't need any special setup,
since the device will just appear and get registered. But it might not
work so well with UART based adapters that need userspace fiddling with
firmware and hciattach.

And like Icenowy mentioned, the bluetooth stack registers another rfkill
control, which presumable just blocks transmissions.
