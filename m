I've got another idea here: using "/memreserve/" field.
All the memory regions used by the crashed kernel would be added
as "/memreserve/" and be memblock_reserve'd later in crash dump kernel.
Consequently, they will be excluded from the usable memory.

Obviously,
- this approach will work both on UEFI/ACPI and DT-only systems, and
- patch#2 ("memblock: add memblock_cap_memory_range()"), as well as
  "linux,usable-memory-range" property, is no longer necessary.
  (So nothing new, except for "linux.elfcorehdr," will be invented.)

But on the other hand,
- arm64 and ppc do the different ways even though both are DT systems,
- those reserved regions are still *in* linear mapping and appear as
  "System RAM" in /proc/iomem, and
- this may imply that we cannot do kexec on crash dump kernel.
