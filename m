Yes, as there are so many drm drivers now, it's time to do this work I think.
I'll try to send a separate patch for this soon.

will removed .load/unload in v3.

I would talk to sti guys about this. Not sure how to handle this now.

I can move this mali dependency to user drivers (such as gralloc and
xf86-video-armsoc).
Do you think it is reasonable?

will remove drm_platform_init in v3.
