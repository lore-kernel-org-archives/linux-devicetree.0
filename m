There is no need to actively get in people's way or put up barriers to
people who do in future decide to upstream things, that doesn't help
anyone.

If this patch adds ACPI support then the patch description was clearly
not great (I don't think I read the patch itself since the description
just said that it was removing platform data without giving a reason,
that's the main review comment here).=20

If you want to use the device property stuff that's fine but there's no
need to remove platform data to do that, it's a smaller change.  I find
it hard to see the platform data as a particularly big blight on the
code here, looking at the driver it's just going to remove the "pdata."
=66rom a few variable accesses which isn't exactly transformational.
