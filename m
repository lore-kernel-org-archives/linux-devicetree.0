 From the following call paths:
   |--> pci_enable_msi_range
    |--> msi_capability_init
     |--> arch_setup_msi_irqs
      |--> arch_setup_msi_irq
and
   |--> pci_enable_msix
    |--> msix_capability_init
     |--> arch_setup_msi_irqs
      |--> arch_setup_msi_irq

It serialize when a PCI device driver tries to allocate multiple 
interrupts. However, AFAICT, it would not serialize the allocation when 
multiple drivers trying to setup MSI irqs at the same time. I needed 
that to protect the bitmap structure. I also noticed the same in other 
drivers as well.

I can look into this more to see where would be a good point.

It works this way because of the direct mapping (as you noticed). But I 
am planning to change that. See below.

I'll provide appropriate warnings.

Not quite sure which of the above questions.

I was running into an issue when calling the 
irq_domain_alloc_irq_parent(), it requires of_phandle_args pointer to be 
passed in. However, this does not work for GICv2m since it does not have 
interrupt information in the device tree. So, I decided at first to use 
direct (virq == hwirq) mapping, which simplifies the code a bit, but 
might not be ideal solution, as you pointed out.

An alternative would be to create a temporary struct of_phandle_args, 
and populate it with the interrupt information for the requested MSI. 
Then pass it to:
   --> irq_domain_alloc_irq_parent
    |--> gic_irq_domain_alloc
      |--> gic_irq_domain_xlate
      |--> gic_irq_domain_map

However, this would still not be ideal if we want to support ACPI. 
Another alternative would be coming up with a dedicate structure to be 
used here. I noticed on X86, it uses struct irq_alloc_info. May be 
that's what we also need here.

I don't intend to waste yours or anybody's precious time. Sorry if it 
takes a couple iterations to work out the issues. Also, I will try to 
put more comment in my code to make it more clear. Let me know what 
works best for you to work out the issues.
