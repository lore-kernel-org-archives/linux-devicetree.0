As we finally need the SRAM controller on these new SoCs (for VE on all
SoCs targeted by dwmac-sun8i, and for DE on A64), should we deprecate
the syscon and all switch to device regmap (and let sunxi-dram driver
to export a regmap)? (As in the A64 DE2 thread discussed, two device
nodes shouldn't cover the same MMIO region.)

In addition, there might be multiple registers in the syscon/sram zone
that are needed (for example, if a version driver is written, it will
need the "0x24 Version Register"; and GMAC needs "0x30 EMAC Clock
Register"). How to deal with this if we export the syscon/sram zone as
a generic device regmap?
