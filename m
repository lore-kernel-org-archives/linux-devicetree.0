Likely nothing at present. I was starting to see what looked like 
SMP-pen-related issues just in U-Boot, before even attempting to boot a 
kernel at all. So, I didn't put any though into how to communicate this 
to the kernel.

This issue would probably explain that; if the kernel just happens to 
allocate a physical page of RAM that overlaps the SMP pen memory.

A /memreserve/ in the DT would probably solve this. Adjusting the 
content of the /memory/reg property to remove the SMP pen would likely 
work too.

Is there no way to disable CPU1..n other than using an SMP pen in 
memory? If the CPUs simply weren't executing anything at all, but could 
be unblocked/powered-up/... later, that'd simplify life.
