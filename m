I need to shoot Thunderbird for all kinds of reasons unrelated to this.
I actually am having to alternate with another laptop right now to do
email because this Thunderbird build I am running is just so sluggish
and nasty (and the other laptop setup is what is broken). But anyway,
that's something I need to fix, thanks for fixing the CCs.

I agree with you. I got worried on Friday when I saw a discussion
effectively leading with (what I read as) "let's ban all ACPI", which
really got me concerned. But then again, I've been in bed most of the
weekend sick, so I probably miss-read your intention. I apologize.

I believe we can skip a lot of other conversation if I can summarize
something from this thread. Is it the case that you believe there is
room for both codepaths to exist in the upstream kernel, and for ACPI to
mature over time as it becomes "more ready"?

If the above is the case, then I don't think we disagree at all! I don't
want to kill DeviceTree, I just know (or think I do) that ACPI is going
to be the dominant force on v8 server systems. It worries me if there's
no way to let ACPI code be merged upstream until it's completely figured
out. I hope I am reading the rest of the thread correctly and understand
instead that you're saying there can be a path for both, and perhaps
those of us who require ACPI can simply state that up front and work
with partners to ensure support for those ACPI platforms is available -
and binding fixes to the standard made - while those same server
platforms might also be supported by a DeviceTree at the same time for a
period of whatever transition is required. That seems totally
acceptable. I don't see any reason why the same binary kernel image
can't boot with either a DTB or an ACPI table and indeed that would be
my preference. Some of us can require it be ACPI by policy, but others
can build kernels that use DTB on v8 servers if that's what they need
while the whole thing shakes itself out.

Gah. I didn't mean to come across as offensive. Just worried. I'm in an
uncomfortable position that there are limits on what I can share about
what people are doing. I don't like or enjoy this one bit. I am pushing
for various things to change. I know it sounds like I'm sitting in a big
room with a Dr. Evil style conference table going on, but that's not the
reality. I *really* truly want ARM servers to be successful in the
marketplace and I know it will only happen (longer term) with ACPI. But
I agree the ACPI story is very much a work in progress right now. I just
want to know that there can be an upstream dual/stack ACPI story while
this is figured out - waiting years for that is going to be very
unfortunate to the overall cause. I wouldn't sound so passionate about
this if I weren't totally convinced of this reality.

Jon.
