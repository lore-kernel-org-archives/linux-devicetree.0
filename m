Sure, will clean the documentation and try to minimize the unknown 
components. Provided these details for better understanding of the flow.

Agree, we are working on making per-file key (PFK) driver generic to 
support any file system.

Understand the point here, we will consider this refcount while working 
on upstreamable PFK driver.

Will clean the documentation.

before upstreaming the PFK drivers, we will try to avoid private pointer 
dereferences to achieve better abstraction to file system.
