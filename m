Subject: [RFC PATCH] ARM64: dts: Add support for Meson GXM
Date: Mon, 14 Nov 2016 10:44:11 +0100
Message-ID: <20161114094411.30199-1-narmstrong@baylibre.com>
Return-path: <linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
To: khilman@baylibre.com, carlo@caione.org
Cc: Neil Armstrong <narmstrong@baylibre.com>, linux-amlogic@lists.infradead.org, linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org, devicetree@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: devicetree@vger.kernel.org

Following the Amlogic Linux kernel, it seem the only differences
between the GXL and GXM SoCs are the CPU Clusters.

Simply add a meson-gxm dtsi and reproduce the P23x to Q20x boards
dts files since the S905D and S912 SoCs shares the same pinout
and the P23x and Q20x boards are identical.
