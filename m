Thanks for all the feedback!

I shall incorporate those into V2.

I thought /* fall through */ is only needed for the cases
where there is code involved in each case block and you want
to fall through to the next block - checkpatch only  complains 
in such conditions (there is one location in the driver -
in mcp2517fd_can_ist_handle_status - that requires /* fall through */).

Also Documentation/process/coding-style.rst shows such an example
in the “indentation” section, so I would assume this is valid code.

Well - this is only in case of Device Tree - no need to include
all the DT-parsing in case that there is no DT support in the
first place…

I may arrange it as a #ifdef outside of the function 
(like the other case you have mentioned).

I took the mcp251x as a blue-print and I believe it follows the
same pattern… 
But I may have simplified things during early driver development, 
so I will recheck it.

See above - I shall look into it...
