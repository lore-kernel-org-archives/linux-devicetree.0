Oh, I see. Sorry.

It seems this HW has been designed to just set that configuration up
once and be done with it.

There really isn't a way to make anything more complex or dynamic work
correctly. If you try to put the debounce config into a per-state node
rather than the top-level, how will you reconcile any conflicts? What if
the gpio-keys default state's node says 10ms, whereas the SDHCI
controller's default state's node says 100ms? Both those states need to
be active at the same time. The only way to avoid conflict resolution
issues like that is to prevent them, and just put the debounce config at
the top-level, and hence program it once when the driver starts, i.e.
make the DT exactly match the HW capabilities.
