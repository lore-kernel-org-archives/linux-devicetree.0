The ranges and dma-ranges properties belong into parent, not child here.
I guess that's what you meant at least.

Right.

That seems counterintuitive to me. When a device initiates a transaction,
it should look at the "dma-ranges" of its parent. The "slaves" property
would be a way to redirect the parent for these transactions, but it
doesn't mean that the device suddenly translates ranges as seen from
its parent.

In other words, "ranges" should always move from CPU to MMIO target
(slave), while "dma-ranges" should always move from a DMA master towards
memory. If you want to represent a device-to-device DMA, you may have
to move up a few levels using "dma-ranges" and then move down again
using "ranges".

That doesn't seem very helpful or intuitive though. If I have
an IOMMU that N DMA masters can target, I don't want to have
information about all the masters in the IOMMU, that information
belongs into the masters, but the format in which it is stored
must be specific to the IOMMU.

Ok, ignoring those oddball cases for now, I'd like to first
try to come to a more useful representation for the common case.

The "ranges" property here is really weird. I understand you
mean this to be a device that has a unique mapping into its
the slave (the root device here). I would reduce this to one
of two cases:

a) it sits on an intermediate bus by itself, and that bus
has the non-default mapping:

/ {
	dma-ranges;
	ranges;

	bus@x {
		ranges;
		dma-ranges = < ... >; // this is the mapping
		master@1 {
			...
		};
	};

b) the device itself is strange, but it's a property of the
device that the driver knows about (e.g. it can only do
a 30-bit DMA mask rather than 32 bit, for a realistic case),
so we don't have represent this at all and let the driver
deal with the translation:

/ {
	dma-ranges;
	ranges;

	master@1 {
		...
	};

};

As I said before, I'd consider this a non-issue until anyone
can come up with a case that needs the complexity.

A possible representation would be to have two masters
as child nodes of the actual device to avoid having a 'slaves'
property with multiple entries, and if the device is the only
one with a weird translation, that can go to some other bus
node we make up for this purpose:

/ {
	ranges;
	dma-ranges;

	fake-bus {
		dma-ranges = < ... >;
		slaves = < &{/} >; // is the default, so can be ommitted
	};

	bus {
		ranges;
		// no dma-ranges --> no default DMA translation

		device@1 {
			master@1 {
				// hopefully will never be
				// needed in real life
				slaves = < &{/fake-bus}>;
			};

			master@2 {
				slaves = < &{/} >;
			};
		};
	};
};

>         master@3 {
>                 slaves = <&root>;
>         };
> };

Here, the slave is the parent device, which is the default
anyway, so I wouldn't require listing anything at all,
besides an empty dma-ranges in the parent node.

If we can get away with just a single entry in 'slaves' all
the time, we could actually rename that property to 'dma-parent',
for consistency with 'interrupt-parent' and a few other things.

Freescale already has 'fsl,iommu-parent' for this case, a
'dma-parent' would be a generalization of that, but less general
than your 'slaves' property.

Hmm, that would actually mean we'd have to do complex "dma-ranges"
properties with more than one entry, which I had hoped to avoid.

Makes sense.
