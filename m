If the memory is truly reserved for a purpose and cannot be used for
anything else, I don't think it should be in the memory node at all, and
should be carved out. That aligns with what you'd do in UEFI (either not
listing the region in the memory map, or listing it with attributes such
that it may not be mapped and/or used).

I don't see much of a reason for /memreserve/, as it can cause issues
(by allowing the OS to map the region with cacheable attributes), and is
not as rigorously specified for ARM as it is for Power in ePAPR.

I understand that reserved-memory is for carving out (potentially
reusable) memory pools for devices or other special uses (perhaps a
panic log). Usually such memory may also be used by the kernel for its
own purposes if not presently required by the device.

Having an entry in reserved-memory does not necessitate the region also
appears in memory nodes, and if a region cannot be used by an OS (or
other software) for other purposes, I would not expect it to be describe
in any memory node. That will prevent other software (e.g. bootloaders)
from erroneously using the memory.

If you have a region described with no-map, I would expect that this
doesn't exist in any memory node or the UEFI memory map, and is only
under reserved-memory so it may be referred to by phandle in a
consistent manner.

I'd expect shared DMA pools to appear in reserved-memory. The OS can
choose to use these or ignore them if it chooses (or is otherwise forced
to, e.g. were it loaded over one).

Thanks,
Mark.
