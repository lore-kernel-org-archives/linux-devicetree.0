I've been thinking this morning about ways to at least
improve this.  The problem is worse than just prerequisite
clocks polluting the global name space.  Right now *all*
clocks get their name registered this way, because any one
of them could be tagged as a prerequisite, and therefore
in need of lookup by name.

If I had a device structure to associate the clock names
with it would help, but I don't have one.  There is no
other way to define a separate name space, it's either
associated with a device, or it's global.

Given all that, I could prefix or suffix the clock names
with some special string, in order to sort of carve out a
reserved portion of the global name space.

I could specify the prerequisite clock by its index in
its CCU's clocks array.  I could then manufacture a
of_phandle_args structure and use of_clk_get_from_provider()
to look up what we need, but that seems kind of kludgy.
Maybe a new function could encapsulate the messy details
of that.

Do you have any suggestions?  I can create some new
common code if appropriate, but only if it represents
missing functionality that's generally useful.
