DTB time selections are a separate thing to Kconfig changes like Kenneth
was proposing.  They're more viable though it'd be a lot better to avoid
needing them, designing out the possibility of doing something is often
a sure fire way of finding a user.

But is it possible to configure the TrustZone firmware to leave things
open?  That's the tricky case.

Actually, can we read the configuration TrustZone did?  That might be
the best answer here, the DT can describe the silicon and then we can
check at runtime which bits of it we're actually allowed to talk to.
