once we get the GPIO expander driver upstream, I think we also need this for RPI 3 and Zero W. Right now we can just not do anything about this.

However we can start looking at the PCM setup and see how that one is wired up and see if we can feed that into ALSA or wherever they terminate that.

Making ACPI serdev aware and turning BTH0 into serdev nodes is really the next step. That would allow us to simplify the drivers and remove duplicate code. Do you still have access to ACPI based tablets with Broadcom chips? It would be great if you can take a stab at this.
