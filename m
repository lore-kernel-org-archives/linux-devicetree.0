I'm concern about using simple-bus, and I'm not entirely sure this will work.

AFAIK, you can't correlate a parent-child relationship in the device tree
to the order in which drivers will be probed,
so it's only a matter of coincidence if this is working for you right now.
The GPMC code is in "arch/arm/mach-omap2", is located *before* the mtd code
in the Makefile, and thus the GPMC driver loads *before* the MTD code.

Morevore, I believe that when we move GPMC from arch/arm/mach-omap2
to drivers/memory where it should be, this 'simple-bus' will stop
working properly.

Of course, I can be wrong, but I think you will have to find some other way
to initialize the GPMC's childs.
