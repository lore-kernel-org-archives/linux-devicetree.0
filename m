that early ...?

You should fix the incomplete information problem. I pushed back on
this, you got more information and already the binding is closer to
reality.

Mark didn't say don't submit. First, there is value in submitting even
if not accepted immediately and you have to carry some patches for
some time. It was also suggested that you err on the side of less
information in DT if things are uncertain and you have not done that.

Atmel has had a year now with that statement. Time to remove it IMO.

I think we need to only allow this at a binding level and not at SoC
family level and also require a timeline to marking stable.

True, but it is still an exception and I never said I wouldn't push back.

You want us to agree, then you won't like the answer. Bindings must be
stable. I'll allow exceptions to that, but not without push back.

In general, if there is disagreement about whether stability is
required, then it is required. See the recent sunxi discussion. That's
more between users and platform maintainers though.
