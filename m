So not nice.

So I'd home some guy would go grep the sources and hopefully find that
very similar functionality is already present.

That's a problem? I mean, the other code is inactive anyway and is only
a couple of KBytes. So not a big deal IMO.

If that becomes a problem with embedded, we can always do ugly ifdeffery
and Kconfig games if absolutely necessary.

The unnecessary fragmentation of xgene_edac functionality. I would like,
if possible, to concentrate all xgene RAS stuff in one file, like x86
does. And then there's the talking between the two aspect below...

But if we split <vendor>_edac stuff per IP block, that will become a
problem. So we better talk about it now.

Thanks for that background info, it helps a lot.

Ok, what if they're related through RAS?

I.e., xgene_edac contains all RAS-specific functionality of the xgene IP
blocks. This doesn't sound silly to me, frankly, and it concentrates it
all in one place. Communication between blocks is trivial and there's no
code duplication.

Other vendors using those IP blocks would simply add new DT descriptions.

So we do that on x86 - amd64_edac does AMD per-family setup and sb_edac
too, for the last 4 Intel uarches. And it works just fine. So if "silly"
is the only problem, I can certainly live with it.
