No.  Device tree maintainers has told that.  Looking into the clock DT
binding discussion, you will find that Grant does not like to have
even 100~200 nodes to represent an entire clock tree in the DT.

With your proposal (actually this has been proposed long time before),
to represent the pins for a 24bit display, it easily consumes 28 nodes
on mach-mxs, while my binding only needs one node.  So in short, the
proposal has been discussed and it's not a sensible one.
