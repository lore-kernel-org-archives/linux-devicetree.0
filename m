Samsung has different versions of I2S introduced in different
platforms. Each version has some new support added for multichannel,
secondary fifo, s/w reset control, internal mux for rclk src clk and
tdm support. Each newly added change has a quirk. So this patch adds
all the required quirks as driver data and based on compatible string
from dtsi fetches the quirks. This also adds i2s support on exynos5420
and make relevent changes in the dtsi files.

Changes since V1:
	- Pass quirks as driver data and fetch the quirks based on
	  compatible string from dtsi file as suggested by
	  Tomasz Figa and Mark Brown
	- Make the I2S driver more flexible with respect to register
	  access as suggested by Tomasz Figa and Mark Brown
	- Add 5420 support in the driver.
	- Modify the dtsi files with the corresponding compatible
	  strings and removed the i2s quirks from 5250 dtsi file.
	- Updated the i2s Documentation with relevent changes and
	  i2s versioning info.
	- Add i2s nodes on exynos5420.dtsi
	- Enable sound support on smdk5420

This patch set is dependent on the following dma and audio subsystem
clk controller patches.
