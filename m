In the of_iommu case it's not actually an optimisation, but dodges a big 
problem with the self-contained implementation - if we blindly defer on 
a not-yet-present IOMMU until all built-in drivers have had a chance to 
register themselves naturally, then by the time we could safely assume 
the relevant IOMMU driver *isn't* built-in, all the clients (which may 
include the boot device) can already be stuck on the deferred probe list 
with nothing left to kick it and make progress again. It's quite 
possible I could have done better, I just wasn't very familiar with the 
driver core at the time, and repurposing the magic table instead of 
entirely removing it was by far the easiest way forward.

With this patch we would have a guarantee that the deferred list gets at 
least one kick after the deadline for waiting has passed, so in theory 
we could then just use the regular driver matching mechanisms to see 
whether a given IOMMU node can possibly probe or not. I'm not sure we 
could get rid of the driver introspection aspect entirely, since it 
might be the case that the IOMMU itself has dependencies and winds up on 
the deferred list behind one or more of its clients, in which case we'd 
still want them to keep waiting even after the deadline is nominally up.

FWIW we did get rid of the equivalent table completely for the arm64 
ACPI code, but that only has to support 2 types of IOMMU so just 
evaluates the respective driver config symbols directly with 
IS_BUILTIN(). Sadly that method really can't scale to DT with multiple 
compatible strings per driver...

I guess there's also the possibility that a single driver may want 
multiple behaviours, if e.g. if SoC variants A and B have some identical 
peripherals but slightly different pinctrl/IOMMU/etc. hardware such that 
A has workable default behaviour and can be treated as optional, whereas 
B absolutely must be controlled by the kernel for the consumers to 
function properly, and they *should* defer forever otherwise. I think 
that would pretty much demand some sort of explicitly-curated 
white/blacklist setup at the subsystem or driver level.
