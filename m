Thanks. Please see my response inline.

Yes, the PCI ID is in the host side driver which will be included in patch v5.

Yes, we always have UEFI available.

Good information! Currently this FIFO is mainly for mgmt purpose. I'll try the threaded 
IRQs approach to see whether it can be easily converted and make it into the v5 patch.
If not easily, probably a separate commit to improve it later?
