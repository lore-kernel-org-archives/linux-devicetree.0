As per the internal TRM, there *only* 2 rx interrupts to the public
world ARM on K2G. I just noticed that the public TRM conveniently
stripped out every single useful information and replaced with
TRM!!!!!*&^*&^&*%&^%&%&!!! Anyways, checked internal documentation to
verify as well. we have multiple output paths to various compute
systems, but only 2 receive paths.

Ofcourse a different SoC will have different integration, which why
the interrupt list will have to be compatible property.

Thanks for the review. will wait for Rob and Jassi or post a new rev on monday.
