The point was this isn't the only scenario where the absence of a
property means something, and where you might want to delete the property.

Doesn't seem that bad to me except in the case you show below where
you're trying to do it programmatically.

Yeah, that's unpleasant.

I don't hugely object to a new boolean type for use in new bindings,
where <0> or absence can both be used to indicate false, as long as it's
clearly documented.  I'm hesitant to start doing this on existing
bindings, though, and in any case would like to see support for
property/node deletion in dtc.

It's basically the same as the above, right?

We normally want to work with existing device trees (which could be
partially produced by firmware, so changing can be unpleasant), so the
absence of the property is still going to be a possibility.  Plus
enumerating every possibility, no matter how rarely used, in every node
of a certain type seems excessively verbose.  It's not like these are
user configuration knobs.
