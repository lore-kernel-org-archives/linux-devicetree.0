Hi,

this is the forth version of a series adding support for the USB
cluster which is on the Armada 375 SoC. We can mainly see this device
as a PHY muxer.

Since the last version I no more use a global variable and store it
now in the platform data as suggested by Kishon. I also add a new
patch adding myself as maintainer of this driver.

While I ran coccicheck on my code I also found some possible
improvement in the phy driver: it was done in the 1st patch.

The second patch was a patch initially submitted by Andrew. This patch
added the mvebu-phy.txt but fell through a crack when adding the
driver. I join this patch on my series in order to be able to add the
new binding for the USB cluster of the Armada 375.

This was done in the third patch.

The forth patch was the addition of the phys driver itself.

The fifth and sixth patches are updating the device tree files related
to the Armada 375 using the new biding.

The seventh patch add myself as maintainer of this driver.

Thanks,

Gregory

Changelog:
v3 -> v4:

 - No more use a global variable to store the data related to the usb
cluster and put them in the platform data instead.

 - Add more check on the NULL pointer in the driver to make it more
 robust.

 - Add a new patch to dd myself as maintainer of this driver.

v2 -> v3:

 - Added Kishon acked-by on the 5th patch.

 - Used include/dt-bindings/phy/phy.h instead of creating a new one in
   the forth patch.

v1 -> v2:

- Add a patch fixing the use of PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO.

- Add the patch adding the DT binding documentation for Marvell MVEBU
SATA phy from Andrew Lunn

- Move the DT binding documentation of the Armada 375 USB cluster into
  the phy-mvebu.txt file.

- Made the armada375_usb_phy_xlate more robust" if there is a phy_put
  and then a phy_get".
