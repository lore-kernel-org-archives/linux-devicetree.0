Good.

On a more serious note, looking at a dts file for working
hardware is useful _but_ it is not clear how a kernel should
be configured to fully utilize that dts file. Without a
defconfig a user may need to resort to several searches like
this:

   find <kernel_src> -name '*.c' -exec grep "atmel,at91sam9x5-rtc" {} \; -print

which is non-obvious to the novice. After a line like
that, the Makefile in that directory may need to be checked
to find out which CONFIG_ option needs to be set to get
the associated driver built in (or a module?). So is there
a policy _not_ to place "compat" strings in Kconfig files
where they might be searchable?

The "bindings" documentation and DT incantations are all
for nought if the associated driver is not configured.
Looking at the dmesg output is futile.
