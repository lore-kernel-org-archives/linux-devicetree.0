This is almost what I suggested, except for ignoring r1.  More on this 
below.

I think that, for the moment, it is best if the bootloader on already 
existing subarchitectures where DT is introduced still preserve the 
already existing ability to boot using ATAGs.  This allows for the 
testing and validation of the DT concept against the legacy ATAG method 
more easily.

On new subarchitectures, it might make sense to go with DT from the 
start instead of creating setup code for every single machine.  In that 
case the bootloader for those machines would only need to care about DT 
and forget about ATAGs.

Those last two are IMHO the biggest reasons for not having both ATAGs 
and DT at the same time.  Otherwise the confusion about which one is 
authoritative, which one has precedence over the other, and/or whether 
the information should be obtained from one structure if it is missing 
from the other will simply bite us eventually for sure, as bootloader 
writers will get sloppy/lazy and have it wrong.  I strongly suggest that 
we should specify that the kernel must consider either ATAGs _or_ a 
device tree, and that the bootloader must pass only one of them.

[ I also insist on the ability for the DT info to be extractable and 
  updatable at the bootloader level, and not hardcoded into the
  bootloader itself. But that's another topic for discussion. ]

My suggestion is to have the DT support to be considered just as another 
machine _within_ each subarchitecture.  This means that a machine ID 
could be registered for DT on PXA, another for DT on OMAP, another for 
DT on Dove, etc.  This way, the DT support can be developed in parallel 
to the existing machine support code.  So if for example you want to 
test DT for Kirkwood then you may boot the kernel passing the ID for DT 
on Kirkwood into r1 and provide the DT corresponding to, say, a 
SheevaPlug.  Or you may decide to boot the same kernel binary and use 
the legacy SheevaPlug machine ID instead.  In theory both methods should 
be equivalent, baring any bugs.

Why one DT machine ID per subarchitecture?  Simply because a significant 
part of the DT handling code will have to be subarchitecture specific 
anyway.  The timer hardware, the GPIO configuration and muxing, SOC 
specific platform data handling, power management config, and many other 
things are simply too different from one SOC family to another and 
trying to have a single global DT support code to rule them all is 
insane.  At least with the concept of a "virtual" machine definition for 
DT per subarchitecture, the problem can easily be split and just fits 
naturally into the existing model on ARM.

This means that, over time, the machine ID registration would simply 
transition from a per machine thing to a per subarchitecture / SOC 
family thing.  And once the DT support is introduced for a given SOC 
family, then new machines using that SOC should be able to reuse 
the existing kernel binary for that SOC simply by providing a new DT 
data for the existing kernel to consume.

[ There is also the issue of being able to support multiple SOC families 
  within the same kernel binary, but that's something that could be done 
  with or without the device tree, and has issues of its own that the DT 
  cannot solve. Hence this is orthogonal to DT and a topic for yet another
  discussion. ]
