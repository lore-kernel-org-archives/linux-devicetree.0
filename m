Use the board manufacturer symbol instead.

If needed, add an entry for the vendor at
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/vendor-prefixes.txt

We prefer to use a compatible panel entry instead of keeping the panel
timings inside the dts.

 memory@10000000 otherwise warnings are seen when building with W=1.

Make sure that building the dtb with W=1 introduces no warnings.

Please use an IRQ flag.
