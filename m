Thanks, arnd.

For chipidea generic glue layer case, if there are three devices who use this
driver, and all devices have 32-bit bus, some devices have less 32 address lines.
For example:

- the device_a doesn't need to use dma_mask
- the device_b needs dma_mask as 0xfffffffff
- the device_c needs dma_mask as 0xfffffff0, assume it has only 28 address lines

My questions are:
- Can we not set dma_mask at driver, and only set dma-ranges at dts for device_b
and device_c as a solution to cover this different dma mask use case?

- If we can't use this solution, would you suggest one?

- If we can use this solution, for device_b and device_c, how can we write dma-ranges?
I can't find any arm platforms use it, only some powerpc platform use it.
According to the definition from Power_ePAPR_APPROVED_v1.1.pdf, it is
dma-ranges = <child-bus-address, parent-bus-address, length>
but I find the powerpc has different way for using dma-ranges.
