We could handle this by routing clocks and regulators to every sub
node. A device with a shared GPIO (or any resource without
refcounting) would be a problem. Perhaps this is good enough. This
seemed to be the conclusion on earlier discussions[1].

Primarily, I just want to see the whole chip considered and thought
around any complications from shared resources. We can't just do the
easy part now and ignore the hard parts that cause changes later.

I'm not sure how we would handle a shared reset line. Perhaps the
first one to claim it wins control.

It does have the advantage of having the full chip described in one
place, but there are some issues.

What driver would handle this and instantiate the sub devices? An MFD driver?

If we place all the child nodes under their respective hosts and had a
chip/module level node separately, we would then potentially have
probe ordering issues (probably solvable though).

This should be something generic like "mmc-parent".

This is a departure from how the wifi part is currently done. We could
take the stance that since there are no dts files actually using the
binding, we can change it breaking compatibility (if not upstream it
doesn't exist). Or we need to maintain both. Other combo chips such as
TI have the WiFi portion under SDIO host node.

The other issue potentially is does the SDIO host need to be able to
find the children easily. I think the power on the chip first so the
SDIO host can detect it issue is one example. We also have no way to
define which SDIO function this is. Putting the reg property here
would not make sense. So perhaps the phandle needs to go the other way
around having an mmc sub-node point to here.

So I think we need to keep the SDIO child node.

This should also be a generic name such as "uart". This needs to be
settled at wider scope of how we describe UART slave devices. It seems
to be a popular topic recently with yet another posting in the last
few days[2].

Thinking about different potential options now for a few hours, I
think we should just continue with having separate nodes for each
function under the respective host interface. The complicated cases
may just have to be solved with code rather than DT bindings.
