This paragraph belongs into the 2nd patch, right?

interrupts are usually unsigned values. Hmm, I see that it simplifies a
bit here, as the function to determine the irq returns the actual value
or a negative error. As there would be problems anyhow for irq values >
INT_MAX probably this comment isn't that important.

Is this locking update worth a separate change?
