We're now talking theoreticals. In the case you're working on
(ACPI+FDT), the FDT is generated by Grub or the EFI stub as an
intermediary format, and there isn't currently any code in your boot
path that modifies the FDT. You're arguing for a future situation
where the kernel makes a fixup that is not wanted in the second
kernel. I'm arguing that 1) I want to /know/ when that happens because
there are very few situations where it is a valid thing to do, and 2)
the likelyhood of that happening in the FDT+ACPI case is somewhere
between slim and none because you're working with an intermediary FDT,
not a real hardware description.

/If/ it ever becomes a problem we can revisit, until then I still
prefer the checksum method.
