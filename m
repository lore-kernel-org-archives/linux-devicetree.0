I've recently read Grant Likely's blog entry about armv8 servers:

I usually avoid to talk about embedded systems as something different 
(e.g. than servers). I think such differentations don't make much sense 
anymore in times where people are getting in need of an administrator 
for their phones. ;)

The problem I see is that if ARM requires UEFI and ACPI for general 
purpose ARMv8 servers, SOC vendors and the kernel will have to support 
that (I make the maybe silly assumption every ARMv8 SOC vendor wants to 
play in the server market). That means the kernel has to support it too.

And nobody likes to support two types of something. So there is a 
requirement (on paper) for UEFI and ACPI (both likely closed blobs), but 
none for the open stuff. And when I now start to think about paper 
loving vogons, I don't need much imagination which type will be 
streamlined away.
