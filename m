I'm getting more picky about the subject and splitting bindings to a
separate patch, but generally only when I have other comments. And
I've had to get some maintainers to stop combining commits as they
apply them.

Maybe get_maintainers.pl could spit out the desired prefix and
checkpatch check it. Evidently, running "git log --oneline" is too
hard.

I review everything that gets sent to the DT list unless maintainers
apply it first. I'll still comment afterwards if there's anything
significant (or I missed that it was applied :)).
