Well, that's effectively what my "ordered probing" series did (and
indeed didn't have this problem and parents were made sure to have
probed before their children), but if we want to have dependency
information before the probe starts, then we cannot reuse the
implementation of the DT bindings that we already have in the resource
getters as this series do.
