I agree.  However the code that Lorenzo just posted can't be deprived 
of any more sysreg/config parts.  They are simply nonexistent.

Even the larger code you reviewed before is completely useless without 
_additional_ drivers to go on top which are indeed waiting after this 
code to be merged before they are submitted to their respective 
subsystems.

And those additional drivers are way more interesting than this dumb 
register access arbitrator.  Because this is fundamentally the only 
thing it does.

Does mfd still stand for "Multi Function Device"?

Maybe the misunderstanding is about what actually is a MFD driver.
Given your persisting reluctance, I may only conclude that this is 
indeed not a MFD driver after all.

So I'll follow existing precedents in the kernel and move Lorenzo's code 
to drivers/platform/vexpress/.
