There's no mention of any buffer so it's likely plain vanilla VAD here. 
We've seen two choices to warn userspace of a acoustic event, either use 
a uevent or a kcontrol. I believe we ended-up chosing the latter on the 
Intel side in the past and that was also the plan for SOF.

In terms of configurations for the PDM we have completely different 
settings since we pass explicit coefficients while this solution passes 
qualifiers (cut-off, quality, etc), not sure if there is any point in 
trying to unify those parameters.
