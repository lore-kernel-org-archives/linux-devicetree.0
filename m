Oh, that's a good idea. I hadn't seen any SPDX tags in the tree that I
noticed before. I ended up just using the :Gpl command from neovim.

Something like `compatible = "hisilicon,hi3521a", "raysharp,rs-dm-290e";` ?

Yeah, I think I've seen that before, I don't quite grok how that works.

Are you meaning for the 0x0 index and 0x20 index clocks?

Unsure tbqf, just doing my best to translate a datasheet into code. Do
all ARM soc's have one?
