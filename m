The "ignoring RAM" messages go away...

... but the kernel still hangs.

U-Boot's built-in assumption about using addresses around 0x7f000000 to
relocate the dtb and initrd are clearly a problem here, though if that
was the only problem, the kernel would have booted further than this...

It would be nice to know what's going on here, but I'm reasonably
convinced that we're just booting the kernel in a silly way here, and
U-Boot really needs to be fixed to avoid the fixed-load-address
limitation.

I believe not, but there have been some discussions about loading to a
default "start of RAM" location if the uImage's load address/entry point
are zero, or having some header flag to indicate this.

I don't know about the implementation status of this, though.


Tixy, do you know anything about the current status of this issue in
U-Boot?  Do you have a workaround for it?
