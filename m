Thanks for the feedback, I knew I could be missing some of nasty
details like this. Looks like we need a complete implementation
of of_platform_unpopulate(). Since the are cases where the remove
order is insignificant, I'm wondering whether it still would be
useful to have a helper like device_unregister_children() which
would remove only direct children of a device ? At least this
solves my current problem.

Since the dependencies will likely never be fully described in DT
I guess we would need to create a list while actually creating
devices, to be able to walk in reverse order while destroying them.
