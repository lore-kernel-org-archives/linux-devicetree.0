Evidently there is a communication failure. Generally, the statement has
been that old DTBs should continue to work. That's even documented, as
Andre pointed out:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/ABI.txt

There are obviously shades of grey, and _rarely_ it might be necessary
to deliberately break a binding. However, that should be the rare
last-resort case, rather than a crutch for development.

Saying "bad but ok" underplays the "bad" and overplays the "ok".

I agree that it is unfortunate that we cannot provide the level of
review that we want to.

Mistakes will happen even with review; that doesn't necessitate removing
support for a binding.

I believe that in this case, Andre was complaining about this particular
breakage, unless I have misunderstood.

To be clear, I'm arguing for the strategy going forward. If no-one has
complained about the stuff broken up to this point, let's not waste time
restoring that.

Going forward we need to keep old DTBs supported.

Thanks,
Mark.
