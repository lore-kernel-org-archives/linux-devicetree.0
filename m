This is still under the internal review in Socionext,
but I attached it below FWIW.

(I am not the author of this DT.
 Written by Kunihiko Hayashi,
 and clocks/resets parts were slightly modified by me.)


Just skimming the driver, I guess it will be possible to flatten
the node structure by separating the register space into sub-areas.
If this is success, we do not the MFD driver.
