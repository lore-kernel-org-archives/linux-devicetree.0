Yes.

Or the machine driver could create the audmix device. That probably 
makes less sense, but either way there doesn't have to be a 1-1 
correspondence of DT nodes and (platform) devices.

I'm not an ASoC expert, but why can't the machine driver just control 
the audmix directly (with DAIs as separate drivers)? Is the audmix ever 
going to a be a component for a different machine driver?
