I had a closer look at how kirkwood probes its id. I mentionend kirkwood_id()
earlier but in fact it is kirkwood_pcie_id(). I assume pcie registers are shut
down with pcie clk gated? That would require to have pcie running at least at
boot-time on all boards.

While it is still possible to grab the id and power down pcie later, I still
think that using five different compatible strings is better here. Of course,
there is some effort to obtain the kirkwood SoC variant for all boards.
