It won't break because anyone who modifies r8a7790 support need to
make it specific to that SoC to not pull in r8a7791 into some
assumption. Just because the driver assumes something now doesn't mean
the hardware actually is compatible.

I think I understand your proposal with making an assumption of the
current state of the driver and making sure to add the new SoC
compatible value before adjusting the fallback. But this mainly seems
like a optimization to improve throughput commit-wise. I actually
proposed the same way for SDHI, but now when I think about it I
realize that there is no shortcut for adding the compatible string to
the driver. It has to be done sooner or later anyway.

Or what am I missing? =)
