clk-trans-latency is not a MUST property. If the datasheet don't provid=
e it or
you don't want to measure, you may not specify the property. In such ca=
se
cpufreq governor ondemand and conservative will not work, because they
can not determine the sample rate without the latency value.

No, I always get it from dt.

It's allowed.

It's ondemand/conservative governors that strongly need the latency val=
ue.
If user don't want to use it, it's fine.
