Thoughts on the patch below?

Rather than handling this at the desc level it adds an extra flag to the
irqaction which can be set/unset during suspend for those irqs we don't
want to handle. That way we don't need to tell the core about the
mismatch explicitly in DT (or ACPI/board files/whatever).

If we can request/free interrupts during suspend then there's some logic
missing, but it shows the basic idea.

I didn't have a system to hand with shared mismatched IRQF_NO_SUSPEND
interrupts, so I had to fake that up in code for testing.

Thanks,
Mark.

Subject: [PATCH] genirq: allow mixed IRQF_NO_SUSPEND requests

In some cases a physical IRQ line may be shared between devices from
which we expect interrupts during suspend (e.g. timers) and those we do
not (e.g. anything we cut the power to). Where a driver did not request
the interrupt with IRQF_NO_SUSPEND, it's unlikely that it can handle
being called during suspend, and it may bring down the system.

This patch adds logic to automatically mark the irqactions for these
potentially unsafe handlers as disabled during suspend, leaving actions
with IRQF_NO_SUSPEND enabled. If an interrupt is raised on a shared line
during suspend, only the handlers requested with IRQF_NO_SUSPEND will be
called. The handlers requested without IRQF_NO_SUSPEND will be skipped
as if they had immediately returned IRQF_NONE.
