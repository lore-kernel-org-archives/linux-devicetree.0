Hi Greg,

Actually, it's more than a random interface, a lot of SoCs and boards actually have such displays
and it's a pity to use UIO, sysfs gpio bitbanging and all sort of ugly stuff to only print a few
characters a simple and clean driver could achieve.
Some very well known SoCs even have integrated registers to lower the BOM and bypass the need for
a 74HC164 like component and avoid gpio bit banging.

My personal concern is that you could also need to drive more segments, thus 7-segments
is too restrictive.

But this driver is well structured, the gpio-bitbanging sub-driver is welcome.

Neil
