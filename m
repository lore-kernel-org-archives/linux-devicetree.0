Slightly related question.


Why don't we put clocks and resets to dwc3/core.c?

dwc3-of-simple.c only handles clocks and resets.
This is generic enough to be added to dwc3/core.c, I think.


I checked the two instances of dwc3-of-simple.

"qcom,dwc3"
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.16-rc3/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/msm8996.dtsi#L780

"rockchip,rk3399-dwc3"
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.16-rc3/arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip/rk3399.dtsi#L395


They just contain clocks, resets, and "snps,dwc3" sub-node.


If we do that,

usb@7600000 {
        compatible = "qcom,dwc3";
        clocks = ...;

        dwc3@7600000 {
                compatible = "snps,dwc3";
                reg = ...;
                interrupts = ...;
                phys = ...;
        }
};


will be turned into


dwc3@7600000 {
        compatible = "qcom,dwc3", "snps,dwc3";
        reg = ...;
        clocks = ...;
        interrupts = ...;
        phys = ...;
};


This looks simpler.




Also, dwc3/core.c and dwc3-of-simple.c
duplicate runtime PM.
