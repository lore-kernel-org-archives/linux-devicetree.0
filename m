In order to have access to the System Bus (external bus),
the System Bus Controller must be set up.

The base address and the size of each bank (each chip select)
must be set to the registers of the controller.

OK, I will fix in v2.

OK, thanks.

Will fix.

Actually, I was wondering which is better to describe the relation between
the bus and the controller,  phandle or compatible string..

It is a part of the bus controller, but used for another purpose.
(i.e. partly this is syscon.  I know this is strange, but it is
what the hardware developers designed.)

Hmm, make sense.  But, I prefer to reflect the hardware structure.

The range of System Bus is <0x40000000 0x10000000>.

The register of the System Bus Controller is
<0x58c00000 0x400>  (and <0x59800000 0x2000>)


The bus and its controller is different.

Probably, I will stick to phandle in v2.
