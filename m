I agree for the split.
It was my first intention but I feared to add too many files.
So I propose to split in 6, sunxi-ss-hash.c, sunxi-ss-des.c, sunxi-ss-a=
es.c, sunxi-ss-rng.c, sunxi-ss-common.c and sunxi-ss.h
Does can I add a sunxi-ss directory in drivers/crypto ?

I will use platform_get_drvdata/platform_set_drvdata for cleaning all t=

You could do both, but the dmaengine driver is under development.
When it will be ready, I will add DMA support.
But my intention is to keep both mode, since poll mode is better than D=
MA for small request.

There are no original driver, this driver is the first for the Security=
 System.

Thanks for your review.
