Eh, device tree is all about describing hardware.  I do not understand
what is wrong with looking at hardware manual when writing dts.

The problem is even if we have the name defined that way, it has to be
matched to the name used in mc13892 driver somehow, if we want to use
name as the key to find the regulator defined in mc13892 driver as
array mc13892_regulators[].

Can you please help me understand how this can be achieved with an
example?  Taking 'mc13892__sw1' as the example, if I read your comment
before correctly, 'sw1' is the name that you are suggesting.  How this
name can be nothing driver specific?  After all, we need to find
regulator MC13892_SW1 defined in mc13892_regulators[] by matching name
'sw1' defined by binding and name 'MC13892_SW1' defined by driver
somehow, if we want to use name to bind the regulator.

I feel I might miss your point again.  So please help clarify.
