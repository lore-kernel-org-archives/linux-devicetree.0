OK

So aside from theorethical considerations it's good to look at what the
current code is doing in my opinion.

In the current patchset, acpi_dev_get_property_reference() is only used
in one place, which is acpi_get_gpiod_by_index().  That, in turn, is only
used by acpi_find_gpio() and by dev_get_named_gpiod_from_child() (and its
devm variant).  acpi_find_gpio() passes 0 as index (which means it only
cares about the first reference in the list) and the _get_named_gpiod_from_child()
thigs are used by leds-gpio and gpio-keys-polled.  Each of them also uses
0 as the index (so they only care about the first reference in the list as well).

Thus, arguably, acpi_dev_get_property_reference() in its current form is
sufficient for what we need at the moment.  There simply is no need to make
it more complicated right now and we can extend it in the future if need be.
