Presumably the node that contains the pinctrl-single,gpio-func property
is optional, but once you have such a node, pinctrl-single,gpio-func is
required?

I tend to agree.

But that tends to imply that adding support for generic pinconf into the
pinctrl-simple driver isnt' actually going to be useful for anyone. If
pinctrl-single only supports some part of your HW, how can you use it?
Or, do you intend to somehow make pinctrl-single support both the common
generic pinconf stuff, and somehow be extensible to support any
SoC-specific pin config fields?
