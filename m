Switch to use the ti,edma3-tpcc and ti,edma3-tptc binding for the eDMA3.
With the new bindings boards can customize and tweak the DMA channel
priority to match their needs. With the new binding the memcpy is safe
to be used since with the old binding it was not possible for a driver
to know which channel is allowed to be used as non HW triggered channel.
Using the new binding will allow us to reserve PaRAM slots to be used by
the DSP which was not possible before and prevented the da850 boards to be
moved to DT only.

Note that the DMA memcpy is disabled, it can be enabled by reserving
channels for memcpy by adding the following property to the edma node:
ti,edma-memcpy-channels = <20 21>; /* Reserving channel 20 and 21 for memcpy */
