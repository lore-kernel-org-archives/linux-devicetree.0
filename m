The index in the DT needs to match the index that is in the DT 
specification. This does not necessarily have to match the ASoC driver ID. 
But since it makes things easier for the driver a lot of drivers opt for 
using the same IDs as specified in the DT specification.

Is there any advantage to putting the card node inside the controller node 
rather than having it as a separate node?

Yes, if the graph is strongly connected (which it should be) the framework 
will be able to identify when all components that belong to the graph have 
been registered and is then able to create a card for it.

Are you by chance at FOSDEM? If you are maybe we can sit down for a moment 
and discuss things.
