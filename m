I understand but I dont see how to fix it properly unless we add a
some specific STM32 properties in the DT or in the dwc2_core_params.
In fact there are two cores, and they are different in terms of
functionality (despite of the type of the PHY).
One core is for FS and other is for HS, so they could/should have
different compatible strings because they have different
configurations and are different piece of IP/Hardware(The buffer size
are different, the number of end points and so one, DMA)

But the problem is that the HS core can also support the the FS mode
and in this case is misleading to have a HS core with an FS compatible
string.
Something like that (real case for STM32F429I-DISCO):

&usbotg_hs {
compatible = "st,stm32-fsotg", "snps,dwc2";
dr_mode = "host";
pinctrl-0 = <&usbotg_fs_pins_b>;
pinctrl-names = "default";
status = "okay";
};

Even if the decision is phy based it would lead to a STM32 specific
logic and we would need to figure out how to represent the internal
PHY.
