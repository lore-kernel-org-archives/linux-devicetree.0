I'm facing a problem after removing the index for MCU and MC sub-nodes.
The MCUs and MCs aren't always enabled depending on how DRAM DIMMs are
installed on the system.
I still need a way to associate the MCU with its indicator bit in the
enable mask retrieved from CSR.
For MC and MCB nodes only, can I introduce an "enable-mask" field?
For example:
"
pmucmcb@7e710000 {
        compatible = "apm,xgene-pmu-mcb";
        reg = <0x0 0x7e710000 0x0 0x1000>;
        enable-mask = <0x00000001>;
};

pmucmcb@7e730000 {
        compatible = "apm,xgene-pmu-mcb";
        reg = <0x0 0x7e730000 0x0 0x1000>;
        enable-mask = <0x00000002>;
};
"
Or can you please give a suggestion how I can fix it?

Thanks,
