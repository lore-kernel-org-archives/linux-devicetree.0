OK. Since this is an implementation detail with no effect on DT ABI,
it would be easy to change later if it did turn out to be an issue.

Yes, all of the barrier implementations boil down to one of:

#define isb(x) __asm__ __volatile__ ("mcr p15, 0, %0, c7, c5, 4" \
                                    : : "r" (0) : "memory")
#define dsb(x) __asm__ __volatile__ ("mcr p15, 0, %0, c7, c10, 4" \
                                    : : "r" (0) : "memory")
#define dmb(x) __asm__ __volatile__ ("mcr p15, 0, %0, c7, c10, 5" \
                                    : : "r" (0) : "memory")

The final :"memory" tells the compiler that the __asm__ statement may
change memory, so the compiler isn't allowed to "cache" anything over
the statement.
