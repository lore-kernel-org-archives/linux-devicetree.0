I still would really rather have the flexibility to just put the nodes
anywhere.

However, I don't think we lose any functionality by forcing the nodes
to be inside the pin controller's node. And as you say, we do get to
remove the phandle from the mux and config properties then too, which
very marginally simplifies parsing.

One other concern I had was a device that needed to configure the pin
mux on two different pin controllers (think the main SoC and some complex
chip attached to one of the SoC's external busses). Ideally, there'd be
a Linux device for each end of the bus, and each would configure the
respective chip's pinmux. However, I can certainly foresee cases where
there's only a Linux device for the main SoC, and it'd need to configure
both chips' pinmux. Still, I think we can deal with that easily enough,
since that device's pinctrl property can simply use the 1:n feature, and
have multiple entries pointing at both chip's pinctrl device:

foo@c8000200 {
   ...
   pinctrl = <&pinmux_soc_xxx> <&pinmux_otherchip_xxx>
             <&pinmux_soc_xxx_suspend> <&pinmux_otherchip_xxx_suspend>;
   pinctrl-entries = <2 2>;
   pinctrl-names = "active", "suspend";
};

So, I can live with requiring the pin configuration nodes to be underneath
the relevant pin controller's node, and removing the phandle from the
mux and config properties in the pin configuration nodes.
