Yes. Or even more generically we could have a device_get_irq() function:

int device_get_irq(struct device *dev, unsigned int num)
{
	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_OF) && dev->of_node)
		return irq_of_parse_and_map(dev->of_node, num);
	/* An ACPI hook could go here */
	return 0
}

It would be callable by any device driver, and platform_get_irq() could
call it too.
