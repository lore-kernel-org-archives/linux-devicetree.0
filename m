If there's no shared legacy feature set, then it's probably less
useful to have a shared less precise compatible value.

What the main point I was trying to get across was that we shouldn't
expand the generic binding with per-vendor compatible fields, instead
we should have those as extensions on the side.

I'm also a little apprehensive of using "legacy", it goes in the same
bucket as "misc". At some point 1.0 will be legacy too, etc.
