No. EP can configure its own DMA engine via config bar, same as RC.
There could be a dependency on RC in terms of which memory region
the EP is allowed to DMA to but I think that is outside the scope of this
driver.

The config bar is setup by host controller driver. For e.g you can see
cfg reg in pcie@1f2b0000 node in arch/arm64/boot/dts/apm/apm-storm.dtsi.
The dmaengine driver is simply going to read this reg to know the config base
and access its own registers accordingly.  In this patch config base
register is present in each node.
For e.g for port0 it is 0x1f2b0154.
