I needed this as a parameter for the of_platform_populate() function in 
altr_edac_probe(). I will change the naming to prevent misunderstanding.

Yes, I can move the documentation - I understand better from the 5/5 
email what you are looking for.

I can change the name to ECC Manager. There are a group of consecutive 
registers to enable and disable ECC for peripherals. Unfortunately, the 
SDRAM register is in a completely different area (not grouped with these 
peripherals) and seems better suited to the Memory Controller EDAC 
instead of a device EDAC for the peripherals.

There is not a specific EDAC device. I grouped these HW blocks into 
different instances of an EDAC device to match what I though the Linux 
EDAC framework wanted.

There are 2 memory allocation functions (ocram & L2) that return a 
pointer to the data. The OCRAM allocation function returns the gen_pool 
pointer in the generic_ptr so that it can be freed later.

No problem.

Yes, my mistake.

Yes, these functions are for triggering an ECC error for testing L2 
cache reads. I need to ensure the cleared data is written to L2 cache 
because that is what I'm testing. The PL310 manual said the L2 cache was 
included in the LoC.

Our SoC is a Cortex-A9 but if there is a better way, I'm open to it.

Yes, in altr_edac_device_trig(), the memory is allocated, the ECC errors 
are injected, the data is read back causing ECC error interrupts and the 
memory is freed. Would the standard kzalloc() and kfree() be betteer?
