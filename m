fsl-ssi was located in powerpc/fsl/ssi.txt. This is no powerpc specific
device, so it should be moved to sound/ as it connects to differen audio
codecs.

-Freescale Synchronous Serial Interface
-
-The SSI is a serial device that communicates with audio codecs.  It can

-Required properties:

-- cell-index:       The SSI, <0> = SSI1, <1> = SSI2, and so on.
-- reg:              Offset and length of the register set for the device.

-                    field that represents an encoding of the sense and
-                    level information for the interrupt.  This should be
-                    encoded based on the information in section 2)
-                    depending on the type of interrupt controller you
-                    have.
-- interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller that
-                    services interrupts for this device.
-- fsl,mode:         The operating mode for the SSI interface.
-                    "i2s-slave" - I2S mode, SSI is clock slave

-                    If specified, the SSI is to be programmed in asynchronous
-                    mode.  In this mode, pins SRCK, STCK, SRFS, and STFS must

-                    playback and capture to use different sample sizes and
-                    sample rates.  Some drivers may require that SRCK and STCK
-                    be connected together, and SRFS and STFS be connected

-Optional properties:
-- codec-handle:     Phandle to a 'codec' node that defines an audio
-                    codec connected to this SSI.  This node is typically

-
-Child 'codec' node required properties:
-- compatible:       Compatible list, contains the name of the codec
-
-Child 'codec' node optional properties:
-- clock-frequency:  The frequency of the input clock, which typically comes
-                    from an on-board dedicated oscillator.
-
-Notes on fsl,playback-dma and fsl,capture-dma:
-
-On SOCs that have an SSI, specific DMA channels are hard-wired for playback
-and capture.  On the MPC8610, for example, SSI1 must use DMA channel 0 for
-playback and DMA channel 1 for capture.  SSI2 must use DMA channel 2 for
-playback and DMA channel 3 for capture.  The developer can choose which
-DMA controller to use, but the channels themselves are hard-wired.  The
-purpose of these two properties is to represent this hardware design.
-
-The device tree nodes for the DMA channels that are referenced by
-"fsl,playback-dma" and "fsl,capture-dma" must be marked as compatible with
-"fsl,ssi-dma-channel".  The SOC-specific compatible string (e.g.
-"fsl,mpc8610-dma-channel") can remain.  If these nodes are left as
-"fsl,elo-dma-channel" or "fsl,eloplus-dma-channel", then the generic Elo DMA
-drivers (fsldma) will attempt to use them, and it will conflict with the
-sound drivers.
