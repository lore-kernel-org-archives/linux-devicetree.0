  - Split binding changes from original commit
  - Updated binding info as per Rob's suggestion
  - Dropped PATCH 4/4, as discussed during review
  - Dropped PATCH 3/4, as it is independent RTC code change,
    so will submit it separately to ease merging.
  - Fixed all other minor comments

Attempt has been made to push some of the patches to the list sometime
back in 2013.
