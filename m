Thanks for your comments. I think I will try to contact authors of
unclear drivers once we get requirements described a bit better.
Hopefully at least some of them will respond.

OK, if others agree, I'm fine with leaving MODULE_LICENSE as is.

Thanks, I'll prepare & send patch updating SubmittingDrivers and maybe
some related files (if needed).

However there are some questions I need to ask first:


1) Can we add COPYING-BSD-2-CLAUSE (or similar)?

We already have GPL drivers with headers like:
a) "Licensed under the GNU/GPL. See COPYING for details."
b) "This driver is released to the public under the terms of the GNU
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 2"

Adding a similar file (e.g. COPYING-BSD-2-CLAUSE) would allow BSD
drivers to reference it as well, e.g.:
"Licensed under the BSD 2-clause. See COPYING-BSD-2-CLAUSE for details.=
"
or similar.
As described earlier, there are some drivers /mentioning/ usage of BSD
license (in a header or with MODULE_LICENSE) without providing its
text at all.


2) How about sharing BSD 3-clause license?

Does it make sense to add anything like COPYING-BSD-3-CLAUSE? Should
we leave <organization> in license text in such file? Or should we
replace it with "author" as some drivers do? How drivers could
reference such file? Would a simple
"Licensed under the BSD 3-clause. See COPYING-BSD-3-CLAUSE for details.=
"
be enough? Or should it be more specific like "With <organization>
being Foo Company"?

Or maybe we shouldn't add anything like COPYING-BSD-3-CLAUSE at all
and just require all drivers to attach whole text of BSD 3-clause
license in a header?

The same questions apply to Clear BSD license which also has
<organization> in its text.
