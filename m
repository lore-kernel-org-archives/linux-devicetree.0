Agreed on the compatible string. It's putting Linux specifics into DT.

You could flip this around and have the module make a call into the
kernel to determine whether to initialize or not. Then platforms could
set a flag to indicate this.

What does cpufreq core do if multiple drivers are registered? Perhaps a
ranking is needed and this would only get enabled if there are no other
drivers and other conditions like having the clock "cpu" present are met.
