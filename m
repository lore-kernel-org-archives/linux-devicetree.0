If you can come up with something more descriptive that would be good.
Certain features or capabilities for example. If not, I guess this is
okay. I worry that the numbering could be different in a future part,
but the IP otherwise unchanged. Then you would not be able to use
these compatible strings.

Okay.

The start is common bindings. :)
