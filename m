Do you ever have different devices with the same address? That would
be somewhat problematic as really these should be
"touchscreen@<addr>".

Yeah, not a fan of these properties at first glance. Why can't you
just fail probe on the non-existent devices?

BTW, I've been meaning to ask you if you are looking at the Android
side of things as well?

Which is fine IMO, though I do think we should look at those cases
carefully to ensure they stay the exception.

That would work. Board and chip versions both need better handling in
kernel IMO.

QCom has a whole scheme around version numbering in compatible
strings. (Unfortunately, bootloaders only support their previous way
of doing things.)

Agreed.
