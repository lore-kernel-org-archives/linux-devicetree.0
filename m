I agree. Will's later patch will do this by describing the relationship
between interrupts and CPUs explciitly:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-January/319899.html

I completely agree with this, which is why I'm opposed to relyiong on
the order Linux probes CPUs (as this has no guaranteed relationship with
the DTB).

While relying on the order of CPU nodes is not something I want to do,
it's at least contained within the DTB and has some chance of
functioning when Linux aribtrarily renumbers CPUs.

Does that make sense?

Thanks,
Mark.
