Hmm... do you have 4 total rev-id nodes on apq8074? I only see
one rev-id node per pmic (2 total), so I'm a little lost how the
correct pmic version is detected on the 0-01 and 0-05 devices in
your example above. Maybe I've missed something though, I'll have
to check in a few hours when I'm in the office.
