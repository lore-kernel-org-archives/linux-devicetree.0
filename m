Hey Punnaiah-

Was this intended to be sent out with a driver?

Does your example below then describe only a single channel?  Or, should
I expect to see sub-nodes representing each of the dma channels?

I would have expected, as a dma controller, to see a #dma-cells here,
and a tie-in to the existing Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt documentation.
