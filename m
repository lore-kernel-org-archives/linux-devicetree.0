Topsort by bus wouldn't work. That would imply that nothing uses 
something involved with another bus. And early devices are handled fine 
by normal dependencies too (as long as they are complete), so there is 
no need to make an distinction.

That's why I've invented those "well-done"-initcalls. These are 
initcalls which just register a driver and don't probe it. Thats 
necessary to build a catalog of existing in-kernel-drivers (you have to 
know what you are sorting). Fortunately most drivers are already of that 
type. And those which aren't can be either just used like before (if it 
works) or they can be changed.

Changing them can be done per board (only enable dependency based order 
for a board if necessary drivers have changed).
