Not very much?

Turns out I was relying on these to get kzalloc() defined but there are 
better headers for me to use for that!

No (this is already gone in v2).

I'll fix this.

This clock cannot change its own rate. It is very nearly a fixed factor 
clock but with the additional quirk that the "fixed" factor changes 
depending upon the rate of the parent clock.

This is the same implementation as clk-fixed-factor. I concluded that it 
returns success because round rate should always result in the set rate 
for this clock being a nop.

Makes sense...

You want a patch for clk-fixed-factor too?

Tough question.

The absence of this flag appears grants arch code permission to use 
secret backdoors to do "weird stuff" but making special assumptions 
about the type of the clock. This clock keeps its implementation private 
so noone outside the compilation unit can usefully cast it.

However, it also looks like only omap2 is the only platform that makes 
these special assumptions so when this code is run on STM32 there is 
nothing to actually consume the CLK_IS_BASIC flag at runtime.

In other words the flag is useless but, I think, also correctly applied.

I'd be happy to remove it if anyone disagrees with the guesswork above.

Alternatively, I could write a patch to *invert* CLK_IS_BASIC and rename 
it CLK_CASTABLE on the grounds that only the people doing "weird stuff" 
should have to care about this flag at all. Any interest in that?

Thanks. I'll fix this.
