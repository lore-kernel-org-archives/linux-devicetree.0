Indeed, it is 0xfa. I chose 0xf8 because at24 driver will truncate the
eeprom size at something that is power of 2 (I don't know the reason behind
this, maybe it is something historical, maybe it is something I don't get
it for the moment). If I would use 24mac402 (which EEPROM size should be
6 bytes but due to the truncation it will become of 4 bytes) and 0xfa as
starting offset I could read only 4 octets. Due to this I chose to use
24mac602 which length is 8 = 2^3 bytes, the reading will start from 0xf8
but the first 2 bytes will not be of interest.
Sorry that I forgot to mention this in the cover letter.

Yes, I will remove this part form in the 3rd version.
