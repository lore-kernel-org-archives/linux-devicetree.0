The Firmware and the hardware design. Both bridges, with stock firmware,
are fully capable of providig EDID information and handling interrupts.
But on this specific design, with this specific firmware, I need to read
EDID from one bridge, and handle interrupts on the other. Back when I
was starting the development I could not come up with a proper way to
split EDID and interrupts between two bridges in a way that would result
in a fully functional connector. Did I miss something?
