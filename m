The regulator(s) are already handled by the vmmc and vqmcc regulators
of the mmc controller binding.

If more regulators are needed, we can easily extend mmc-pwrseq-simple
to support them, or define a whole new powerseq driver.

Not involving the real driver is by design really, the real driver
cannot bind / have its probe function called until its sdio interface
has been probed which is where the pwrseq driver comes in.

This also allows re-using existing sdio drivers without needing
them to be aware of certain board perculiarities

If a special power on (or suspend) order is nescessary a custom
pwrseq driver can be created for this, even one which is meant
to work in tandem with a specific sdio device driver. The idea
is that the device driver will ask the mmc core to powerdown the
device for powersaving in certain cases (e.g. suspend) and then
the mmc core will call into the powerseq driver.

Granted there may be more complex scenarios where thighter control
over the resources is needed, but for now this seems to work really
well and it is much better then the deadlock we had before were
all solutions were shot down as not flexible enough.

Thanks.
