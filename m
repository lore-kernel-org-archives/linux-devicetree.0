You are mixing the hardware messaging based mailbox and the software
"smc/hvc" based mailbox together here. Please keep them separated.
IIUC smc/hvc based mailcox is used for "tx" or too keep it simple in
one direction and hardware based is used for "rx" or the other direction
for communication.

You *should not* mix them as single unit. Also lots of other vendor need
SMC/HVC based mailbox. So make it generic and keep it separate.
