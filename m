This patch set introduces support for MSI(-X) in GICv2m specification,
which is implemented in some variation of GIC400.

This depends on and has been tested with the following patch set which
implements PCI supports for ARM64:
 
    * https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/8/12/394
    * https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/8/12/361

Changes in V6:
    * Fix the logic in patch 1 in drivers/irqchip/irq-gic.c: gic_of_init()
      to print warning message when gicv2m_of_init fails instead of
      returning error since v2m is optional.

    * Minor clean up

Changes in V5:
    * Rebase to git://git.infradead.org/users/jcooper/linux.git irqchip/core

  Marc Zyngier suggestions:
    * Only use GICv2m irq_chip for MSI interrupts.
    * Simplify logic to support multi-MSI in arch/arm64/kernel/msi.c.
    * Modify gicv2m_setup_msi_irq() to also handle multi-MSI.

  Mark Rutlan suggestions: 
    * V4 patch set did not support multiple MSI register frame within a GIC.
      Although, the proposed GICv2m device tree binding should be able to
      handle the case.  Mark was questioning on how we can properly handle
      this in the code. Therefore, I try to implement this by iterating through
      the subnodes and look for msi-controller property. Once found, the code
      parses v2m register frame information and store it in the v2m_list of
      each gic_chip_data.

  Jingoo han suggestions:
    * Misc clean up.
