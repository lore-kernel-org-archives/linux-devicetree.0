As of the current code, it fails the PLL frequency initialization and
bails out. Thinking about it more, it actually makes more sense to just
warn and still go ahead to register the clock, in which case it will use
whatever default frequency after chip power on reset or a frequency
configured in the bootloader.

Okay I get your point that the order of device nodes may not be relied
on for device initialization order. But then another mechanism should be
deployed to give developers the option to decide on the clock
initialization sequence. It can be optional but it should be there.

Okay, what we need here is to initialize the PLL to a desired frequency,
based on device tree settings (since it will be configured differently,
among different boards). This is a PLL that 1) has limited options of
frequencies which it can be configured to, and 2) has multiple child
clocks, where is a more suitable place to initialize it to the desired
frequency than right before registering it to the framework? I know a
lot of people do it in the bootloader, but I thought we should be given
the flexibility of configuring it in the kernel.

When you say "consumers", do you mean 1) the device driver that uses the
PLL; or 2) the device driver that use the child clock of the PLL? If
it's case 1), then we don't really have a device driver that directly
uses the PLL, and I thought that's quite normal, as most PLLs don't
directly feed into any peripherals.

We do have multiple device drivers that use the child clocks of the PLL,
but it makes no sense to configure the PLL clock in any of those drivers.
