Not really.

I meant to say that you may need to change the existing APIs to the 
devm_* APIs.

This was used with TI's USB 2.0 PHY, that has ULPI interface.

In a way this is also a USB 2.0 phy, isn't it ?

The lookup created in this ulpi_phy.h was used to help getting the PHY 
in the
driver for parent device (a core wrapper) of the controller (platform 
glue layer) that requests this PHY.
I am not certain at this point about how PHY has to be handled in case 
of Chipidea.
Was just throwing in ideas. :-)


Thanks
