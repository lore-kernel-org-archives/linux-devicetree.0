Yes, That's possible if the data provider use the "read-only" generic 
binding like MTD partitions which the eeprom framwork could use to set 
the binary file mode appropriately.

"read-only" property seems to be more generic for all types of data 
providers.

I will give it a try and document this in the bindings too in next version.
