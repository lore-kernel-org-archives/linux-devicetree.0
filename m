Rob, DT maintainers,

I'd like a feedback from DT maintainers on this 'range' topic.

TISCI Firmware [1] currently seems to define a type corresponding to a
device ID[2]. in AM6 device, for example, this is different, however
have a 1 to 1 correspondence. However, there is expectation that type will
end up as device ID in a future SoC.

While this is subject to much debate internally, I'd like some feedback if this
is OK from Device tree representation - it is true that Firmware does
look at it as type, however in some future SoC, it could be that the
values themselves may correspond one to one with a device id -> The
original wish was that types might be something reusable across SoCs,
but that is turning out to be more of a theoretical wish than any thing
practical.
