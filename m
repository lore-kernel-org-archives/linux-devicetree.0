That's right.

IP101GR from what I can see on the board.

Agreed, chances are high it'll be this way.

you mean with reg = <3> ?

I'm not too sure about these last 2 points. As you mentioned, we are
only speculating regarding the p201. I would prefer to avoid putting
things we are not sure about in the DT (as much as possible).

We could disable the ethernet for p201:
1) if nobody complains, situation remains unchanged, ethernet is not
working on that board
2) if someone complains, then we will be able to some facts from
him/her, and get it working properly.

After all, that's not a regression. With what we had in the meson-gxbb-
p20x.dtsi so far, ethernet never worked on that board.
