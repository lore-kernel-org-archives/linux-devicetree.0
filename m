The value of a timeval is the sum of its fields, but the field tv_usec
must always be non-negative.  The tv_sec field can be negative.  So,
your application simply needs to do this:

	if (tx.time.tv_usec < 0) {
		tx.time.tv_sec  -= 1;
		tx.time.tv_usec += 1000000000;
	}

Still makes no sense.  Why should the interrupt rate depend on the
clock frequency?

If the ISR is delivering batches of time stamps, then the interrupt
rate aught to be the highest rate that the system can support.

Didn't help me too much :(

You said:

   one user space process would have to read timestamps for all
   channels/clients and then leave it up to user space IPC to get them
   to other processes, which isn't great.

I disagree.  I think having tons of fifos isn't great.

Ideally, there will be kernel consumers for most of the channels, and
they will forward the time stamps in a way appropriate to their
subsystem.  For example, network devices will use so_timestamping. 
Any "leftover" channels can go through the generic PTP interface.


Thanks,
Richard
