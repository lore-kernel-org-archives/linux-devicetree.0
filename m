the filter_fn is only used in legacy boot case not in DT boot.

It was failing because you were using wrong dt bindings for the eDMA, if you
update that it will work.

It is to have more time for the DMA to write, read the audio data as McBSP
does not have FIFO.
This is a SW parameter, so it does not belong to the DT if we take things by
the letter. Probably it is better to leave it out for now and add it later =
if
there is a need?

Yeah, this is not working on OMAP-McBSP either.

With exact bclk the I2S is working fine, with most codecs at least we are
using that with OMAPs.

The filter_fn is for the legacy boot, DT does not use filter, it looks up t=
he
channel.
The reason for the failure in your case was that the dma bindings in mcbsps
were not correct, if you update them they will work.

Not just shorter, but the -audio postfix is just stupid. IMHO.
