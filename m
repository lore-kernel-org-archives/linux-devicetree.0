Right, I realized that later.

It would be nice to have a way to do it without a platform specific
notifier, I just haven't found a nice way to express that in DT.

I wasn't referring to the error path here, sorry for being
ambiguous. What I meant that we could add code after this line
to look for an IOMMU.

Right. Maybe the best solution for that code path however is to
make it the same as the of_platform code where we today set the
mask pointer to &dev->coherent_mask.

Doesn't that already get handled correctly by of_bus_pci_translate()?
We have bus specific translation functions that should work for
both 'ranges' and 'dma-ranges'.
