I think that it makes the bindings more self-documenting. Not all PLLs have
all of possible types of output clocks, so the presence or absence of a
child node indicates if a PLL actually has that output or not.

It is also complicated by the fact that one of the child nodes (sysclk)
is  already an array of clocks.

To do what you are suggesting might look something like this...

---

Required properties:
- compatible: shall be one of:
	- "ti,da850-pll0" for PLL0 on DA850/OMAP-L138/AM18XX
	- "ti,da850-pll1" for PLL1 on DA850/OMAP-L138/AM18XX
- reg: physical base address and size of the controller's register area.
- clocks: phandles corresponding to the clock names
- clock-names: names of the clock sources - depends on compatible string
	- for "ti,da850-pll0", shall be "clksrc", "extclksrc"
	- for "ti,da850-pll1", shall be "clksrc"
- #clock-cells: shall be set to <2>.

Consumers:

The clock cell values for consumers work as follows...

The first index is one of the constants defined in ti-davinci-pll.h

The second index is 0 unless the first index is TI_DAVINCI_SYSCLK. In the case
of TI_DAVINCI_SYSCLK the second index the SYSCLK domain ID (n in SYSCLKn).

For compatible = "ti,da850-pll0":
	- <&pll0 TI_DAVINCI_PLLOUT 0> is the PLLOUT clock
	- <&pll0 TI_DAVINCI_SYSCLK n> is one of the SYSCLKn clock domains where n is 1 to 7
	- <&pll0 TI_DAVINCI_AUXCLK 0> is the AUXCLK clock domain
	- <&pll0 TI_DAVINCI_OBSCLK 0> is the OBSCLK clock domain
	- all other index combinations are invalid

For compatible = "ti,da850-pll1":
	- <&pll0 TI_DAVINCI_SYSCLK n> is one of the SYSCLKn clock domains where n is 1 to 3
	- <&pll0 TI_DAVINCI_OBSCLK 0> is the OBSCLK clock domain
	- all other index combinations are invalid

I guess it is not too bad (writing a clock lookup function that knows
all of these rules could get interesting though).
