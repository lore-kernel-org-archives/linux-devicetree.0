The V2 of the series updates a minor comment in binding and picks up Rob's Reviewed-by

Since I have'nt seen additional comments, I am assuming things are fine for v4.19.

The following series enables support for Secure Proxy in newest addition in TI's SoC
portfolio - AM654 SoC (posted previously as RFC).

The series is based on v4.18-rc1 and is available here:
https://github.com/nmenon/linux-2.6-playground/commits/upstream/v4.18-rc1/k3-1-am6-sproxy

There are a couple of follow on patches to be posted as well (Kconfig changes
for K3_ARCH and actual dts node changes).

Changes since RFC are highlighted in each of the patches, but overall:
* The K3 dependency has been broken out into a seperate series independent of
  this.
* Binding has been seperated out as it's own file (even though the driver is
  reused).

Consolidated all patches (including all series) are available here:
https://github.com/nmenon/linux-2.6-playground/commits/upstream/v4.18-rc1/k3-am6-integ

Full Boot log  on AM654 (integrated with all patch series) is available here:
