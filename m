But the node in question is just the bus part of the SoC. Things like
cpus are not included.

Can't argue with that...

It is supposed to be a bus, not just a container. However, we probably
don't generally fully and accurately model the buses in SoCs so DT
ends up being just a container frequently. If the bus is more than
simple-bus, then it should have some resource that needs to be
controlled to enable the bus.

I'm not sure Realview and Integrator are models to follow. They are a
bit unique in their h/w design.

The SoC bus API.

Yes, but the information exported has nothing really to do with a bus.
The "bus" part of it is more sub-classing platform_bus_type for all
platform devices on an SOC. That container may or may not directly
correspond to the bus structure of the SOC as defined in DT. I guess
it is the mixing of really 2 independent things that I don't like and
has made its use sparse. We should perhaps mandate using the bus (for
what I described) and make the information part separate and be able
to populate it from any driver (e.g. an SoC syscon driver which reads
the SOC revision).
