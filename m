Ok, sorry, we are running around in circles here, basically you moved
the node to cpus according to reviews. I still think that treating cpus
as a device is not a great idea, even though I am in the same
position with C-states and probably will add C-state tables in the cpus
node.

I just would like to see under cpus nodes and properties that apply to
all ARM systems, and avoid defining properties (eg interrupts) that
have different meanings for different ARM cores.

The question related to why the kernel should create a platform device
out of cpus is still open. I really do not want to block your series
for these simple issues but we have to make a decision and stick to that,
I am fine either way if we have a plan.

Yes, but if a core supporting big.LITTLE requires the same concept you
need here we have to cater for that because after all cpus is a node that
exists on ALL ARM systems, we should not rush and find a solution du
jour without thinking about all foreseeable use cases.

Thank you,
