It is a valid option, just no-one has a use for it. Who knows what kind=
 of
crazy setup the end-users will use.

I=E2=80=99ll test it as a module to make sure.

Depends on the embedded system. On the ones I=E2=80=99m working with a =
sane bootloader
(for example u-boot) the command line is easily modified.

>=20

Do you really want to start this argument? Didn=E2=80=99t we used to ha=
ve great flamewars
about putting linux specific things in the DT?

Does enabling & disabling capes fall into =E2=80=98hardware description=
=E2=80=99?

I guess we=E2=80=99ll have to ask the DT maintainers for that.

Err, the two options are nothing alike no? One deals is defined as:

rootdelay: "Delay (in seconds) to pause before attempting to mount the =
root filesystem"

The other is the period with which to perform period firmware requests.

I can do that; that would get rid of the option too.

>=20

Yes, but that=E2=80=99s not the case here. I have in mind fixing some p=
roblems with the
firmware loader, but http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070355/quotes?item=3D=
