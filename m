Hi Arnd,

Sorry for the duplication.  Ccing others.

I see your point.  Thank you for the clarification.  I will fix this in my v2.

There is a Data-Realignment Engine (DRE) in the IP which is only available for
data width setting of 64-bits and less.  So, we use the data-width DT parameter
to verify this condition and we update alignment shift accordingly.
