Running make prepare and then re-running a build doesn't rebuild anything
for me.  However, I always build with O=  Also works if I do a make
dtbs too.  So, everything seems to work as expected here.

I think this needs a bit more debugging to see why the whole kernel is
being rebuilt - the kernel build system has methods to tell you why stuff
is being built, which would be a good place to start.
