nvmem file in the /sys/ is just a binary file. hexdump is one of the 
ways to dump the data, the user can read the binary file and interpret 
the data in the way he wants it.

I was thinking of add similar support to show cells in 
/sys/class/nvmem/*/cells/cfg0 in future once the framework is merged. 
For now I want to keep it simple. This would be binary content again. 
you can dump it using strings any program which wants to interpret it 
differently.

I think you would have two providers in that case one is ocotp and other 
is ROM.
DT would look something like this:

/* Provider */
ocotp {
	...
	soc-id {
		reg = ...;
	};
};

rom {
	...
	soc-reg {
		reg = ...;
	};
};

/* consumer */
consumer {
	nvmem-cell  = <&soc_id>, <&soc_rev>;
	nvmem-cell-names = "soc-id", "soc-revision";
};
