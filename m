Nice description.

It's unclear to me what you mean by "0 if not used" here. The property is
required, so its description in a devicetree should always have a non-zero
value of `status = "okay";`, as 0 is an invalid value according to the
datasheet (sensibly so). If `status = "disabled";` then it doesn't really
matter, which makes the comment not terribly useful.

I'd leave off the parent clock information. Practically speaking it's probably
always going to be the APB clock, but who knows. From a devicetree writer's
perspective they just want to say "make it 7MHz" or whatever speed they,
and it shouldn't matter too much how we get there.

Finally, as mentioned on the driver patch, please send v4 without the history
at the bottom.

Cheers,

Andrew
