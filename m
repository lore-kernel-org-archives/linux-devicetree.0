Follow the bindings, I guess? I don't think we (sunxi) have dealt
with modules that have LEDs or anything that needs to be named after
the board.

On a related topic, I don't know if you (Stefan / Olimex) want to split
this into a .dtsi file for the SoM, and a .dts file for the EVB. It might
help your customers? I've tried it previously, and it helps in some ways
when you're matching the files to the schematics. But it is confusing
when you want the big picture. On the other hand, this is not going to
help with supporting different modules on the same baseboard, as the
routing, peripherals and labels likely won't match up. Just my two cents.
