(This style of commit explanation is getting quite common. I must say I
rather dislike it. I think people should just update the entire commit
explanation when needed, and not simply paste any changes at the end of
it, thereby forcing the the reader to determine which older parts are
actually overruled by newer parts. Besides, many, or maybe even most, of
the changes are really not interesting enough to keep in the commit
explanation.)

A patch that uses these exports hit lkml recently:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/28/596 .

> +EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(rpi_firmware_get);

But I didn't spot a (recent) patch that uses this export. Is it queued
somewhere?

Thanks,
