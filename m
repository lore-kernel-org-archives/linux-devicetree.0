Yes. omap-usb2 is *only* dt supported (New drivers shouldn't have the
old non-dt support).
Some patches are queued only for 3.7.

In case you want to use MUSB please use these patches on linux-next..
[PATCH v2] arm: omap: hwmod: make *phy_48m* as the main_clk of ocp2scp
[PATCH] ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod data: Fix ocp2scp_usb_phy and usb_host_hs
entries (from Benoit)
[PATCH 0/2] ARM: dts: Add subnode for ocp2scp (patch series)
[PATCH v3 0/3] ARM: dts: omap: add dt data for MUSB (patch series)

Pls note all these patches are queued for 3.7

Thanks
Kishon
