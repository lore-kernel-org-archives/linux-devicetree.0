Not sure what is the real use-case here, But this is how it is supposed 
to work.

cellinfo in nvmem_config is used to pass cell information in non-dt 
style to the core. The core would parse it and convert into nvmem-cells. 
Am not sure why would you want to do other way round. Could you explain 
the real use case here?

nvmem file would read full nvmem size which is passed to it as regmap. 
So It would dump whatever the provider returns.
