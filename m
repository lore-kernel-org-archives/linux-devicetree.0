Definitely. I would even argue that not overwriting the DT should be the
default behaviour, and that you could have a compatibility mode that
repaint ancient DTs  if you want to. But at least having something would
be good. At the moment, my X-Gene board is screwed, as I don't have any
way to fix the bootloader (or even to download a binary).

The main problem is that there is several flavours of brokenness:

- GICC_CTLR@0, GICC_DIR@0x10000, size 128kB (X-Gene)
- GICC_CTLR@0, GICC_DIR@0x1000, size 64kB (Seattle)
- GICC_CTL@0xF000, GICC_DIR@0x10000, size 8kB (Juno)
- GICC_CTL@0, GICC_DIR@0x1000, size 8kB (HiKey)

Yes, they all have a GIC400, and yet they are all irritatingly non
compliant with SBSA. As far as I can tell, nobody has correctly
implemented the expected aliasing that would have made it work.

So either we add new compatibility strings describing all the possible
way people can break things, or we introduce something like dir-offset
and ctlr-offset that would tell the driver where the two sub-regions are
placed. The default values would be:

- When size is < 8kB -> invalid configuration, this is not a GIC400.
- When size is = 8kB -> ctlr-offset = 0, dir-offset = 0x1000
- When size is = 128kB -> ctlr-offset = 0xf000, dir-offset = 0x10000

For the two first braindead systems above:
- ctlr-offset = 0, dir-offset = 0x10000 (X-Gene)
- ctlr-offset = 0, dir-offset = 0x1000; (Seattle)

and that's just enough to get bare metal going.

When it comes to virtualization, this is hell:
- We need an API to be able to expose these various offsets to
userspace, so that QEMU/kvmtool can place the GICV region at the right
location (offset within a page).
- We will also miss the capability to trap GICV_DIR independently from
the rest of the VCPU interface on systems like Seattle, which is rather bad.
- Systems that look like Juno or HiKey cannot use virtualization with
64k pages, end of story.

After writing this, I'm feeling slightly depressed...
