So do we have a consensus on this topic?  Right now SPDX id is rarely
used in Linux kernel.  A grep of SPDX in the source code only shows
around 10 appearances.  Whether or not changing to promote the usage
of SPDX id in the future seems to be a good topic for broader
discussion.  And it would be good to have a kernel wide guideline as a
result.  I'm adding Linus Torvalds to the recipient, and hope he can
provide some of his insight to the issue.
