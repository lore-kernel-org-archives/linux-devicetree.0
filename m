This time I push a branch before sending out the patches. Also, I
think I'll postpone removal of hardcoded addresses until this is
sorted out. The patch set was growing way to quick and I have to
do this step-by-step for me and everybody else to actually understand ;)

So, at least the MVEBU guys should test the following branch on
their SoCs. Again, I have tested Dove and now confirmed that settings
are still correct. The others are compile-tested.

@Thomas, Gregory: Do you think that the above branch will be
restructured enough allow support for orion5x and mv78xx0? I had a
quick look at mach-{orion5x,mv78xx0}/mpp.h and didn't see anything
weird.
