The only potential issue with that approach is if the CODEC can be used
in a "simple" mode where e.g. no control GPIOs, regulator manipulation,
etc. are required, or in a more complex mode where such things are
required, you may end up with the device-specific binding being written
to the simple mode, and hence missing features required for the complex
mode. Having a separate simple binding prevents the device-specific
binding from being broken that way.

That said, it's probably better to simply get the device-specific
binding completely fleshed out and representing all resources the first
time around, then there's no issue either.
