Well - this "rename=94 was and still is not merged upstream, so it is an
unfortunate circumstance as I am going on vacation and can not create a
new patchset until I return. So please take it as a template
when applying it.

In my experience it is not needed for PCM, as the clock is set by the
bcm2835-i2s driver, so I left it out.

As I do not know how the orphan PWM clock would be used I can not comment
if this is really needed with PWM or not - it would just set the default
clock if it got referenced in the DT.

Thanks,
