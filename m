To explain a bit further, I've started with totally ignoring the device 
model just careing for the order in why drivers will be initialized.

Than the device model did come into my way. ;)

But it isn't any problem at all to extend the stuff to care for devices. 
That even  would reduce some code in dtc with the disadvantage that the 
sizes of blobs will slightly increase a bit more, because they then 
would include dependencies to devices too (instead of just dependencies 
between drivers).

So I'm absolutely open here. If using dependencies between devices is 
necessary or has advantages, that could be changed with changing a few 
lines.
