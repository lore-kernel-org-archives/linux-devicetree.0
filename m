The Compulab IoT Gateway is based on an NXP i.MX7D, dual core
Cortex-A7 clocking at 1GHz. It supports up to 2GB of DDR3,
and 32GB of eMMC flash. Onboard, there are two gigabit
ethernet controllers, 4 x USB2, RS485, and CAN.

It uses the same SoM as the cl-som-imx7, but includes a baseboard 
with additional I/O.

Compulab has provided patches for this platform based on v4.1. 
I've used these patches as reference to get things working on tip.

The entire series is based on v4.15-rc1.
