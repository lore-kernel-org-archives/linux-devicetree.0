Ok, good. The two drivers are almost the same, so squashing to a
generic one would be trivial.

We have the same problem on stm32, as just discussed with Andreas [0].
I decided to patch the bootloader to deassert timers reset, after
discussions with Rob Herring and Arnd.

Moving to a common driver, stm32 could use the same early init method
to initiliaze reset before timers.
