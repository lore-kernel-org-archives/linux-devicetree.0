I'm therefore assuming I can safely ignore it for now then.

OK... but what does "keep OFW available" mean? And what for?

Well, you'd need to tell the kernel about what memory area not to touch 
(given that memory is not in some area the kernel will touch anyway when 
it is in its early boot stage and still not smart enough to avoid it).

Then you'll need special code to perform those steps RMK already 
mentioned.  This is a bit like the low-level code for suspend/resume 
support is doing.  This is of course if I'm still guessing right about 
the whole purpose of this.

This certainly doesn't have to involve the core kernel.  A special 
module may even be sufficient to keep the complexity localized.  Just 
like low-level suspend/resume code is per SOC already anyway.

But again, what for?
