I can't speak for Russell, but I think his issue is addressed in v2.

pinctrl changes much more board to board, so it's more valuable to have
in device tree. The changes from board to board in the clock tree are
much less.

The binding defines connections on clocks between nodes. Whether this is
a single clock controller node with many outputs or a node per mux,
divider, gate, etc. is up to the implementer. I did the latter on
highbank because I've got about 8 clocks and half are the same (pll
outputs). Having worked on many generations of iMX and knowing all the
pitfalls of their clock controllers, I would do exactly what Shawn has
done for any part with complex clock trees. I don't think trying to
abstract things to completely generic code will be worth the effort or
be able to describe all the interactions between clocks.

The value in device tree is handling board differences as there are 10's
of boards per SOC.

Why don't you read v2 which removes the strings.

All this has been discussed already over the 2 years of iterations of
common struct clock and clock bindings.
