Vinod Koul is exploring this and ATM we are trying to sort out the hw 
setup. Hopefully we should be sorted with Qcom help!

There are two parts for device to be ready to talk at bus level:
1> power up and reset,
2> enumerate and assign a logical address by the slimbus controller.

First part as you said is already done in probe.
When second part happens when status callback is invoked, that is when 
the slimdevice is ready for any kind of communication at bus level.
