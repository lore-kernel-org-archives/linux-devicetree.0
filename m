Due to the shared nature of these clocks. Individual components cannot
be responsible for controlling these as this could break configurations
for other components that are sharing the clocks. Only the card driver
has visibility of all of the components and their requirements.

audio_pll is used by spdif out, parallel out, i2s out, and i2s in if
there are codecs on the i2s in path that make use of i2s_mclk and
dac_mclk (derived from audio_pll)

i2s_mclk and dac_mclk can be used by both the i2s in and i2s out paths
on some boards

Ok
