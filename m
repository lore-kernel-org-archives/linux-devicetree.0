We won't change the reg property value, the code I am about to post
provides stricter bindings, stricter semantics and extends bindings to
cater for arm 64-bit systems.

I thought this would break all code relying on /cpu nodes being /cpus node's
children. Furthermore, I was told that the /cpus node can only have /cpu nodes
as children.

If you wish so, we can define the topology in the /cpus node, fine by me.

We are defining the topology to decouple the cluster/core/thread concept
from the MPIDR. Having a reg property in the cluster (and core) nodes
would complicate things if that reg property must correspond to an MPIDR
bitfield. If it is meant to be just an enumeration at a given device tree
level, I am ok with changing that.

It is not a cpu node, it is a phandle property named cpu. Can you point
me to the ePAPR section where threads bindings are described please ? I have
not managed to find these details, I am reading version 1.0.

Thanks a lot for having a look !
