Yes, I believe that's correct. My original rationale for this patch was
that earlycon is generally preferred over earlyprintk since it doesn't
require SoC-specific kernels, but now I'm not convinced that either of
the two parameters belongs in the dts file. As you point out,
earlyprintk can do things that earlycon cannot, and in the common case,
neither are needed.

Perhaps removing the bootargs property altogether is more correct. I'm
happy to send another patch to do that if you concur.

No explicit MMIO info is needed for earlycon on DT systems where an
stdout-path property is present. I've tested the patch as-is and the
early output works fine.
