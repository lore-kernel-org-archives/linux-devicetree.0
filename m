I can find a number of situations in the kernel, where this just isn't followed,
for device specific bindings. What percentage have to follow this for it to be
'standard'? Is this documented somewhere so it's clear for those writing
drivers which need to use DT bindings? I had a quick look and couldn't find
anything on this.

For a lot of device specific bindings, you will need to read the associated
documentation, and possibly the datasheet, to understand what it's for, and what
values are valid. I don't see this suffix really saving you any time. For
standard frameworks ok, but here it seems overkill.
