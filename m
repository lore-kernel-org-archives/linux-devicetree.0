Quickly I created a patch (pasted below) for review,


commit 22e846837d425ff6f98b087b8f93989dd0cfc666

     regulator: 88pm800: Add support for configuration of dual phase on 
BUCK1

     88PM860 device supports dual phase mode on BUCK1 output.
     In normal usecase, BUCK1A and BUCK1B operates independently with 3A
     capacity. And they both can work as a dual phase providing 6A capacity.

     This patch adds support for regulator_ops.set_current_limit() 
callback fn,
     in turn enabling support for current min and max supply constraint 
on BUCK1
     (and optionally on BUCK1B). Based on that driver enables dual-phase 
mode.

     (and optionally on BUCK1B). Based on that driver enables dual-phase 
mode.

     Note that, if max current supply constraint is > 3A on BUCK1(A) 
then driver
     enables the dual-phase mode, irrespective of BUCK1B constraint.
