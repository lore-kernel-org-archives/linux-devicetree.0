All Rockchip manuals I have (from rk3066 forward) state that the oscillator 
used here must be 24MHz, so I guess it should be ok in the main dtsi files.

In the very unlikely case that a hw designer ignored every piece of 
documentation I guess they could simply reset the clock-frequency value in 
their board dts.

I'll rename it.
