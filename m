Yes and no.  We are trying to describe a real topology here, but only
because there are salient features that the kernel genuinely does
need to know about if we want to be able to abstract this kind of thing.

It's not just about AXI.

Things like CCI-400 ("cache coherent interconnect") and its successors 
have real run-time control requirements on each connection to the bus.
(The "port" terminology is used in the CCI documentation, but in any
case the concept of a link between a device and a bus should be a pretty
generic concept, not tied to a specific name or a specific interconnect.)

If I need to turn on the bus interface for device X, in need to know
how to tell the bus which interface to poke -- hence the need for
a "port ID".  Of course, we're free to choose other names.

The master-slave link concept is not supposed to be a new concept at
all: DT already has this concept.  All we are aiming to add here is the
ability to describe cross-links that ePAPR cannot describe directly.

Bear in mind that "fancy interconnect with address remapping
capabilities" probably means at least two independent components on an
ARM SoC.

To avoid excessive code fragmentation we'd want a driver for each, not a
driver per every possible pairing.  The pairing could be different on
every port even in a single SoC, though I hope we will never see that.

In axi { axi_switch {} }, are you describing two levels of bus, or
one?  I'm guessing one, but then the nested node looks a bit weird.

Just to call this out, the linkage is *not* guaranteed to be acyclic.

If you connect pass-through devices (i.e., buses) round in a cycle,
you may get transactions going round and round forever, so we should
never see that in a system.

However, there's nothing to stop a DMA controller's master side being
looped back so that it can access its own slave interface.  This is the
normal situation for coherent DMA, since the whole point there is
that the DMA controller should shares its system view closely with
the CPUs, including some levels of cache.

(This does mean that the DMA may be able to program itself -- but I don't
claim that this is useful.  Rather, it's a side-effect of providing a
coherent system view.)

Agree -- this concept of a master/slave link is a really generic concept,

The complete set of properties associated with each link will be
specific to each different interconnect, and possibly from port to port:
_that_ stuff would be described by separate, non-generic properties
defined per interconnect type.

But to do DMA mapping, you should only need to know what master/slave
links exist, and any associated mappings.

Do you mean the top-level bus node in the DT and its contents, or
something else?

If so, agreed ...

... that could work, although putting the links in the natural places
in the DT directly feels cleaner that stashing a crib table elsewhere
in the DT.  That's partly cosmetic, I think both could work?
