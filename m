Here makes sense because you may not be able to mount and read
debugfs. That's the reason for the timeout too. Otherwise, debugfs
could be used to trigger the same thing.

They are aligned at least in that both use dev_name(), but I don't
think we can align completely as we need the context in the log where
as reading a file you know the context already.

Agreed.

The default is -1 which is disabled. Scheduling work in that case
would give us a very long timeout instead.

If the timeout is 0, then this never needs to run because
driver_deferred_probe_check_state will immediately timeout. Running it
would be harmless though as it would just do an extra run of deferred
probe wq.
