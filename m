This patch series adds the device tree support to C_CAN/D_CAN
controller with pinmux configuration and device tree data
addition to corresponding dts and dtsi files.

Also adds Runtime PM support to C_CAN/D_CAN controller.

These patches have been tested on AM335x EVM using some additional
patches to add device tree data to EVM dts files and to initialize
D_CAN RAM. D_CAN raminit is controlled from control module register.
This patch will be submitted once control module MFD driver support
is added to mainline.

Due to lack of hardware I am not able to test c_can functionality.
I appreciate if anyone can test c_can functionality with this patch
series.

First and last patches applies on top of linux-next tree, 2nd and
3rd patches applies on linux-omap tree.

Changes from v1:
	- Separated 4 patches into CAN driver specific and device
	  tree data addition specific.
	- Incorporated Marc's comments on v1
	  * Modified c_can_dev_id enum to handle both devtype and
	    platform device id index.
	  * Removed "legacy bosch,c_can_platform" from DT bindings
