I'm not reusing the name - in fact I set the prefix to earlydev_
exactly in order to not confuse anyone. I'm also not reusing any code
in the second series.

Yes, this is a good idea, but what about the sh-specific drivers that
rely on it? Is including headers from arch/ in driver code still an
accepted practice?

I don't see why we wouldn't want to unify these two cases. The best
solution to me seems having only one entry point into the driver code
- the probe() function stored in platform_driver - whether we're
probing it from DT, platform data, ACPI or early boot code.
