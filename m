Thanks, Andrew. A summary of all tags so far:

When I sent out this patch set I missed including the previous
tested-bys:
Tested-by: Jerome Forissier <jerome.forissier-QSEj5FYQhm4dnm+yROfE0A@public.gmane.org> (HiKey)
Tested-by: Volodymyr Babchuk <vlad.babchuk-Re5JQEeQqe8AvxtiuMwx3w@public.gmane.org>

Then there's also the acked-by from Andreas which should have been
included even if the mail now bounces:
Acked-by: Andreas Dannenberg <dannenberg-l0cyMroinI0@public.gmane.org>

The DT patch has (since v8):
Acked-by: Rob Herring <robh-DgEjT+Ai2ygdnm+yROfE0A@public.gmane.org>

Thanks,
Jens
