Using overlays to layer in a proprietary device blob for a proprietary driver?
No. I don't. It just seems like a natural solution. Do I have more examples
where FreeBSD has to deviate because the DT is actually Linux
specific and does a poor job of modeling the hardware and instead
reflects the Linux driver model? I have plenty of those...
