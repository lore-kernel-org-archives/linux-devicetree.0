So to be clear, we would get:

sun6i.dtsi, which has everything which is currently in sun6i-a31.dtsi, minus
the compatible for the main pinctrl node.

sun6i-a31.dtsi, which includes sun6i.dtsi, and sets the compatible for the main
pinctrl node.

sun6i-a31s.dtsi, idem.

BTW as for the 100% compatible thing, I've gotten confirmation from Allwinner
that the A31 and A31s are the same die in a different package.

This also explains why when working on DRAM controller support for the A31s I noticed
that the auto-detect code for the A31 worked fine, and figured out there was only one
channel without any issues, the second channel actually is there, it is just not routed
to the outside.

Which brings us to the question should we differentiate between them at all ? I think
that from a pinctrl pov it makes sense to differentiate, and that for the rest we should
try not to needlessly differentiate.

Same discussion as before, if I copy a file you authored it still is yours _copy_right

Ok. Is this already fixed in dts-for-3.19 ? Currently this patch-set is based on
3.18 + some cherry picked patches from dts-for-3.19, if this is fixed there, I
guess I need to cherry pick some more to avoid conflicts.

Although this is not a "compatible" I would like to treat it as such
and just keep this as "allwinner,sun6i-a31", as it is 100% compatible.

According to the user manual, yes.

Yep, it is the same die.
