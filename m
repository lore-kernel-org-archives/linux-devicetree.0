The last version was more generic, but it was obvious that doing that
was pointless with current code structure. You have a call sequence
like either:

generic get -> DT specific get -> generic poke  -> DT specific poke

or

generic get -> DT specific get -> DT specific poke

v2 did the former and this version does the latter. However, for some
reason with regulators this is not all contained within
of_get_regulator.

Agreed on this point.
