No, but I didn't state it very clearly.

In this:

	parent {
		child {
			ranges = < ... >;
			dma-ranges = < ... >;
		};
	};

There are two transaction flows being described.  There are transactions
from parent -> child, for which "ranges" describes the mappings, and
there are transactions from child -> parent, for which "dma-ranges"
describes the mappings.

The name "dma-ranges" obfuscates this symmetry, so it took me a while
to figure out what it really means -- maybe I'm still confused, but
I think that's the gist of it.


For the purposes of cross-links, my plan was that we interpret all
those links as "forward" (i.e., parent -> child) links, where the
referencing node is deemed to be the parent, and the referenced node is
deemed to be the child. Just as in the ePAPR case, the associated mapping
is then described by "ranges".

For any 1:N relationship between nodes, you can describe the
_relationship_ by putting properties on the nodes at the "1" end.  This
is precisely how "ranges" and "dma-ranges" work.

The N:M case can be resolved by inserting simple-bus nodes into any
links with non-default mappings: i.e., you split each affected link in
two, with a simple-bus node in the middle describing the mapping:

root: / {
	ranges;
	...

	master@1 {
		slave {
			ranges = < ... >;
			slaves = <&root>;
		};
	};

	master@2 {
		slave {
			slaves = < &root &master2_dma_slave >;
			slave-names = "config-fetch", "dma";

		master2_dma_slave: dma-slave {
				ranges = < ... >;
				slaves = <&root>;
			};
		};
	};

	master@3 {
		slaves = <&root>;
	};
};


Here, there are three master devices, one with two different mastering
roles.

master@2's configuration data fetch mechanism accesses the root bus
node, but with some remapping.  master@2 also does bulk DMA, which
has no remapping.

master@1 masters on / with its own remapping.  master@3 masters on
/ with no remapping.

(This is a silly made-up system: I don't claim I've seen something like
this.)

I thought about this possibility, but was worried that the "slaves"
property would become awkward to parse, where except for the "master id"
concept, all these attributes are well described by ePAPR already for
bus nodes if we can figure out how to piggyback on them -- hence my
alternative approach explained above.

How to describe the "master id" is particularly problematic and may
be a separate discussion.  It can get munged or remapped as it
passes through the interconnect: for example, a PCI device's ID 
accompanying an MSI write may be translated once as it passes from
the PCI RC to an IOMMU, then again before it reaches the GIC.

In the "windowed IOMMU" case, address bits are effectively being
mapped to ID bits as they reach IOMMU.

An IOMMU also does a complete mapping of ID+address -> ID'+address'
(although programmable rather than static and unprobeable, so the
actual mappings for an IOMMU won't be in the DT).

I avoided the word "dma" because I found it confusing initially.

In the hardware there is no difference at all between "dma" and
bus mastering by CPUs, at least not in the ARM SoC world.

"DMA" suggests a relatively dumb peripheral doing grunt work on behalf
of a CPU.  Viewing pagetable fetches and polygon rendering or
RenderScript-style computataion offload done by a GPU as "DMA" seems a
bit of a stretch.

That said, DT is intended for use by OSes, so if it is CPU-centric,
that's OK (it already is CPU-centric, anyway).  A name is just a name;
so long as bindings are understandable, the choice of name shouldn't
matter too much.

My expectation is that subnodes would only be useful in special cases in
any case.

We can remove the special "slave" name, because there's nothing to
stop us referencing other random nested nodes with the "slaves" property.

That's my thought.  If there turns out to be a really good reason to
describe cycles then we can cross that bridge* when we come to it,
but it's best to forbid it until/unless the need for it is proven.

(*no pun intended)

Note that a certain kind of trivial cycle will always be created
when a node refers back to its parent:

root: / {
	ranges;

	iommu {
		reg = < ... >;
		slaves = <&root>;
	};
};

ePAPR says that if there is no "ranges" property, then the parent
node cannot access any address of the child -- we can interpret
this as saying that transactions do not propagate.  "ranges" with
an empty value imples a complete 1:1 mapping, which we can interpret
as transactions being forwarded without any transformation.

Crucially, "iommu" must not have a "ranges" property in this case,
because this would permit a static routing cycle root -> iommu ->
root.


Providing that the only devices that master on iommu are not
themselves bridges reachable from /, there is no cycle --
a given transaction will issued to the iommu will sooner or later hit
something that is not a bridge and disappear.

Note that there is no cycle through the "reg" property on iommu:
"reg" indicates a sink for transactions; "slaves" indicates a
source of transactions, and "ranges" indicates a propagator of
transactions.

"dma-ranges" indicates that the children of the node _might_ be
sources of transactions (but that does not mean that they definitely
are) -- and that the parent node acts as a bridge for those transactions,
forwarding them back to its own parent or children depending on the
address.
