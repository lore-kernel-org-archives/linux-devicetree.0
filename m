This is not a valid interrupt specifier for GICv3, as the 3rd field
shouldn't bear this 0xff thing.

Something is wrong here. Either you are missing GICH and GICV (assuming
you have legacy support), or you have an extra GICC region (which
doesn't make sense on its own).

You're also missing the maintenance interrupt.

Has Anapurna really built a GICv3 without an ITS?
