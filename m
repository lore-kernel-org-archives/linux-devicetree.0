Not really needed. I simply wanted to know the state of support for this
part under a non-OTG design. If it works, very nice. If it doesn't, it
can be fixed in the driver (though it might be complicated).

And yet it is not used on page 7. I would trust the actual schematics
more than the summary graph.

In general, some pins in the pin group might have other uses, so
either we set it to always-on, or have the pinctrl driver deal with
enabling it, or have every peripheral driver handle it. The second
option is a bit complicated, as it would require a separate device
apart from the pinctrl driver to handle the regulators. Otherwise
if the pinctrl driver is needed for whatever interface needed to
talk to the PMIC, you get a cyclic probe dependency. As for the
third, it would be a major pain to have to do this for every
peripheral we use, unless there's some sort of framework that
deals with power sequencing, which there currently isn't.

However in this case I seem to have been misled by the schematic.
It shows UART and PCM also being used for Bluetooth, but the chip
(RTL8189) does not have these functions. So for this it's actually
easier. We don't need it to be always-on.
