Once a platform device (with the platform bus as its parent) is
retrieved from the deferred queue, both the parent and the device in
question are locked (because of the USB stuff mentioned below). If
that device depends on another device whose parent is the platform bus
and we try to probe it (useless, but I don't see a good way of
avoiding it) then we'll deadlock when device_attach locks that device.

This commit introduced locking of a device's parent before it's
probed, mainly for USB interfaces:
