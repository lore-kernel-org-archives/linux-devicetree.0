In the H3, A83T and A64, there is only one DE.
If many DEs in a SoC, there may be either one DRM device per DE or one
DRM device for the whole system. In this last case, the (global) DE
would have many resources (many I/O memory maps / IRQs..) and the
physical DE of each endpoint would be indicated by the position of its
phandle in the 'ports' array (DT documentation).

LCD is the same as CRTC. I don't think people will connect old CRT's to
their new ARM boards. LCD's may be panels, modern TV sets, or any
digital display. The word LCD seems clearer to me in this context, even
if there may a DAC as an ancoder.

Here is the DT (I am using back 'CRTC'):

	de: display-controller@xxx {
		...
	};
	crtc0: crt-controller@xxx{
		...
		display-controller =3D <&de>;
		ports {
			...		/* to the crtc0 connectors */
		}
	};
	crtc1: crt-controller@xxx{
		...
		display-controller =3D <&de>;
		ports {
			...		/* to the crtc1 connectors */
		};
	};

There are 2 DRM devices: one on crtc0, the other one on crtc1.
The DE device is isolated. But, to treat the planes, it must receive
information about the CRTCs. How?

This is not a random example. There was a thread about the 'ports'
phandle in the DT definition of the IMX video subsystem, and what kind
of OF function should be used (see one of my previous mails). In the DRI
list, nobody objected about the phandle by itself.

I think that we will end in agreeing on the words. We just need some
time!
Here is how I understand the Allwinner's DE2:

- the TCON is the piece of hardware which gets some memory area and
  sends it to a bus according to some configuation (screen resolution,
  timings...). The bus data are encoded and transmitted to the connector.
  At the end, the display device receives frames. So, going back to the
  TCON, the memory are is the frame buffer.

- this frame buffer is virtual, empty, 'dumb', it is a dumb panel!
  It is filled by planes. This job is done by a specific image
  processor, the one contained in the DE2.

- the DE2 processor gets the plane source images from the SoC memory.
  It adjusts the images according to many configuration parameters and
  includes the result into the frame buffer.

So:
	LCD =3D CRTC =3D frame buffer =3D dumb panel =3D TCON

- LCD =3D hardware piece of a display device (terminal side) which renders
  the colored pixels in a digital way. By extension, the hardware part
  (computer side) of a display engine which handles the definitions of
  a digital or analog physical display device. By extension also,
  the software structure (driver side) which defines a physical screen.

- CRTC =3D DRM software entity which handles the definitions of a screen,
  but not just a CRT.

- frame buffer =3D piece of memory which contains the images which are
  sent to a screen.

- dumb panel =3D abstract entity which defines the characteristics of a
  physical screen.

You may note that, in the DE2 scheme, the TCON and LCD are not in the
same (software) device while they are part of the same DRM software
entity, the CTRC.

Sorry, but I don't like to run useless code for pure static definition.

Your DRM device is useless. It is simpler to have the DRM device as the
display engine.
Also, maybe, you have not the constraint the DE being shared between
2 CRTCs.

It seems you did not look at what I have coded...

I'd be glad to know how you can have a hardware cursor without defining
it in drm_crtc_init_with_planes().
