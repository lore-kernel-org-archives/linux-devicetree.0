That is true, but I wasn't sure taht this function was part of the probe
function.  Its only reference is in:

static struct pinctrl_ops at91_pctrl_ops = {
        .get_groups_count       = at91_get_groups_count,
        .get_group_name         = at91_get_group_name,
        .get_group_pins         = at91_get_group_pins,
	.pin_dbg_show           = at91_pin_dbg_show,
        .dt_node_to_map         = at91_dt_node_to_map,
        .dt_free_map            = at91_dt_free_map,
};

Working backwards, one possible call site is pinctrl_get, which is an
exported function.  Is it safe to assume that it will always be called
from within a probe function?

thanks,
