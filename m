translation tables convert virtual addresses to physical addresses.
Here, we are only talking about physical addresses. There is an overlap
between the physical addresses used by the RAM, and the physical
addresses at which I/O devices are visible.

And I'm not sure the SDRAM address decoding windows allows to split the
first 4 GB of RAM into two areas, one that would be mapped starting at
physical address 0x0, and another area that would be mapped at a
different address (above 4 GB).

However, I'm unsure why 0xC0000000 was chosen. Why not 0xD0000000,
where the internal registers currently start?

Best regards,

Thomas
