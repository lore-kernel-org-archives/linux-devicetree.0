I was just suggesting that when the core tells the regulator driver to
disable itself that the regulator driver tell RPMh to not only disable
itself but also (temporarily) vote for a lower voltage.  When the core
tells the regulator to re-enable itself then the regulator driver
restores the original voltage vote (or applies any vote that might
have been attempted while the regulator was disabled).  That wouldn't
require any regulator core changes.
