It's either memreserve or not described at all. This should only be
needed when secure world is limited in which memory it can use for
shared memory. Currently all OP-TEE ports uses reserved shared memory,
but we're moving away from it to avoid the problem with updating DT.

OK, I'll add something.

The kernel-side does all the direct communication since there's where
the SMC is done, but one level above most of the communication is
terminated in user space. Loading of Trusted Applications and other file
system access is done in by a helper process in user space,
tee-supplicant. A large part of the OP-TEE message protocol is
transparent to the kernel.

We're trying to not exclude any TEE implementation by having this low
level TEE_IOC_CMD instead of a high level interface. The problem with
the different TEEs is that they are designed differently and we haven't
been able to find a high level interface that suits all. Applications
aren't expected to use TEE_IOC_CMD directly, instead there's supposed to
be a client lib wich wraps the kernel interface and provides a higher
level interface, for instance a Global Platform Client API in the case
of a GP TEE.

For OP-TEE we're using the same protocol all the way down to user space,
the advantage is that it's only one protocol to keep track of and we
don't need to translate the entire message (we do need to copy it,
excluding the payload) each time the message is passed to the next
memory space. In the presence of a hypervisor we have
user space -> kernel -> hypervisor -> secure world
Unfortunately some fields has a different meaning in user space and
kernel space. I'll address this in the documentation.

The OP-TEE helper process, tee-supplicant, is specific to only OP-TEE.
Other TEEs uses helper processes too, but what they do depend on the
design of the TEE. As a consequence more or less all TEEs needs
something specific for that particular TEE in user space to be fully
functional.

To summarize, the current assumption is that all TEEs can't use the same
high level interface. Instead we need to provide a way for each TEE to
have their own low level interface which should be wrapped in a user
space library to provide a more reasonable interface to the client
application.

We have OPTEEM_FUNCID_GET_OS_UUID and OPTEEM_FUNCID_GET_OS_REVISION
which the client can use to identify which particular OP-TEE it's
talking to. This is not so interesting for the driver, but the client
may care when there's more than one TEE using the OP-TEE message
protocol in a single system.

There's also OPTEEM_FUNCID_CALLS_UID and OPTEEM_FUNCID_CALLS_REVISION
(required by SMC Calling Convention), but those are expected to return
static values except OPTEEM_REVISION_MINOR which would be increased if
some new message type is added in the future.

To summarize, OPTEEM_FUNCID_CALLS_* identifies the OP-TEE message
protocol and OPTEEM_FUNCID_GET_OS_* identifies the OP-TEE OS
implementation.

The documentation is currently include/uapi/linux/optee_msg.h and
drivers/tee/optee/optee_smc.h. I'll add something under Documentation.

There's more details at http://shorl.com/lubopribokygy , but that's not
entirely updated with this driver.

OK, sounds good. Where should I put the smccc.h file to be able to share
it between arch/arm and arch/arm64, under include/asm-generic?

OPTEE_SMC_SHM_NONCACHED is generally not used, but supposed to match how
the kernel maps noncached memory. OP-TEE maps this as Device-nGnRE
Outer sharable memory (MAIR ATTR = 0x04)

OPTEE_SMC_SHM_CACHED is cached memory with settings matching how the
kernel maps cached memory. OP-TEE maps this as as Normal Memory,
Outer Write-back non-transient Outer Read Allocate Outer Write Allocate
Inner Write-back non-transient Inner Read Allocate Inner Write Allocate
Inner sharable (MAIR ATTR = 0xff).

OP-TEE is more or less always compiled for a specific platform so if the
kernel uses some other mapping for a particular platform we'll change the
OP-TEE settings to be compatible with the kernel on that platform.

Agree.

buf_ptr is a physical address (IPA or PA depending on context) outside
user space, in user space it's an offset into the shm_ref.

shm_ref is a pointer to struct tee_shm in the kernel, an opaque handle
in secure world, and a file descriptor (connected to a struct tee_shm)
in user space.

No, this is a value parameter, each value parameter can carry three
value. An OP-TEE message carry the number of parameters specified with
num_params in struct opteem_arg.

You're right it should go into another file not exposed to user space.
