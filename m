Hello Martin,

thanks for the contribution!

Unfortunately [PATCH 2/2] only hit the devicetree mailing list but not 
the linux-can mailing list for the review.

Btw. I already have two questions from the description:

Seems you improved the SPI handling here. Would it make sense to 
separate the SPI-related part of the code to a separate C-file so that 
the existing mcp251x driver can benefit from these improvements too?

Are you sure drops are taking place in the network layer? Can you give 
me some more details about this statement?

Best regards,
Oliver
