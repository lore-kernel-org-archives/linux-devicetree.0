On DT the situation with generic drivers is much better than it is on
ACPI so we're actually able to create jacks purely from DT with both the
simple and graph cards.  This was what drove the creation of the generic
jack operation rather than device specific function calls, Bard realized
that the device specific calls were all very similar and adding the call
allowed the generic cards to work with jacks.

Yes, I think so.
