Subject: [PATCH 23/25] arm: da8: dts: Remove leading 0x and 0s from bindings notation

Improve the DTS files by removing all the leading "0x" and zeros to fix the
following dtc warnings:

Warning (unit_address_format): Node /XXX unit name should not have leading "0x"

and

Warning (unit_address_format): Node /XXX unit name should not have leading 0s

Converted using the following command:

find . -type f \( -iname *.dts -o -iname *.dtsi \) -exec sed -i -e "s/@\([0-9a-fA-FxX\.;:#]+\)\s*{/@\L\1 {/g" -e "s/@0x\(.*\) {/@\1 {/g" -e "s/@0+\(.*\) {/@\1 {/g" {} +^C

For simplicity, two sed expressions were used to solve each warnings separately.

To make the regex expression more robust a few other issues were resolved,
namely setting unit-address to lower case, and adding a whitespace before the
the opening curly brace:

https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Linux#Linux_conventions

This will solve as a side effect warning:

Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /XXX@<UPPER> simple-bus unit address format error, expected "<lower>"

This is a follow up to commit 4c9847b7375a ("dt-bindings: Remove leading 0x from bindings notation")
