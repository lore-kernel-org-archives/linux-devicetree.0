I don't think that "fall back to using stuff from /chosen" is generally
useful. Indeed, of all the properties I can see mentioned for /chosen
("stdout-path", "linux,syrq-reset-seq", "linux,pci-probe-only",
"bootargs", "initrd_start" and "initrd_end"), only stdout-path is likely
to be usable by the Secure OS as a fall back. So I'd rather make this an
exception rather than the rule.

Agreed.

Yup.

OK, can we agree on the following?

- The secure OS is supposed to get its boot data from /secure-chosen
- Only the stdout-path path property is defined currently. Its
definition is the same as for /chosen. If not present but /secure-chosen
is present, it takes no default value. If /secure-chosen does not exist
however, it defaults to the value of /chosen/stdout-path.
- As we add properties to /secure-chosen we'll see if it makes sense to
allow fall back to their counterparts in /chosen (which I don't expect
to happen too often).

If that sounds good to you I'll send a V2.
