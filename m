Sure, Will fix that in next version.

Am Ok with this, naming.

But I think we can just use "qcom,msm8916-lpass-codec" for the codec 
block in side the lpass, as SOC seems to be more generic term.

It depends, How you want to model the driver.
But in this case, most of the codec stuff like interrupts are handled in 
pmic, and the lpass side of it had just few mapped registers, so making 
a syscon for the lpass and accessing it in the pmic driver made more 
sense for me, if not we are going to complicate the driver design.
