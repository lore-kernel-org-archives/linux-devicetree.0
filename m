Hmm, not really. While I'd love to have a good common set of reasonably
generic partition parsers that we could always run on all MTDs (or in
this case, all physmap_of MTDs) similar to how the block subsystem does
it, I don't think that is really workable here, as there is too much
variation in parsers and mamy of them actually scan the whole flash (or
at least, the headers of each block). This can get very expensive, and
potentially leaves room for false matches, especially when you start
layering on all the other potential parsers others might want to use.

IOW, this solution is not scalable IMO. In previous discussions, I think
we've agreed that partition parsing must be informed by platform
knowledge.

Right. I was just mentioning that this binding:

  (1) allows people to specify nonsensical things like "ofpart" and
  "cmdlinepart" in their DT and
  (2) allows people to specify DTs that *don't* allow developer
  overrides like cmdlinepart (e.g., the partition layout is corrupted,
  so we want to boot a recovery kernel with a predetermined
  'mtdparts=...' parameter)

Neither is directly related to your use of AFS, but it's just part of my
thoughts on codifying the use of this binding.

I would prefer a new binding. And personally, I'd like to get something
like this extended to all MTDs (there are other users asking for similar
things), but I haven't made the time to write the patch :(

Seems OK to me. Again, I'd prefer this not live in physmap_of.c, but if
that's the expedient solution, I could probably take it from there.

I'd rather not take this patch if we can safely pivot to an improved
binding, but I'm not sure if that violates the DT policy party line :)

Right.
