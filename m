Whoops. Will fix that in v4.

>From looking at the code in sound/soc/sti/uniperif_player.c, there is
one sysconf register called "Audio glue config" which is shared by all
of the uniperif IP instances. This binding is being used to generate a
bitoffset into this shared register based on the instance of the IP.

I guess the alternative is to have an explosion of compatibles?

st,sti-uni-player-1
st,sti-uni-player-2
st,sti-uni-player-3

If not what would you recommend instead? :-)

I don't currently have access to the functional spec for this
IP block, but I have asked ST to send it to me to see if there is any
other way to derive this information (although I suspect there won't
be).

FYI I didn't actually write or upstream that driver. However fdma is
a depedency of the ASoC driver and it is required to get working audio
upstream. It's also worth pointing out that this ASoC driver has been
merged for a while, so I'm not sure what your opinion is of now changing
the DT bindings? Obviously it is currently not used by anyone upstream
due to the missing fdma depedency.

regards,

Peter.
