Given that we won't boot secondary CPUs without an enable-method, we
could leave them in, but in a currently-unusable state. That would allow
a bootloader to patch in the relevant properties to boot them.

If you add the nodes later with PSCI properties, users with existing
firmware will expect their board to boot. So I'd recommendd that the
bootloader patches that in, or that the firmware is ready prior to this
being merged. I suspect that the former is more likely to be possible.

Ok. If that's the case each should have the same compatible string.

Thanks,
