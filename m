I see no problem with restricting this to platform devices with an
of_node (or a fwnode if we still want to address machines with ACPI).

Yeah, I'm not sure how much that could be a problem. Maybe if a
non-platform device has a match and probes before a platform device
that has been delayed and is a dependency of it. That could be a
problem in platforms that don't do on-demand probing because of the
lack of firmware data.
