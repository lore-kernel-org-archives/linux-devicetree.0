Patching up other PCI bus drivers would be deferred to a different patch 
set, as I have no way to test it.

The of_irq_parse_and_map_pci() call in arch/arm64/kernel/pci.c 
(pcibios_add_device) seems to work for me.

I did send a patch recently to make it quite emitting erroneous error 
messages for PCI devices that have no irq pin.
