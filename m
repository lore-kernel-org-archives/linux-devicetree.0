To be precise, I'm talking about modeling an IP block as a single node.
So if you have one clock generator IP block then you have one node. If
you have more than one clock generator block then you have more than one
node. Re-using the qcom example there are compatible strings for two
different clock generator blocks named gcc and mmcc, respectively. So
two DT nodes in the case for msm platforms that have one gcc instance
and one rcg instance.

Additionally other IP blocks may have internal clocks that can be
modeled as part of that node. OMAP's Display SubSystem (DSS) and Image
Signal Processor (ISP) blocks all have internal clocks that are modeled
through the clock framework. (There are no DT bindings for that stuff,
but the concept still applies)

Yeah, this is pretty common. The compatible string should reflect the IP
block as a whole, not just the clocks part of it. Lots of vendors have
PRCMs or PRCMUs or CARs or whatever.

Check out the recent series to have the reset bits and regulator support
added to the qcom binding[1]. (I'm using qcom quite a bit in my examples
but they are not the first to add reset control to their clock driver. I
think Tegra did it first...)

Yeah, I'm not sure of the state of syscon. And modeling this stuff in
the clock driver isn't the end of the world. There might be better
places than drivers/clk/* for sure... I sometimes joke that the name of
the IP block determines where the code lands. If it is Power, Reset &
Clock Manager (several platforms use this acronym) then it can end up in
drivers/clk or drivers/reset really easily. Same for Clock and Reset IP
blocks (Tegra).

I'm not a big fan of DT stable ABI, but if you plan on changing it for
3.17 why not just do it the right way the first time? And switching to
syscon is not a hard requirement. I'm OK with you putting the reset and
regulator stuff in the clock driver if that makes the most sense for
your platform (especially if registers are shared and the same locks
need to be used, etc).

What do you think?
