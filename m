Ugh. Okay my blood sugar was super low. Can I just condense that into
I agree with Russell and the binding makes no sense once it gets past
the simple definition described in the binding?

If we take the pinctrl mess as an example, all the DT serves to do is
define an SoC-specific or family-specific binding into data the
pinctrl subsystem can use, via an SoC-specific abstraction in a driver
to make a generic subsystem in Linux work the way it should.

The common clock subsystem is no different - divider, fixed factor,
fixed rate, mux, gate, highbank (??) are defined in a way that
abstracts most of the actual SoC-specific stuff out to register
offsets, values, bit definitions and masks.

Right now for i.MX we have several abstraction interfaces
(imx_clk_XXX) which move values from tables around and call the
appropriate common clock function to register the clock. These
abstractions are identical for all the possible i.MX SoCs
(imx_clk_gate2, imx_clk_mux etc.) and move the values around so they
can be passed to clk_register_##same.

So if we can define a fixed-clock, why can't we define an
fsl,gated-clock or fsl,muxed-clock which defines an i.MX clock of that
type, and a much smaller subset of code that stuffs these values in
through a small abstraction and remove all these seperate
clk-imx51-imx53.c, clk-imx6q.c, clk-imx31.c files which are sharing
common functionality into one mega-abstraction which works across the
whole family?

The way I understand the binding right now (and I'm looking at this;
http://git.linaro.org/gitweb?p=people/mturquette/linux.git;a=blob_plain;f=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt;hb=766e6a4ec602d0c107553b91b3434fe9c03474f4),
this is entirely what the clock binding is saying we should do. But I
don't understand why we're naming inputs and outputs, but not defining
how these signals are routed (possibly through gate bits in registers)
and leaving that down to some driver somewhere. Or why we have to name
clocks twice, once for the canonical name of the output in reference
to a higher level or root clock "uart_serial", vs. a driver-level name
for that input or output in the driver ("per"), since most clocks at
the driver level can't be re-used for other things anyway. If they
could, the whole prepare/unprepare and some explicit parenting/muxing
of clocks would handle that anyway so that the clock was enabled while
there was at least one user.

I do understand that in Shawn's patch and using UART as an example
again, "ipg" and "per" are definitely needed by the driver, and these
names are defined by the driver and implicit in the documentation to
enable the use of this unit, but at the end of the day the definition
at the *device* level (uart@) makes no sense except to perform a
lookup on a string, and in the end this string lookup only gets done
at the driver probe time anyway. With a standard definition of these
"ipg" and "per" strings per family of SoC or even in a generic fashion
across all possible SoCs (in this case, both are defined using
imx_clk_gate2()) then a node defining that clock and it's magical
driver-specific name would work just as well by phandle reference, and
it's parents are referenced by phandle, and all this stays within
SoC-specific abstraction of the common clocks and turns into normal
common clock structure stuff anyway (so you still get to do a string
lookup, but it's being stuffed by an i.MX driver and registered from
data it pulled from the DT).

Wouldn't we rather have a single device tree parser and clock
registration for i.MX than the current 7 which would get split into 7
clock registration drivers with some helpers that parsed half of it
via device tree? I don't really see what benefit you get out of going
for the halfway-defined model.
