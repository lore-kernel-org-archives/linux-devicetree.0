Yes.

Right.

I'm only talking about new bindings, no need to change existing
bindings. For new bindings it surely has benefits when we can just point
to a well established binding. Right now the existing bindings for the
pin controllers which independently control each pin differ a lot.

The next step should be to integrate the above into the pinctrl
documentation.
