This series adds Spreadtrum clock support together with its binding
documentation and devicetree data.

Any comments would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Chunyan

Changes from V6: (https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/27/217)
* Changed to use "//" format for the file header
* Addressed Stephen's comments:
  - Put the common macros in clk-provider.h instead of clk_common.h, also removed
    the same macros from sunxi-ng/ccu_common.h and zte/clk.h;
  - Removed CLK_FIXED_RATE(), and moved the fixed rate clocks from driver to DT;
  - Use devm_of_clk_add_hw_provider() instead;
  - Removed sprd_regmap_{read|write}(), use regmap API directly;
  - Removed all full stop on error messages.
* Use IS_ERR_OR_NULL() instead of IS_ERR() for checking regmap pointers;

Changes from V5: (https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/20/21)
* Rebased the whole patch-set to 4.15-rc1;
* Fixed kbuild-test warnings;
* Switched to use devm_clk_hw_register() instead of clk_hw_register();
* Removed useless debug information from sc9860-clk.c.

Changes from V4: (https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/10/30)
* Added acked-by of Rob Herring;
* Removed spin lock from Spreadtrum's gate, mux, div drivers, since we have
  switched to use regmap.

Changes from V3: (https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/2/61)
* Addressed comments from Julien Thierry:
  - Clean the if branch of sprd_mux_helper_get_parent()
  - Have the Gate clock macros and ops for both mode (i.e. sc_gate and gate) separate;
  - Have the Mux clock macros with/without table separate, and same changes
    for the composite clock.
* Switched the function name from _endisable to _toggle;
* Fixed Kbuild test error:
  - Added exporting sprd_clk_regmap_init() which would be used in other module(s);
* Change the function sprd_clk_set_regmap() to the static one, and removed the
  declear from the include file;
* Addressed comments from Rob:
  - Separate the dt-binding include file from the driver patch;
  - Documented more for the property "clocks"
* Changed the syscon device names;
* Changed the name of 'sprd_mux_internal' to 'sprd_mux_ssel'
  

Changes from V2: (http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1707.1/01504.html)
* Switch to use regmap to access registers;
* Splited all clocks into 16 separated nodes, for each belongs to a single address area; 
* Rearranged the order of clock declaration in sc9860-clk.c, sorted them upon the address area;
* Added syscon device tree nodes which will be quoted by the node of clocks which are in
  the same address area with the syscon device;
* Revised the binding documentation according to the dt modification. 

Changes from V1: (https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/6/17/356)
* Address Stephen's comments:
  - Switch to use platform device driver instead of the DT probing mechanism.
  - Move the common clock macro out from vendor directory, but need to remove those
    overlap code from other vendors (such as sunxi-ng) once this get merged.
  - Add support to be built as a module.
  - Add 'sprd_' prefix for all spin locks used in these drivers.
  - Mark input parameter of sprd_x with const.
  - Remove unreasonable dependencies to CONFIG_64BIT.
  - Add readl() after writing the same register.
  - Remove CLK_IS_BASIC which is no longer used.
  - Remove unnecessery CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED when defining a clock.
  - Change to expose all clock index.
  - Use clk_ instead of ccu.
  - Add Kconfig for sprd clocks.
  - Move the fixed clocks out from the soc node.
  - Switch to use 64-bit math in pll driver instead of 32-bit math.
* Revise binding documentation according to dt modification.
* Rename sc9860.c to sc9860-clk.c
