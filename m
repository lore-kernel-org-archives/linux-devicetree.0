MCP16502 is a Power Management IC from Microchip.
It has 4 Buck outputs and 2 LDOs. The buck regulators
can be used in two modes: normal(FPWM) and low-power(Auto PFM).

This patch series adds support for the MCP16502 PMIC.

v3:
- use CONFIG_SUSPEND and CONFIG_PM to fix compile errors for some configs

v2:
- use lpm-gpios instead of lpm-gpio in devicetree bindings documentation
- describe the regulators present on the PMIC in the devicetree bindings
  documentation
- add SPDX license inside a C++ comment
- prefix macro
- remove mcp16502_update_regulator and mcp16502_read
- replace ?: with if-else
- change some if-else with switch statements for legibility
- use regmap helpers for regultor settings during runtime
- make mcp16502_get_status read the status from the PMIC STS registers
- use module_i2c_driver
- use the PMIC's Hibernate registers for suspend-to-mem, the PMIC's
  Low-power registers for standby and the PMIC's Active registers for
  normal runtime

Note about mcp16502_suspend:
- mcp16502_gpio_set_mode(mcp, MCP16502_OPMODE_HIB) has now been changed to
  mcp16502_gpio_set_mode(mcp, MCP16502_OPMODE_LPM) for legibility.

Note that the function call only sets the LPM pin of the PMIC to high.
This puts the PMIC in Low-power operating mode. Hibernate operating mode
is reached when the MPU sets the PWRHLD line to zero (typically when
entering suspend-to-ram).
