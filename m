Handling that is easy, just add a i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match to
both busses (with separate child nodes to be probed under each bus),
the on one bus the probe-code will just read the end of the list
and stop, I believe we should not treat that as an error anyways
(even if there is only 1 bus).

Ah, no I meant dealing with this in the actual device driver,
not in some special intermediate driver, just like the actual x86
device drivers (sometimes) apply quirks based on board DMI strings.
