If you were to do that, that would cover the entire clock-controller,
not necessarily for the individual clock line (as this does not
necessarily have a node of its own). So you'd prevent the use of other
clocks owned by that controller.

That's also not sufficient, as you'd have to do the same for resources
required to keep that clock active (parent clocks from different
controllers, regulators, GPIOs, etc).

I don't think that will work other than in very basic cases.

Thanks,
Mark.
