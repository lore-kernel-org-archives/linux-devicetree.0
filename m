What I don't like is precisely that you need to expose this 'struct ops' to the
consumer. I would prefer an API for this (it can be a 1:1 mapping). The canvas
should remain some abstract object you get from DT.

IMO, this is the same as a reset, a syscon or whatever other phandle you get
from DT. The consumer should not have to 'care' how it works (how data are
organized), it should just use it.

Whatever you need to do to deal with your canvas phandle should (IMO) reside in
your soc/amlogic/meson-canvas.c, and not be spread in the consumers.

This is why we have a DT documentation.

And, as far as I understand amlogic's display and decoder stuff, you won't get
very far w/o a canvas, so 'the developer' will be reminded fairly quickly ;)

It's just my opinion, I'm not the one merging it ... :P
