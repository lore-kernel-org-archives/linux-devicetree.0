That is a valid concern in my view.

When we were reworking the handling of wakeup interrupts during the 3.18
cycle, one of my proposals was to move the "suspended" irqactions to an
"inactive" list during suspend_device_irqs() and back during
resume_device_irqs(), but Thomas didn't like that approach.  His main
argument was that it made the code in question overly complex which
was fair enough to me.

What about adding a new flag like I said?
