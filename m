Following set of patches add initial DT support for PMIC devices
found on recent Quqalcomm chipsets. Details for SPMI bus and PMIC arbiter
could be found here [1]. First version of the patches could be found here [2].

Changes since first version.

* Added more specific compatible strings to PMIC's DT configuration nodes.
* Changed #size-cells of the PMIC's DT configuration nodes from 0 to 1.
  #size-cells property is used by drivers to obtain size of the resource regions.
* Added Reviewed-by from Bjorn and Andy. Hopefully it still stands after these
  changes.

Regards,
Ivan
