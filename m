I do not entirely agree with the statements here, it does give big benefit
on our systems with MMIO. I am going to ask Mark to comment on this, he
know better and understands ARM.

I am probably going to be okay with this not using regmap and it is debug
but you should give that a try in future for better performance and ofcourse
you can add to regmap to get a better model for your device
