Hi!

v1 -> v2 changes
- add ack from Rob Herring on patch 1/2.
- add reasons why breaking compatibility is ok for patch 2/2 (requested
  by Rob).
- add #sound-dai-cells to the ssc0 node in the devcietree example.

The Atmel SSC is currently not usable as an audio DAI unless someone
registers it with ASoC. This is currently delegated to a platform
driver for every possible audio use, and prevents the SSC from being
used as a cpu DAI with the simple-audio-card driver.

The first patch fixes this.

The second patch simplifies one of these platform drivers, since it
can now rely on the SSC to register itself with ASoC. However, this
may not be a possible simplification for other, older, drivers since
it also requires device tree changes.

Cheers,
Peter
