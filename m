IIUC the last submission v4 of that patchset was in May
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.samsung-soc/31029
Do we have to wait for that to get upstream? Or maybe we could adopt
that binding now so it becomes trivial to convert to that when that
gets upstream?

Some devices like PCI, LLI need it and the S70-evb has half of its ram
above 4GB.
Maybe ARM_LPAE should be selected by inclusion of support for those?

CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE() directly takes smp_ops but here we use mcpm's
smp_ops which are statically defined. We have to call
mcpm_smp_set_ops() which does the real job.

Yes should be doable, unless I am overlooking some issue. Will try doing that.

I saw that coming :)
We need this driver as early as when timers are populated and then for
secondary CPU power control ... when we don't have any platform_device
to hook the data on. And I think it is ok because this is the 'server'
driver for the platform which by definition won't have another
instance.

The common mailbox framework passes around pointers to data packets.
Its completely between controller and client drivers to decide the
format of the packet. In my case the packet is a simple u32 value.

We can do that for completeness but otherwise my platform is as good
as dead if the remote doesn't reply for some reason. And there is no
fool-proof way to recover the state-machine from a failed
communication.

This and others, are data packets that are passed between local and
remote via SharedMemory. __packed is only meant to specify that these
data structures have no holes in them.
