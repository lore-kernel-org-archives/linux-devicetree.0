I found a list of versions under "Downloads and Documentation", but
unfortunately the actual downloads are not accessible without a
customer account.

Multiple compatible strings.

"hisilicon,dwc-sata-phy" would be too generic anyway, it should include the
name of the chip that first implements this, or the exact version of the
IP block, preferably both.

Ideally if you can find out the version that hisilicon uses, it could
look something like

compatible = "hisilicon,hi15hd2-sata-phy", "snps,dwc-sata-phy-2.3a", ""snps,dwc-sata-phy";

Note also the specific version of the hisilicon chip: you must not use
wildcards in compatible strings but should always use a real product number.
("1" instead of "x"). If multiple chips are mutually compatible, they
can all use the number of the first one here.
