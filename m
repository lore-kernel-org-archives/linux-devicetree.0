I agree. If there are run time check required in code to treat the 
variants of Keystone SoC differently, then this change is needed. At 
this time, SoC DTS captures these differences. IMHO, If a future 
Keystone SoC support required SoC specific compatibility string to 
customize SoC specific initialization code, then it can be introduced at 
that time. I am not sure why this is introduced with out an example usage.
