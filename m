So, I'm not seeing *any* interest here from any other HDMI users.  This
is a continuing theme with HDMI patches and is really very concerning,
everyone appears to be working in their own bubbles coming up with their
own things and ignoring everyone else's work - what little review I'm
seeing seems to be happening only after I explicitly prompt it.  I'm
following up to Jean-Francois' patches here but this isn't specific to
them, it seems like a general thing with HDMI code.

This in turn makes me think there's some abstraction problems with
what's going on and we're going to have to go through yet more
refactorings to fix things up as we do manage to come up with better
abstractions.  What I'd really like to see as a bare minimum is some
visible conversation about what we're doing and sign that people are
at least keeping in mind generic solutions when working on HDMI code.
Some commentary on the similarities and differences between hardware
and which abstractions work with which devices would also be really
helpful in working out if we're going in the right direction.

Basically at the minute I'm worried that we may be making the problems
we've got here worse not better, I've not personally had the time to sit
down and study the hardware sufficiently to form a firm impression
myself which isn't helping.
