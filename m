Oops, right.  c5_soc_devkit_c.

I guess I got confused since your regulator name in the dts was "HPS
3.3V".  When I saw "3.3V_PM_HPS" I assumed it was the same.

On <http://www.rocketboards.org/pub/Documentation/AlteraSoCDevelopmentBoard/c5_soc_devkit_c.pdf?t=1365712679>
I don't see a 3885.  Oh, 3855.  I see.

Yes, that's my opinion.  Matching the schematics can be a huge benefit
and can avoid confusion!  :)
