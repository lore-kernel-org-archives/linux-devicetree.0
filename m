Thanks a lot for Vincent Guittot careful work to find bug for 'CPU_NAP'
idle state. From ftrace log we can observe CA73 CPUs can be easily waken
up from 'CPU_NAP' state but the 'waken up' CPUs doesn't handle anything
and sleep again; so there have tons of trace events for CA73 CPUs
entering and exiting idle state.

On Hi3660 CA73 has retention state 'CPU_NAP' for CPU idle, this state we
set its psci parameter as '0x0000001' and from this parameter it can
calculate state id is 1. Unfortunately ARM trusted firmware (ARM-TF)
takes 1 as a invalid value for state id, so the CPU cannot enter idle
state and directly bail out to kernel.

This commit changes psci parameter to '0x00000000' for state id = 0;
this id is accepted by ARM trusted firmware and finally CPU can stay
properly in 'CPU_NAP' state.
