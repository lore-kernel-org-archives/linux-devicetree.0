No problem! Apologies accepted ;)

Yes. This is the case of the STi SoCs.
When resuming from system sleep, the clocks-related registers are 
restored at their boot state.

 From a functional point of view, that would indeed resolve the PM 
related issue.
But I'm not sure that on a performance point of view, parsing the DT at 
each driver's resume call is an efficient way.

Yes, that's another case to handle.
I don't know which platforms are in that case, but not STi SoCs for your 
information.

OK, I agree with the approach.
There is still the PM issue remaining with these clocks, but I think 
that is not related to your series as we already have the issue currently.

Thanks,
