Hi Mark, thanks for the continued feedback, please see below...

Well it's doing something which is making sure the nobody passes in a
sample size that's not supported. Wouldn't we want to catch this?

The overlong line goes through checkpatch --strict and looks like an
accepted practice to prevent breaking "grep" for example. The text is
more or less from the datasheet to give people something they can
cross-associate. But I can try to short this a bit.

You made a good point with the dev_crit(), I can certainly promote this
over current condition.  It happens for example if I drive too big of a
load (a heavy-duty jumper wire in my case, simulating a short of the
output stage).  If so, we should also consider the other two fault
conditions.  For the "over temp" error condition (which is actually
really hard to create on the bench, I've to get the EVM up to like 150C
and things start smelling a bit) this should probably be dev_crit() as
well. And then, maybe leave the "DC error" as a warning, since it's less
critical than the other two conditions. Thoughts?

Regards,
Andreas
