Ok, so I've spend some time debugging this, and the problem is not the
disabling of the NMI in the NMI controller itself. The problem is that
the irq line used in the sun6i-a31.dtsi is wrong, irq 0 is for uart0
the nmi uses irq 32. So this fixes this hang due to unhandled irqs
I've been seeing:

Note I also remove the interrupt-parent as the gic is the
default interrupt-parent, and we don't explicitly set that
anywhere else either.

Besides that after having looked into this more, I strongly
believe that we should disable the NMI before registering the
irq handler, as registering the irq handler unmasks the irq
on the gic, so if u-boot has left the NMI enabled, and the NMI pin
is active we will immediately get an interrupt, before any
driver has claimed the downstream interrupt of the NMI.

IOW I strongly believe we should do this:

So it looks like we need a v8, sorry for not spotting this sooner.
