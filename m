Do you just want a backup plan in case we don't make a platform
device out of the cpus node? I believe we can always add code
somewhere to create a platform device at runtime if we detect the
cpus node has a compatible string equal to "qcom,krait". We could
probably change this driver's module_init() to scan the DT for
such a compatible string and create the platform device right
there. If we get more than one interrupt in the cpus node we can
add interrupt-names and then have software look for interrupts by
name instead of number.
