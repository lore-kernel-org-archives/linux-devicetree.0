Would probing the display earlier solve this as that's also something
people care about (or work-around by initializing the display in the
bootloader). I guess if the display depends on resources A, B, and C,
other drivers could still each only depend on one of those and probe
successfully before the display does. However, the display driver
would still probe, so you could do something then to enable the
constraints. That would have the advantage that the driver knows what
resources it needs even if probe is deferred and you don't need
special DT bindings nor platform code.

Getting certain drivers/devices to probe first may just require
ensuring they get inserted at the beginning of the driver and device
lists which would be a pretty trivial change I think. That's ignoring
differing initcall levels though.

Continuing the above thought, we could just match device nodes against
stdout-path as we create devices and then set a priority flag or
something that the driver core would handle.

Yes, it's triggered by a specific use case, but I'm not that convinced
that having things setup by the bootloader and needing a transparent
hand off is a general case. You've given 2 examples. I can't think of
many more. One is CAN bus which has realtime servicing requirements,
but I don't think this series solves that (OOT solutions I've seen
insert callbacks at random places during kernel init). The other case
is just things that have no driver at all, but resources need to
remain enabled. That should just be some platform code to enable those
things IMO.

This is only if the driver (or dependent driver) is a module though.
Is that something we really need to handle?

earlycon really. earlycon doesn't have to be a serial device.

Kind of a mixture of boards and subsystem handlers. Perhaps subsystem
handlers should go into the subsystems. Then you can get a lot more
opinions on this. :)
