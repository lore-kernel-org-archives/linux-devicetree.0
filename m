I had the same idea a while back and something Grant Likely and I
talked about at ELC-E 2017 in Prague.  This is the way I would prefer
to move forward on this.

Not sure that can be done.  The only way to do that would be to
continue using the reg property, which isn't possible anymore.  As
such said DT wouldn't be upstream and I'm not sure we need to care
about those.

You have a point.  The code could check for both reg and hwid
properties.  If both are there hwid is preferred.  Otherwise the reg
property is used.  That wouldn't be too difficult to implement and
avoid introducing a regression.  Of course all this is fantasy until
we actually try things out.
