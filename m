I guess I/we need to have a closer look at how these are actually shared
and decide if there are really overlapping users.  here are several
different registers packed into this region, but it may be the case that
there really isn't any overlapping usage (e.g. pinmux vs. PHY vs bus
priorities, etc.)

Even better.
