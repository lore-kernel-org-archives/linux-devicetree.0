So it's (partly) a platform/bus issue.

What kind of clocks are these? What do they control?
Memory controllers? Bus controllers?

They must control some device(s), so there should be one or more device
nodes in DT that reference these clocks.
As soon as that information is in DT, support can be added to Linux to
make sure the "critical" clocks stay enabled, either through a real driver,
or through platform code.

Rob already provided a pointer.
If you have more questions, feel free to ask!
