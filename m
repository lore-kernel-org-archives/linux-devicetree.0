BTW, it's not very not clear what the change from v2 was. In the
future, please include a change log in each patch. Also, Arnd acked
v2, so you should add those when posting a new version unless there's
major changes, but don't post new versions just to add the
acks/reviewed-bys. It doesn't really matter in this case as you are
the maintainer and have to collect them, but generally the maintainers
only collect acks on the version they apply and don't go looking at
prior versions.
