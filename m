Yes, but I thought the board ID is never utilized. However, I have not
tested that.

You are right. That might be a problem. Someone might want to use the
pins for another functionality. I personally think the I2S
functionality will be the most used functionality for those pins, but
I accept it when you say that they better should be set as second I2C
channel and generic GPIO pins (as it is by default).

However, for an end user it doesn't seem to be a convenient solution
to have a kernel tree for each possible combination of pin
assignments.
The "old way" would be to set the pin functionality while loading the
i2s driver, but I assume that is not the right way to go, right?
