Well, why is it inferior in the first place?  It represents the same information
and I'm not sure why the binary formats matter here?

If I'm to create a _DSD with that information and have a DT template, it
surely is easier to copy it exactly than to figure out how to resolve it
to represent something I can actually put in there.
