With !LPAE, no devices are coherent, so that should work with both
SMP and and UP. Not sure about LPAE with coherent devices on UP,
IIRC we had a bug in that configuration on Armada XP, as the memory
was not marked as sharable at all there, and ended up not being
coherent with DMA masters.

My first guess is that uniprocessor mode on keystone has not been
tested at all (TI's QA seems to test only a very limited number of
configurations), so it may or may not work.
