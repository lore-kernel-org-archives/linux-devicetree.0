Hi All,

this patch series is an extension of the initial patch delivery for the
Itead Ibox as found here
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/linux-sunxi/GR_co3ObW8s/0BTPQljmAAAJ.

There seems to be a few Itead variants out there based on their A10/A20
core module and this patch series attempts to organise the device tree
files with some consideration that these variants may be added later.

I've also converted the A10 Itead Iteaduino dts to use this common file.
As I don't have this board to verify the changes I simply compared the
output of the fdtdump before and after applying these patches. The only
difference was the reduction to the dcdc2 max voltage.

BR,
CK

Changes since v3:
- Removed spi0 from Itead Ibox dts.
- Removed unneccessary header references.
- Removed Itead A10/A20 Core dtsi, moving what SoC specific parts to the
  board dts and generic parts to the common dtsi.
- fixed naming delimiters in compatibles.

Changes since v2:
- removed duplicate naming
- moved enabling of some peripherals to board level.

Changes since v1:
- Added audio codec.
- Seperated into individual patches
- added Itead A10 core dtsi
- modified sun4i-a10-itead-iteaduino-plus.dts to use itead common core dtsii
