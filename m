We have to keep both clk system working for at91 platform (new CCF based
clk implementations and old clk implementations) for two reasons:
1) the new clk implemetations are only compatible with DT enabled boards
     and some at91 boards are not yet ported to DT.
2) we decided to move to the new clk implementations in multiple steps 
(one SoC
     family after another) in order to ease PATCH review.

If we change the drivers to avoid specific clock name request 
([devm]_clk_get(dev, NULL)),
we will have to change the old static clk lookup tables
(i.e. 
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/arm/mach-at91/at91sam9g45.c#L226,
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/arm/mach-at91/at91sam9260.c#L202, 
...).

Best Regards,

Boris
