All we need is a regmap for the kpss-gcc, but the restriction that it has to be 
a syscon is more of a implementation detail. But you probably don't want to 
implement the phandle->regmap lookup code in kpss-gcc (and all the other
places) and if I understand the syscon improvements being suggested they are
supposed to help with exactly that (help any device expose regmaps).

Need to look into that again though.

Hmm, seems I got that wrong, sorry about that.

But do you mean "all wrong" as in that I use the wrong bit or to some greater
extent? Currently all following requests should timeout, but maybe we should
have a faster fail-path when we've hit this point?
