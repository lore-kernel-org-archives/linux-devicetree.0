But with that, i need multiple DT_MACHINE_START(). Isn't it?
Is this advisable?

DT should be up but, nodes would be up only once we call
of_platform_populate() from this init routine. And i had following code in
my patch:

static void __init spear3xx_dt_init(void)
{
...
	if (of_machine_is_compatible("st,spear300"))
		of_platform_populate(NULL, of_default_bus_match_table,
				spear300_auxdata_lookup, NULL);
	else if (of_machine_is_compatible("st,spear310"))
		of_platform_populate(NULL, of_default_bus_match_table,
				spear310_auxdata_lookup, NULL);
	else if (of_machine_is_compatible("st,spear320"))
		of_platform_populate(NULL, of_default_bus_match_table,
				spear320_auxdata_lookup, NULL);

...
}

And so these checks are not working here. :(

Actually we can't do it. :(
If i boot 300 then i will also get clocks of 310 and 320 in my clock list.
And once i go through this clock list to create clock tree (parent-child
relationship), i will try to access hardware registers of 310 & 320,
which are just not valid for 300. Kernel Crash!!
