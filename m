I have a Cubieboard and I have a pca9532 on my desk. Now I want to
attach this pca9532 to the Cubieboard so I wire them together on I2C.

How is the Allwinner kernel going to load the driver for the pca9532?
The mainline pca9532 driver does not understand fex so it can't read
the necessary initialization data.

Luke, you of all people should see what is going on. Take an EOMA
module based on an A10. Now plug it into ten different hosts with
widely varying hardware support - like each of the ten hosts has a
different lm-sensor type chip. Where are the fex drivers for those ten
different lm-sensor chips going to come from? We already have DT
support for them.

fex is only supported on the small number of peripheral chips
Allwinner has blessed. Use any chip outside of that set and it isn't
going to boot.
