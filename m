No I do not believe there are users of this, other than the AMD board which
doesn't use these bindings. Actually given they're the same bindings, albei=
t
with a different number of cells, I've tested the code with just 1 cell and
1 clock in the DTS and this still works as before so the driver should be
backwards compatible.
