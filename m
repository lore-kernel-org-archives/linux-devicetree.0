The issue is actually worse than that:

- drivers that are already componentised can't use bridges
- drivers that use bridges can't use componentised stuff

because bridges don't register themselves with the component helper,
and the helpers in drm_of.c assume that all graph nodes will be
components.

The whole thing about whether stuff is componentised or bridge based
is really getting out of hand, and the push is towards bridge based
stuff even though that is technically inferior when it comes to being
able to develop and test (which involves being able to remove and
re-insert modules.)

Consequently more and more code is being written for bridges, and
the component helper ignored, and the problems with bridges are
being ignored.  This is not healthy.

The problem is only going to get worse.  Someone needs to bite the
bullet and fix bridges before the problem gets any more out of hand.
