Ok, I looked at the code now and it seems that the generic phy layer
returns -EINVAL for a phy reference to an invalid node, but not a
reference to a valid node without a driver, here it returns
-EPROBE_DEFER, which by itself is reasonable behavior.

In this case, the NOP_USB_XCEIV driver is using the old usb-phy
framework, and the dwc2 driver tries both but bails out when the
generic phy returns -EPROBE_DEFER.

It sounds like the problem is not limited to raspberry pi then, but
the same thing would happen on any other machine using the
same algorithm. I looked at the other USB drivers that support
both generic-phy and usb-phy drivers:

- the generic usb-hcd code (usb_add_hcd) tries usb-phy first
  and then tries generic-phy, but appears to also return
  with -EPROBE_DEFER if either of the two asks for deferral.
  other return codes are ignored.
- dwc2 (as show above) tries generic-phy first, propagates
  -EPROBE_DEFER before trying usb-phy.
- dwc3 tries usb-phy first, and propagates -EPROBE_DEFER
  from generic-phy even if usb-phy had succeeded.

- chipidea tries both and uses whichever one works, returning
  -EPROBE_DEFER as long as both fail.
- musb/da8xx_probe propagates any error from generic-phy including
  -EPROBE_DEFER, it then registers a generic phy and uses
  that internally.
- musb/musb_dsps tries both, it fails if usb-phy is not working, but
  ignores errors from generic-phy
- musb/omap2430 needs both usb-phy and generic-phy
- musb/sunxi needs a generic-phy and then registers a usb-phy
- renesas_usbhs tries both if they are enabled and fails
  if one of them returns any error.

It's hard to tell what exactly is affected by the usb-hcd change,
most importantly since this is configuration dependent: if
the generic-phy layer is disabled, nothing changes, but otherwise
it would be broken the same way as dwc2 and dwc3.

The best idea I have so far is to had a hack into the generic
phy code with a full list of compatible strings that the must
never return -EPROBE_DEFER because that would break
the usb-phy handling:
