-* ARM architected timer
-
-ARM cores may have a per-core architected timer, which provides per-cpu timers,
-or a memory mapped architected timer, which provides up to 8 frames with a
-physical and optional virtual timer per frame.
-
-The per-core architected timer is attached to a GIC to deliver its
-per-processor interrupts via PPIs. The memory mapped timer is attached to a GIC
-to deliver its interrupts via SPIs.
-
-** CP15 Timer node properties:
-
-- compatible : Should at least contain one of
-	"arm,armv7-timer"
-	"arm,armv8-timer"
-
-- interrupts : Interrupt list for secure, non-secure, virtual and
-  hypervisor timers, in that order.
-
-- clock-frequency : The frequency of the main counter, in Hz. Should be present
-  only where necessary to work around broken firmware which does not configure
-  CNTFRQ on all CPUs to a uniform correct value. Use of this property is
-  strongly discouraged; fix your firmware unless absolutely impossible.
-
-- always-on : a boolean property. If present, the timer is powered through an
-  always-on power domain, therefore it never loses context.
-
-- fsl,erratum-a008585 : A boolean property. Indicates the presence of
-  QorIQ erratum A-008585, which says that reading the counter is
-  unreliable unless the same value is returned by back-to-back reads.
-  This also affects writes to the tval register, due to the implicit
-  counter read.
-
-- hisilicon,erratum-161010101 : A boolean property. Indicates the
-  presence of Hisilicon erratum 161010101, which says that reading the
-  counters is unreliable in some cases, and reads may return a value 32
-  beyond the correct value. This also affects writes to the tval
-  registers, due to the implicit counter read.
-
-** Optional properties:
-
-- arm,cpu-registers-not-fw-configured : Firmware does not initialize
-  any of the generic timer CPU registers, which contain their
-  architecturally-defined reset values. Only supported for 32-bit
-  systems which follow the ARMv7 architected reset values.
-
-- arm,no-tick-in-suspend : The main counter does not tick when the system is in
-  low-power system suspend on some SoCs. This behavior does not match the
-  Architecture Reference Manual's specification that the system counter "must
-  be implemented in an always-on power domain."
-
-
-Example:
-
-	timer {
-		compatible = "arm,cortex-a15-timer",
-			     "arm,armv7-timer";
-		interrupts = <1 13 0xf08>,
-			     <1 14 0xf08>,
-			     <1 11 0xf08>,
-			     <1 10 0xf08>;
-		clock-frequency = <100000000>;
-	};
-
-** Memory mapped timer node properties:
-
-- compatible : Should at least contain "arm,armv7-timer-mem".
-
-- clock-frequency : The frequency of the main counter, in Hz. Should be present
-  only when firmware has not configured the MMIO CNTFRQ registers.
-
-- reg : The control frame base address.
-
-Note that #address-cells, #size-cells, and ranges shall be present to ensure
-the CPU can address a frame's registers.
-
-A timer node has up to 8 frame sub-nodes, each with the following properties:
-
-- frame-number: 0 to 7.
-
-- interrupts : Interrupt list for physical and virtual timers in that order.
-  The virtual timer interrupt is optional.
-
-- reg : The first and second view base addresses in that order. The second view
-  base address is optional.
-
-- status : "disabled" indicates the frame is not available for use. Optional.
-
-Example:
-
-	timer@f0000000 {
-		compatible = "arm,armv7-timer-mem";
-		#address-cells = <1>;
-		#size-cells = <1>;
-		ranges;
-		reg = <0xf0000000 0x1000>;
-		clock-frequency = <50000000>;
-
-		frame@f0001000 {
-			frame-number = <0>
-			interrupts = <0 13 0x8>,
-				     <0 14 0x8>;
-			reg = <0xf0001000 0x1000>,
-			      <0xf0002000 0x1000>;
-		};
-
-		frame@f0003000 {
-			frame-number = <1>
-			interrupts = <0 15 0x8>;
-			reg = <0xf0003000 0x1000>;
-		};
-	};
