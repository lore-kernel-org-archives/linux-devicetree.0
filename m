We're using DVI, but it turns out that the interrupt signal on the video encoder (TFP410) is not connected to anything on our board, so I can't receive any interrupts.  The only way I would be able to tell is to create a kernel timer to poll the TFP410 through I2C, which I really don't want to do.

My board supports both LVDS and DVI, and the LVDS is connected to a built-in display, so I need to support both hotplug and non-hotplug.

I also noticed that the I2C interface is not enabled until after the console opens the framebuffer.  That means it's impossible for EDID data to be available before the console switches to the video device.  That doesn't seem right.
