It was my v1 patch did.

I send the v2 patch due to below reasons,
There are other PLL3 users, it is better keep refcount
to all its children, or the user will be confused when the
PLL3 goes to disable, but the usb otg part is still used

For PLL7, we can do it, and let the PLL7 be out of clock framework
management.

But I still think keep usbphy as PLL child is better solution,
in that case, the clock maintainer can know the real clock usage.
