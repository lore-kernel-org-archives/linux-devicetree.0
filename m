Thanks for the feedback!

I experimented initially with changing channels_max, but overwriting
dmic_dai.capture.channels_max didn't seem right since it would affect
other possible instances of the codec. I overlooked that this can be
avoided by passing a *copy* with adjusted channels_max to
snd_soc_register_codec().
