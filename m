It was, the 'u' comes from 'u'nderstanding the coverletter _and_ the
code. ;-)

One a side note, I should mention I find your detailed coverletters
extremely helpful for getting up to speed quickly on what the intention
of a series is.  Even better, the Link tag that's added to the commit
message allows future devs to be three clicks away from that
information.  Thanks for setting that standard.

Which makes me think, in a lot of cases, it's better to start at the top
of the thread when researching a patch.  The Message-Id of the
coverletter is always the first address in the References header.
Perhaps I should link to that instead, or add both.

Yep.

Dunno.  I have a 100% failure rate getting Russell to create a stable
topic branch to resolve dependencies like these.  Unfortunately, I think
the answer is going to be resubmit 3/3 once 3.16-rc1 lands with 1/3 and
2/3.

Not the answer I want to give, but unfortunately, it's the most
realistic.

thx,

Jason.
