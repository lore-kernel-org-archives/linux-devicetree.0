Hi Sebastian

There have been some comments about properties with Boolean
values. Rather than having a Boolean, you simply don't list the
property.

What you have here is slightly different, since you have
set/clear/don't touch. How to represent this should be decided once by
the DT folks, and used consistently in all bindings.
