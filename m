Dumb buffers are really just a very thin in-kernel abstraction for boot
splash screens. As soon as you have real userspace (surfaceflinger, gl es,
whatever) the idea is that an allocator in userspace (like gralloc, gbm or
similar) figures out the allocation constraints and where to allocate
things exactly. Maybe that includes allocating from dumb buffers with
special knowledge (by increasing x/y perhaps), but most likely that means
you either allocate from your proprietary/out-of-tree gpu render driver or
some other central allocator like ion.

Anyway, adding hacks to the dumb buffer which are meant to facilite
sharing with other devices, or using it for anything else than a boot
splash is a no-go. DRM has made the design decision that gpu rendering is
too vendor-specific at the kernel level to make such generic interfaces
possible, and that allocation problems can only be solved properly in
userspace.

For your case specifically first step is to get an open-source mali driver
released, since that the basic requirement for upstream drm to design new
solutions in any area. Hence why I mentioned that ;-)

Kernel modesetting drivers don't need that since for those we have a
well-defined ABI and already existing userspace like X or Wayland which
can use it.
