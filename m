OK. How about ?
  #define MBOX_BASE(m, n)   ((m)->base + (n) * 4)
  void __iomem *base = MBOX_BASE(mdev, instance);

IIU what you mean... can't that still happen because of the  _relaxed()?
Anyways my point was about set/clr type regs. And you may look at if
channel really needs disabling while interrupts are handled? I think
it shouldn't because either it is going to be a to-fro communication
or random broadcasts without any guarantee of reception. But of course
you would know better your platform.
BTW  sti_mbox_channel_is_enabled() also needs to have locking around
enabled[] if you want to keep it.  And maybe embed sti_mbox_chan_lock
inside sti_mbox_device.

Not anymore, after the clarification that we don't need a 'break' statement.

cheers.
