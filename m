a) See
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/devicetree/usage-model.txt#n116
-> all we have today is board, soc generic family. The generic
compatible flag of ti,keystone to mark that this is a keystone2 device
does not identify that what kind of soc it is. which is what this
series introduces.

b) there is no realistic way for user space applications such as a
test framework or other SoC based applications in a generic distro to
detect the right SoC this platform is running on - imagine writing SoC
specific code that depends on board compatible flags - there is never
an end to that story as the number of boards expand.

c) Ideally we will try never to introduce code that will have to
depend on SoC compatible flag based match in kernel - but that is not
a reason not to follow guidelines provided by devicetree documentation
to provide SoC specific compatible flags.
