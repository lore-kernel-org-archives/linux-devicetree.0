This has been a big problem in our communication. You start with
"exactly same..." and go on telling the difference.
And that difference is important.

In MHU the 32bits are tied together and all go to one target
processor. Whereas on QCom, each bit corresponds to independent signal
going to a different target processor.

IOW, QCom has 32 channels per register whereas MHU has one. The
current drivers reflect that reality and hence I am against any change
in MHU driver.  Not to mean even changing the MHU driver will fix the
core issue - which is https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/7/7/465 and this
patchset tries to address that.
