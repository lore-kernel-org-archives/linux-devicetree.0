Is there any plan to change the way this works for future versions of RPMh?

Mark: I'm leaving this firmly in your hands.  I can see David's points
here.  I could even believe that some of this stuff could be board
specific where one board might have slightly different capacitors or
they might be placed differently and might need a higher power mode to
keep the signal clean.
