Right, the endpoint numbering certainly *can* be important for some cases,
I can see that, and am not arguing against that part...

That would regress cases where two (or more) endpoints are enabled
(which is currently supported). As I see it, the driver will have a
very hard time knowing when to stop iterating with any solution not
involving the equivalent of the functions for_each_endpoint_of_node
and of_graph_parse_endpoint. Open-coding of_graph_parse_endpoint just
to avoid it is a bit more than silly IMHO...
