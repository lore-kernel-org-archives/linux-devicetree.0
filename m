Hello,

This fourth patch series is rebased on top of shawn's for-next branch
and tested on Colibri Vybrid VF50 and VF61 modules.

This patchset implements SoC bus support for Freescale Vybrid platform,
implementing the following
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-devices-soc

This a reworked version of an older patchset series posted in June 2015
which was at v5 then [1]. Since the NVMEM framework was then getting
introduced, we decided that first a NVMEM driver for OCOTP peripheral
being in place would be better.

Compared to the older revisions, this driver now relies on NVMEM
consumer API using the NVMEM based vf610_ocotp driver which has
already been in mainline for a while now.

One point on which we were not sure here is whether we really should
introduce a new Kconfig symbol as being introduced here. While we
could just enable it when SOC_VF610 is selected, this however would
introduce circular dependencies.

Feedback is most welcome.

@Rob Herring
Does this patchset address the concerns you had? The only change
to the device tree is now for the compatible property.

@Srinivas
Is this new NVMEM consumer API acceptable? Would you recommend a
different approach?

Changes since v3:
1. Use just a compatible node at the SoC node and do not
use a separate node for the binding
2. Use syscon regmap lookup for getting information from
MSCM and OCROM nodes.
3. Introduce a NVMEM consumer API for getting a NVMEM cell
given a device node containing that cell.
4. Do not introduce any node at the SoC level.

Changes since v2:
1. Remove syscon_regmap_read_from_offset function and use the
available syscon functions
2. Remove fsl,vf610-soc-bus and related bindings at SoC node
level and introduce a fsl,vf610-soc node which is used by the
driver to bind and has all the required phandles plus the NVMEM
consumer handles.
3. Fix memory leak. of_node_put was not called for returned node
of of_parse_phandle and memory allocated by nvmem_cell_read was
not freed explicitly in return error paths.

Changes since v1:
Add device tree binding documentation.
