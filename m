Now the audio bindings have their own binding document update the main
MFD document to point to that file and remove the audio binding
documentation.

-    (eg. First entry in the list corresponds to output 1). A non-zero value
-    indicates a mono output. If present, the number of values should be less

-    should be handled normally.
-    If present, number of cells must be less than or equal to the number of

-  - wlf,spk-fmt : PDM speaker data format, must contain 2 cells (OUT5 and OUT6).
-    See the datasheet for values.
-    The second cell is ignored for codecs that do not have OUT6 (wm5102, wm8997,
