They look like they were either independently written or diverged a long 
time ago. The existing kernel DTs describe hardware absent from the ARM 
TF ones and vice versa.

With specific reference to PSCI it looks like my patches could perhaps 
be improved by adding idle-state support.

The general problem is copying from where?

The kernel DTs are a well maintained centralized repository which is 
*really* useful. git grep across the kernel DTs is a hugely powerful 
tool when trying to better understand an ecosystem as sprawling and 
diverse as ARMs. In fact I've even seen those sort of searchs used as a 
basis to clean up unused code. Seeing that centralized repository 
splinter into separate per-vendor silos would be a huge loss for kernel 
developers.

I kind of agree that maintaining DTs and DT documentation in the kernel 
is a little odd given that the kernel is not the only player here 
(FreeBSD, u-boot, etc). However it is sufficiently well maintained that 
projects are content(ish) to regard the kernel as the canonical source 
for these things (u-boot, for example, seeks to shadow kernel DTs 
without modifying them).

However regardless of the above I'd say they should be removed from ARM 
TF. ARM TF does not use, modify, pass on or in any way consume DT... it 
has no skin in the game here. Why does it want to own a few of blobs for 
a small subset of the platforms it supports? I'm afraid that makes no 
sense to me, to the extent that it didn't even occur to me to *look* in 
the ARM TF sources to find any DTs for FVP until you pointed them out.

In other words, whilst people could discuss alternative ways to manage 
DTs[1], I can't see any universe where ARM TF would be a logical place 
to keep them.

[1] ... and I'd further suggest that only perhaps people who are
     prepared to put resources into fixing it should convene such a
     discussion.
