We need check if the json-schema library supports this yet. I think it
should as there was an issue for it which is closed now.

We'll then need to update the meta-schema and maybe the schema fixups
to handle this case. We should have a test case in the library too.
Test cases are important given that if you get schemas wrong, the
result is silence.
