Thanks a bunch for the willingness to review this.

My apologies for not communicating this clearly enough -  Since it is
an pre-existing driver it is rather big.
I did not want to inflict a 600K patch on the mailing list so opted to
provide a git repo instead, as stated in the
email.

The patch in question is here:
https://github.com/gby/linux/commit/12d92e0bc19aa9bbd891cdab765eaaeabe0b6967

Do let me know if you prefer that I will send at least the smaller
patch file via email in the normal fashion.

Many thanks,
Gilad
