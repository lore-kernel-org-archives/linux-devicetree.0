I do leave it to platform maintainers judgement (perhaps that should
be reconsidered), but it should still be case by case basis not an all
out disregard for the ABI. If you decide to ignore the ABI, then there
is no decision for the distros or other users.

That is not really true. There are some differences ATM, but they are
largely derivatives of the kernel copy and the goal is to align them.
If we don't maintain an ABI, that will never happen.

Vendor ones we treat like vendor kernels. However, if the differences
come down to bikeshedding, then we will take vendor bindings to
maintain the ABI. That's generally only when the compatible string
differs though.
