Well, you both hit on something here. There's no possible self-policing
of what is submitted as bindings.

There's really no canonical documentation on best practices. Most
bindings are inconsistent in format and deprecated in style of
content.

I'm not talking about referring back to ePAPR or the explanation of
compatible string best practices on devicetree.org. I'm talking about
all the decisions made in random threads. The "standards" and "best
practices" have not been documented like our kernel patch submission
process and best practices. As a result, people our generating
additional traffic with every new binding submission. Stephen had
a nice list of best practices but it's difficult to tell if that is
agreed on by *all* the DT maintainers or his personal preference. At
some point we need to agree on documentation for best practices acked
by the entire maintainer team.
