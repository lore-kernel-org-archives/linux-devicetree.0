Yes certainly, this is another option (rather preferred one).

But to be consistent with other's I proposed this, please refer to the
fn device_800_init(), where all xxx_init() are taking 2 arguments, and
second argument is pdata.


There is room for cleanup, I agree.
I can put this too in the next cleanup series.
