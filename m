How is this going to work with dynamically instantiated hardware like DT
overlays?

As previously and repeatedly discussed DAIs have no special place in
a general audio system and we can't base the entire system off them.
Which DAI should have the headphone jack connected to the analogue only
headphone driver in my system (there may not even be a way to route
digital audio to it)?  How does this work for off-SoC audio hubs where
there is a device with multiple DAIs connected to both one or more other
digital devices and the analogue?

Please go and research this if you're intending to work on generic
bindings, it gets extremely repetitive to have to go over this again and
again.  We already have simple-card to provide a binding for trivial
systems and don't want to end up with a never ending series of slightly
more complicated bindings which each cover slightly different sets of
systems in ways that users struggle to differentiate between.

Similar things here - which of the two or more devices on a digital
audio link (yes, they're buses not point to point links) has the
configuration and how do we stitch them together?  How do we figure out
when and how to do runtime reconfiguration of the clock tree (which is
needed by some systems)?

Again, please do some research on this.  If you are trying to define
generic device tree bindings it is really important that you understand
what you are trying to model with those bindings.
