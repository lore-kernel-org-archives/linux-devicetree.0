Yes, that's the idea.

Ok, but who is responsible for such guarantee?
How is it enforced and verified?

Exactly, that's why to I'm having trouble to understand why there is so much
insistence on "getting the DT 100% right", since a HW change could imply
that what made 100% sense yesterday, does not today.
Since that is a possibility we have to live with, then the "100% right" goal
is most likely unachievable.
That's different from "backwards compatibility" for which some technique,
like alternate descriptions, can be put in place.

Maybe I will get a better understanding of this once my previous question
about who and how guarantees the stability of a given DT blob.

Could you be more precise on those two issues? Namely:
"the effort" and the "lack of benefit for the community"?

I can understand the effort it takes to review a binding and some
driver, but if there's no driver, why would it matter if the DT binding is
100% right? Hence, why would it take more effort?
Furthermore, if there's no driver, there's no backward compatibility to
guarantee. Shouldn't it require less effort?

Also, what sort of "benefits" does the community expects or requires?
Because the idea behind the proposal is to put the HW description in DT, so
basically the HW would be documented. Maybe there wouldn't be a driver right
away, but the HW description would allow for drivers to exist.

Ok, I'll try to come up with some example.

I see, although I don't understand how accepting such solution (i.e.: having the
information in a different DT) benefits the open-source community, since it
basically means that the open-source community settles for less information.
