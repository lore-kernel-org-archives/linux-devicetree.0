You might want to re-read the SBSA. Unless ARM provides an IP block or
there is some other standard such as EHCI or AHCI, there is no generic
implementation. You only have to go look at the Linux EHCI or AHCI
drivers and see how meaningless and inadequate "use EHCI" is. For PCI,
the text is so brief in the SBSA there will be no way PCI is going to
just work given all the variations of root complexes, bridges, address
windows, etc. we typically see on ARM platforms. I could be wrong and
some AML magic will solve all the problems. :)
