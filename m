As Tomeu says this struct device is the one created from scanning the
DT. There should never be more than one. Now some drivers create sub
devices and maybe they set the DT node on the child devices, but that
is wrong. Doing that would also break the current code:

struct platform_device *of_find_device_by_node(struct device_node *np)
{
        struct device *dev;

        dev = bus_find_device(&platform_bus_type, NULL, np, of_dev_node_match);
        return dev ? to_platform_device(dev) : NULL;
}

I can't think of any other possible cases.
