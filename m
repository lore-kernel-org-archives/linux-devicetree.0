X-Gene has gic-400 as an interrupt controller.
Only thing is GIC pages are mapped at 64K boundary (with 64K page size)
Hence CPU, VCPU interfaces has a size of 128K (2GIC pages)
Regarding GICC_DIR, yes there is a problem which needs to be solved
since the first page size is 64K.
In XEN we already have a small fix to access GICC_DIR with 64K page
offset instead of standard 4K.
I remember a small discussion in this regard in past
(http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2014-June/266468.html)
which was deferred at that time.
Once this patch is accepted we can post RFC patch to address GICC_DIR
and discuss further.
