No, it is not a typo, but intentional.


i2c0 - i2c3 are connected to the pads of the SoC package.
On the other hand, i2c-4 - i2c-6 are connected to
internal devices inside the SoC package.

i2c-4 - i2c-6 are always connected to the same hardware
devices and always used for the same purpose.


My expected scenario is:

[1] i2c0 - i2c3 are connected to the on-board devices
    depending on board variants.
    On some boards, their status is "okay" and
    on some boards, their status is "disabled".

[2] i2c4 - i2c6 are always used to communicate
    with in-package devices.  The status is always "okay".

[3] Some user-land applications may want to have access
     through the same character devices,
      /dev/i2c4, /dev/i2c5, /dev/i2c6


If your way is adopted,
the real hardware "i2c4" might be aligned to /dev/i2c1 on some boards,
and /dev/i2c2 on others, etc.
