Agreed. The early scan is already done in the init section.

Agreed. Arches can still do however complicated dtb search they want.
This handles the common, default case.

The build rules for built-in dtbs are architecture specific already,
so I don't see a need to make this code configurable at this point.

I really don't like saying one arch can have built-in dtb and another
one can't. Either we allow it or we don't. If this is a bad feature,
then why did we let multiple arches implement it.
