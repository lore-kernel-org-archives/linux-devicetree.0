Mmm. I suppose that's true indeed.

So, I guess either of the following is fine for bcm2836 by me:

compatible = "brcm,bcm2836-armctrl-ic";
compatible = "brcm,bcm2836-armctrl-ic", "brcm,bcm2835-armctrl-ic";

The 2836 value is always needed since DT should contain the most
specific compatible value for the implementation. The 2835 value is
optional based on whether the HW block is 100% backwards-compatible
with the older HW block; a driver for the old block can run unmodified
against the new block. It's debatable whether that's true here; the
interface to this HW block itself is unchanged between
implementations, yet the way the driver for it integrates into the
system differs since it either is/isn't a top-level IRQ chip.
