I know this is how we implemented suspend for i.MX6.  But this is not
the direction moving forward.  When people was pushing a pile of code
adding suspend for i.MX7D, I refused to take it and asked them to push
those hardware details into firmware and use PSCI to implement suspend.
I would like to suggest the same for Vybrid.
