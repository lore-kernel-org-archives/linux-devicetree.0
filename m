Ok, so you basically have the same limitation that we have in DT.

We have syntactical sugar in dtc that allows us to write


	pwms = <&pwm0 0 10>, <&pwm1 1 20>;

or

	pwms = <&pwm0 0 10   &pwm1 1 20>;

but the binary representation of the two is the same. This is the
only reason why we need the #size-cells property and I guess you
do too.

Ok, if you have no way to separate the individual entries in a list of
references, I don't care much, and I can see the "pwm-names" as being more
consistent with the DT syntax.

Is this a limitation in the way that the AML syntax and compiler works,
or is this a decision you made specifically for the _DSD syntax and that
could still be changed if there is an overwhelming interest?
