When I created the patch, there's only omap cpufreq driver using
OPP. If it depends on OPP, it might prevent users who have not
adopted OPP from using the driver.

The driver, for now, assumes all cpu cores uses the same clk and voltage.
It's correct for most arm multi-core SoC.
Do you have real case to need different voltage/clk?
And the regulator will be specified in dts after cpu convert from sys
device to normal device.
