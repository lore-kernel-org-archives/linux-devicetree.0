I know you are still looking for time to review the RPMh-regulator
driver and that's fine.  One idea I had though: if the bindings look
OK to you and are less controversial, is there any chance they could
land in the meantime?

Specifically it would be very handy to be able to post up device tree
files that refer to regulators and even get those landed, but they
can't land without the bindings.

If that's not possible then no worries, but I figured I'd check.
