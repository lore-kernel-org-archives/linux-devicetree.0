/**

   ...

 * @adjtime:  Shifts the time of the hardware clock.

	int (*adjtime)(struct ptp_clock_info *ptp, s64 delta);

That s64 is 's' as in "signed".

As I said in my other reply, I don't understand what the problem is.

I don't get this, either.

But having many readers is less efficient and more complex.

Also, we can adjust the buffer if needed to prevent HW FIFO overflows.

The PTP interface supports poll/read just fine already.

Originally I had the buffer on the stack, but DaveM didn't like it,
saying performance is no excuse for not doing it "the right way".

Thanks,
