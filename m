The new imx7 release have two new codec wm8958 and wm8960. So we have two machine driver
imx-wm8960 and imx-wm8958 which should be upstreamed. I am appreciate that you can help me
merge the imx-wm8960 to fsl-asoc-card. And i will focus on wm8960 and wm8958 driver. And i
will try to merge imx-wm8958 to fsl-asoc-card.
