Mostly the cover letter, but to varying degrees some information should
appear in the commit messages, documentation, and code.

The cover letter should give a high-level overview sufficient to get
reviewing (e.g. that should point out we expect isolation by IOMMUs).
There should also be pointers to related components (i.e. the QEMU
driver intended to communicate with this).

Things subject to change should go in the cover letter, as it's not
permanent.

If something strongly influences the design in a way that's non-obvious,
then that will probably remain non-obvious. For that, there should
certainly be something in the commit message. If it's something that
will be hit in general usage of the binding (or forms part of the
contract of the binding), that should be described in the binding
documentation.

If there's some caveat other developers need to be aware of, drop a
comment in the code.

Thanks,
Mark.
