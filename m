I can assure you I tested without early{con,printk} ;).

Now I have just rechecked the codepaths and something caught my
attention in kernel/printk/printk.c:__add_preferred_console(): if
console_cmdline is empty selected_console gets unconditionally set to
zero ! Knowing this I confirmed by replacing with idx (works), and also
by using ttyS0 (i.e. alias serial0 = &uart2) (works), this would not
affect DTs using serial0. It's late here so I'll stop there.
