Good point.
Will include it in next version.

I am ready with V2, but luckily I did not sent next version, as I
wanted to wait for Lee's response. :)

Oops.

underscore is just typo. did not meant it.

will pick "marvell,irq-write-clr"

It is configurable option, can be changed. so we still need get an
input.

Got it.

rtc and onkey are compatible strings only, I made mistake on regulator.
