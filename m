The code has handling for both read and write so it's not just updating
a write pointer.  Is there no flexibility in the hardware regarding
interrupt generation?

Stopping if we miss an interrupt is precisely the sort of situation we
want to avoid if we can - if the application is sufficiently far ahead
of the hardware everything should continue to work fine.  The minimal
period size appears to be very small so this is a potential issue, if an
application tries to use many very small periods it's both more
vulnerable to some other interrupt taking longer than might be desirable
and likely that things would be fine as the application is hopefully
more than one period ahead of where the hardware is at.

If the hardware is always going to halt at the end of the period there's
not a huge amount we can do about this except possibly raise the minimum
period if systems are running into trouble but if there's a way to avoid
doing that then that would be even better.
