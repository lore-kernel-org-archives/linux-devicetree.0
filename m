Yes, the genpll and genpll_clks are controlled by the same IP block. I
can make the change to combine them to use one DT node. But before doing
that, I just need to get one thing clarified with you. In SW, the pll
and its leaf clocks will still be registered as separate two clock
providers, since we need to be able to configure the PLL vco frequency
and its leaf clock frequencies separately. The pll will be the parent of
its leaf clocks, and the leaf clocks will be used by various peripherals.

I plan to have the combined DT looks like this:

genpll_clks: genpll_clks {
    #clock-cells = <1>;
    compatible = "brcm,cygnus-genpll-clk";
    reg = <0x0301d000 0x2c>;

    assigned-clocks = <&genpll_clks>;
    /* this sets the PLL rate at the time when the PLL clock is
registered */
    assigned-clock-rates = <4000000000>;

    clocks = <&osc>;

    clock-output-names = "axi21", "250mhz", "ihost_sys", "enet_sw",
"audio_125", "can";
};

peripheralA: peripheralA {
    /* use the first leaf clock of genpll */
    clocks = <&genpll_clks 0>;
    clock-frequency  = <100000000>;
};

If we register both the genpll and its leaf clocks to the clock
framework as two separate clock providers, would the above DT entries
still work? For example, peripheralA refers to the phandle of
genpll_clks, but how does the clock framework know to link it to the pll
clock or the leaf clock?

Thanks,

Ray
