I was talking about the kirkwood driver for the I2S and S/PDIF numbers.
Other drivers may have the same problems.

I did not have a look at any other multi-DAI audio CPU/CODEC, so, I can
be wrong.

All I can say is:
- the driver is responsible to define its DAIs,
- it may create them in any order,
- the index of these DAIs is used in the DT.

Then, for you, the DT binding should clearly indicate the relation
between the specifier that follows the phandle and the hardware DAI.

=46or the kirkwood audio controller, with a DT as:

	audio-ports =3D "spdif", "i2s";

the DT documentation should say:

- option 1: "the DAI specifier is always '0' for I2S and '1' for S/PDIF=
"

- option 2: "the DAI specifier is the index of the port in the port dec=
laration"

The actual problem is that there is no port definition in the DT for
the kirkwood audio controller.

On the other side, referencing the DAI by an endpoint nullifies the DAI
specifier problem: this last one does not exist anymore!

Each entity referenced in the graph knows each other one and the simple
dt-card builder works only for one audio controller and one CODEC level
(each audio link in the graph has the controller as an endpoint).

=46or more complex cards, a DT information must exist. It can be:

- a board specific sound node:

	sound {
		compatible =3D "myboard,audio-card";
		... card properties ...
	};

- a device specific sound node:

	sound {
		compatible =3D "mydevice,audio-card";
		audio-root =3D <&audio1>;	/* starting point of the graph */
		... card properties ...
	};

- a generic sound node in the case of multi controllers or multi codec
  levels (after dt-card extension):

	sound {
		compatible =3D "linux,dt-card";
		audio-root =3D <&audio1>;	/* starting point of the graph */
		... card properties ...
	};

=46or the last case, the creation of the simple dt-card builder could b=
e
done by a node in the controller, avoiding the DT to have a knowledge
of this piece of software:

	&audio1 {
		...
		audio-card {
			... card properties ...
		}
		port@0 {
			...
		};
		...
	};

To go further, such a function could fully replace
snd_soc_register_card()!
