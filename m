If you have simple-bus in a compatible list, it should come last. The
list is meant to go from most specific to least specific.

That'll need to be swapped in the example and dts too.

What's the @0x40 for?

Why don't we just have a property on the arm,realview-pb1176-syscon node
to say it can do reset (or just assume that it can)?

This looks like a leak of Linux internals, this isn't really a device.

As far as I am aware, the JZF flags haven nothing to do with the GIC
implementation. I think they can be dropped from this string (following
the example of "arm,arm1176-pmu").

And this isn't part of the CPU, so that string doesn't look right. I'd
at least like to see an additional string earlier in the list

Are these just copied form what we already have for non-DT?

Do we know that these are all necessary?

As a general point, we seem to have so many different ways of formatting
this, and we should standardise.

Thanks,
Mark.
