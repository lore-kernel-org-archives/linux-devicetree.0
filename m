This patch set aims at bringing a device tree support for the sam9261.
It's mostly based on the sam9263 and sam9x5 stuff.

Changes since V4:
* change the compatibilty string for the bus matrix to
  'atmel,at91sam9260-bus-matrix'
* add a documentation for the bus matrix DT binding
* panic if the DT description of the bus matrix is not found
* Fixed the GPIO banks' address range

Changes since V3:
* Added support for the touchscreen
* Added support for the spi dataflash
* Activated the TCB by default
* Reworked the patch organization to reduce the number of patchs
* changed the default bootargs (no mem description, UBI on mtdpart 5)
* Changed the xlate implementation of the at91 pinctrl driver to lock the GPIOs
  for IRQs instead of requesting them (needed for the touchscreen driver)
* some stylistic changes

Changes since V2:
* removed the smc driver from the serie. It'll be posted in an independent
  serie later.
* removed the DM9000 support (it'll come with the smc driver)
* the sam9261 now supports the Common Clock Framework (CCF). Note: to enable
  the CCF you must remove from the kernel config the platforms that don't
  support it.
* Added basic DT binding for the bus matrix
* Added support for USB host
* Added support for USB gadget
* in dts(i), replaced interrupt-parent with interrupts-extended
* changed the nand partition plan (same as for the sama5d3)
* removed 'mem' parameter in command line
* re-ordered dt-nodes in ascending address order.
* split the lcd support patch in 2 parts (SOC and board)


Change since V1:
* changed the DT representation to use address translation and separate the
  timings' configuration from the device properties by adding a "simple-bus"
  inetrmediate node.
* moved the smc driver from drivers/bus to drivers/memmory
* smc driver now accepts timings in nanoseconds as well as raw register values
* smc driver can clip the timings if they're out of bound and dump them to the
  console
* DM9000 timings are now described in nanosecs (for the virtue of example)

supported features are:
* working with the Common Clock Framework and the old at91 clock implementation
* dbgu
* lcdc
* usb host
* usb gadget,
* spi dataflash
* nand flash
* touchscreen
* leds
* user buttons

In the TODO list:
* dm9000 (ethernet)
* audio
* mmc

This serie relies on the following patchs:
usb: at91-udc: fix irq and iomem resource retrieval
ARM: at91: prepare sam9 dt boards transition to common

Jean-Jacques Hiblot (9):
  at91: dt: Adds support for the bus matrix declaration in the DT
  dt: bindings: at91: Add a new binding for the bus matrix
  at91: pinctrl: don't request GPIOs used for interrupts but lock them
    as IRQ
  at91: dt: Add at91sam9261 dt SoC support
  at91: dt: defconfig: Added the sam9261 to the list of DT-enabled SOCs
  at91: dt: sam9261: Device Tree support for the at91sam9261ek
  at91: updated the at91_dt_defconfig with support for the ADS7846
  ARM: at91: prepare common clk transition for sam9261 SoC
  ARM: at91: move sam9261 SoC to common clk
