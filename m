This has to be seen in the context of the suggestion to reference kernel
symbols by name from the DT.

My opinion is that if the interdependence between the components in your
system is non-trivial you should write a proper driver. Otherwise we'll end
up with DT-script and replicate all the terrible things from the ACPI world
where people ship completely horrendous and broken byte code in the firmware.
