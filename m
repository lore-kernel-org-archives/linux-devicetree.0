No, not really.

Yes, I would agree. Guess to solve this kind of problem you might need
some kind of semantics checker, one that knows all existing properties.

For the DRM problem you described in your original e-mail, frankly I don't
have an idea how to solve it. So I'd rather not even try. For the semantics
checking problems, maybe someone with some free time will step up and write
one ... if that is even feasible. But even then I suspect it will always be
easy to make mistakes in property values.
