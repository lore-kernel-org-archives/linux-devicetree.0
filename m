Yes, we configure them in Interrupt Enable (IE) register, each bit represents
one interrupt source.
Besides IE register, there's Interrupt Line Select (ILS) register which
controls each interrupt source is routed to which interrupt line (int0 or int1).
Be default, we route all interrupts source to int0.

Understand, i'm fine with this way.

Good catch!
You're right! I aslo found this recently!
txb_off already includes the mram_off so should not plus mram_off again.
The former test did not find it because it's still not exceed the 16K ram
size for m_can0. But m_can1 has such issue.

> I even think mram_off should be removed from the priv.

Right, i also think so.

It is used for debug information formerly that we need mram_off
to calculate each element address in the fifo.

By removing mram_off, i'm going to change the debug information to:
dev_dbg(&pdev->dev, "mram_base %p sidf 0x%x %d xidf 0x%x %d rxf0 %x %d rxf1 %x %d rxb %x %d txe %x %d txb %x %d\n",
	priv->mram_base, priv->sidf_off, priv->sidf_elems,
	priv->xidf_off, priv->xidf_elems, priv->rxf0_off,
	priv->rxf0_elems, priv->rxf1_off, priv->rxf1_elems,
	priv->rxb_off, priv->rxb_elems, priv->txe_off,
	priv->txe_elems, priv->txb_off, priv->txb_elems);

The annoying thing is the line has to be a much bigger one to avoid
checkpatch warning of "WARNING: quoted string split across lines".

What's your suggestion for such issue?
Keeping the big line or split into two lines and leave checkpatch warning there?

Yes, *_off fit into u16 since MRAM has a maximum of 4352 words(17K).
And *_elems fit into u8 since the max number is 128.
I will change them accordingly.

You mean something like below?
struct mram_cfg {
	u16 off;
	u8  elements;
};

struct m_can_priv {
	........

        struct mram_cfg sidf;
        struct mram_cfg xidf;
        struct mram_cfg rxf0;
        struct mram_cfg rxf1;
	......
        struct mram_cfg txb;
};
