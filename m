I've thought about it some more. We can actually get rid of the
CONFIG_REALVIEW_HIGH_PHYS_OFFSET option entirely for any case except
CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL by using ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT and relying on the
ATAGS or DT to pass the correct memory location. Unfortunately,
I don't know if the ATAGS are actually correct in common boot loaders,
since the kernel has been overriding them for ages.

With SPARSEMEM enabled, we already depend on REALVIEW_HIGH_PHYS_OFFSET
being disabled, and we also use ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT by default (it
is not disabled in realview_defconfig).

The dependencies are really:

* The value of PHYS_OFFSET must match the address to which the kernel
  is loaded at boot time (currently enforced using 'make uImage').

* We could use SPARSEMEM in order to use all 512MB of RAM on
  realview-eb/pb11mp/pb-a8, but this is prevented by the definition
  of __phys_to_virt/__virt_to_phys, since it puts the 0x20000000
  physical memory segment into the middle! This is in theory fixable,
  but I'd rather not add more hacks on top. I don't see anything that
  prevents us from using SPARSEMEM on older realview machines with
  PHYS_OFFSET=0.

* The board files always ignore the memory passed in the ATAGS and
  set what they think is correct. I consider this a bad idea,
  in particular because it prevents us from using the -m option
  in qemu. We should not do this with DT. If we just trust the
  DT to contain correct data, we don't actually need the
  REALVIEW_HIGH_PHYS_OFFSET setting,

Catalin originally added the sparsemem hack. I asked him today about
it, and he also thinks that sparsemem without the hack should work,
as long as there is highmem support. I think we can either do away
with it entirely, or use the patch below to keep it alive.

I'd prefer not to add any memory location fixup to the realview-dt
implementation, but it seems hard to kill it off for the ATAGS
based board files, in particular because the information passed
by qemu seems to be wrong more often than not (at least if I read
the qemu right), and we never relied on it in the past. We might
be able to make that a compile-time or boot-time option though.
