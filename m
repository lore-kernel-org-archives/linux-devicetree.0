I'm not sure if "snps,dw-mipi-dsi" should be appended.

Is it a compatible string that SoC specific drivers should actually use to
bind a device?

As Andy mentioned in [1], DW MIPI DSI embedded in RK618 is configured via I2C
bus, while i.MX6Q/DL is configured via ARM bus...

Another concern is that if users only specify "snps,dw-mipi-dsi" in their
device tree sources and use a kernel which supports multiple platforms,
say ARM multi v7 platforms, could several enabled SoC specific drivers be
probed for a single DW MIPI DSI device?

What MIPI CSI-2 datasheets do you refer to?
I don't find the refclk and cfg_clk in the MIPI CSI chapter of the i.MX6DQ
Reference Manual v2[2].

I think we need to know the design philosophy of DW MIPI DSI clock sources
to settle down the documentation here.  I've asked our internal MIPI DSI
SoC owner for ideas.  But, someone from Synopsys might be the right
person, perhaps.

The same MIPI CSI-2 documentation you mentioned above?

I'm also puzzled about the clocks.
