Laura,

Sorry to hijack the thread (sort of).  :)

I brought this up at last weeks devicetree irc meeting.  My goal is to
provide early randomness for kaslr on ARM.  Currently, my idea is modify
the init script to save an additional random seed from /dev/urandom to
/boot/random-seed.

The bootloader would then load this file into ram, and pass the
address/size to the kernel either via dt, or commandline.  kaslr (run in
the decompressor) would consume some of this randomness, and then
random.c would consume the rest in a non-crediting initialization.

While not ideal, it works in absence of an HRNG, and is no worse than
the current situation of storing the seed in /var/lib/misc/random-seed.
It also doesn't require modification of the bootloaders.  Just an
updated kernel, and update the bootloader environment to load the
seed.

Unfortunately, it's an idea so far.  I have one project to get off of my
plate, then this is next :)

thx,

Jason.
