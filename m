You should drop the latter compatible.

Hmm, there isn't one for the AXP806 either.

It should be vddio-wifi. Looking at the pin groups it names, it likely
just drives the I/O pins on both ends.

vcc-pa or vddio-gmac. 2.5V is for RGMII I/O. vcc-gmac is the "sw"
regulator @ 3.3V.

PLLs and DLLs are different though. Maybe vcc-pll-dll?

vcc12-hsic is actually the name listed in the SoC datasheet.

vcc-pl is probably better... One can figure out the LEDs are connected to the
PL group and maybe realize they are powered this way. Not that easy the other
way around.

I used really long names for the other 2 A80 boards though.
