I think what the da850.dtsi does is wrong. The dtsi file should not set=
 any
pinmux, those need to be set by the board .dts files If one board uses =
McASP0,
it will set up the pins for that and leave McBSP pins as they were, but=
 other
board might use McBSP1 and not use McASP0, there you will have pincontr=
ol for
McBSP1.
