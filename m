In the past, you have told me that you don't want the .dts changes and code
changes in the same patch. In this case, if you apply either one separately,
it will break clocks. It does not matter which one is first.

So either we have to squash [PATCH v5 44/44] ARM: dts: da850: Add clocks
into this patch or deal with the breakage.
