No, that's not a solution.

It is fairly easy to qualify a small set of bindings as "stable" for 
interoperability purpose (e.g. for qemu/kvm).

But for the vast majority it is very hard to decide when a particular 
binding has reached stability.  By definition, a binding may be 
considered "stable" only after seeing no change for a reasonable period 
of time being tested and used.  So stability may simply not be a 
criterion for upstream merging.

I think it is best to establish any process around DT assuming no strong 
binding stability.  Eventually the DT binding update frequency will 
converge to zero while the kernel will continue to be developed.  But 
the DTB for a particular hardware might have to change from time to 
time.
