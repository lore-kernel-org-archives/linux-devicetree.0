Most other subsystems don't require a name, and traditionally we only
had anonymous indexed properties for a lot of things (registers, 
interrupts, ...).

I still like the idea of using anonymous references for simple things,
but if you and Linus feel that it's better to mandate names from now on,
I won't complain.

Ok.
