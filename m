That is a good point, I agree. I have some thoughts on this:

If this is configurable on both ends, the necessary setting is neither a
hardware property of the bridge, nor of the display interface, but
rather one of the board specific wiring between the two (if at all).

Ideally all possible settings should be known to the drivers and the
best format should be negotiated. Note that display_info.bus_formats
already is an array of possible bus formats, even though the parallel
display driver currently only looks at the first element.

If there is no limitation imposed by the wiring, presenting best format
first in that array seems reasonable for now.

Otherwise I think the links should describe the parallel bus layout,
which is specified for the (input) media video interfaces:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt

Using the
	bus-width = <24>;
or
	bus-width = <12>;
property the tfp510 driver could choose which bus_formats to add to the
display_info.

Philipp
