Yes, I think this is the only reasonable option. I'll send v2.

Yes, according to schematics Bluetooth is on uart1.
It's an Ampak 6212A with a Broadcom 43438 chip. To my understanding
it's the same chip in the Raspberry Pi 3 B / B+ and Raspberry Zero W.

I've tried to integrate support for Bluetooth with the following:

&uart1 {
    pinctrl-names = "default";
    pinctrl-0 = <&uart1_pins>, <&uart1_rts_cts_pins>;
    status = "okay";

    bluetooth {
        compatible = "brcm,bcm43438-bt";
        max-speed = <2000000>;
        shutdown-gpios = <&pio 0 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PA10 */
        device-wakeup-gpios = <&pio 9 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PL2 */
        host-wakeup-gpios = <&pio 0 20 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PA20 */
    };
};

but the hci_bcm driver doesn't load automatically and doesn't probe
the device when loaded manually. I haven't investigated further.
