Excuse me, I think I just don't get the approach how to use clock API to
standardize the MCLK derived from ESAI IP: it's surely not a fixed-clock
so we couldn't register in DT and it's not SoC internal clock which means
we couldn't register it in the SoC clock driver either.

Could you please shed me some light on it?

Thank you,
