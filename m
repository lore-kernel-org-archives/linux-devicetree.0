Maybe it's just me then :)

Without going that far, we could have the little/big endian topic here
as well.

But I guess it all boils down to wether we should support only the
trivial cases, or not. Generally speaking, and not just about the OPPs
above, we could really well end up with a "generic" (not necessarily a
really generic driver, but also IPs used across several SoCs, like the
Mentor/Synopsis ones) driver, requiring to read some data from an
EEPROM for some reason.

Where would you fit the raw data parsing code? In that generic
driver. It would end up being just as messy, if not more.

So yeah, it really depends on wether we just want to support reading a
contiguous block of data, or if we want to cover all cases. And in
that case, we should indeed support the cases you mentioned above.

Or even a single board. Most of the drivers are in that case. That
doesn't mean that the frameworks should just ignore them entirely
because of that fact.
