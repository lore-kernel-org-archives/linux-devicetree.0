It's actually a MAC to MAC type of set up here, so the definition of the
property kind of still applies, with the caveat that we need to make
sure that if one side uses "rgmii", the other one uses "rgmii-txid"
which is what is being done here. I think I typoed in the commit message
in that it should read "STMMAC does not take care of inserting the
transmitter delay here" which is why the switch must do it.

Thanks!
