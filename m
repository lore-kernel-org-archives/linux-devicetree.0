I think you are getting confused because the data sheet uses
the same names as the kernel, but they are really different
things.

How about boards that have i2c connectors that are labeled
differently?

We want the aliases to match whatever is written on the
board normally, to make it easier for users.

That user space would however only work on boards with the
same SoC, which is not a safe assumption to make. Either
it should be specific to just one board which has a known
set of buses, or it should be done in a way that works
across SoC generations of families.

Ideally the devices on the internal buses would have an
in-kernel driver that exports a high-level API to avoid this
problem. What devices are these?

Right, I think that is how it should be. You could also make
the chip's i2c4 always link to user space /dev/i2c0 if you
want to keep those stable, but as I said that is still not
a good (software) system design.
