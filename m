I knew your intention. That's why I suggested you to merge it directly
to fsl-asoc-card instead of making a duplicated copy of that. Remember
that getting code upstream should be a chance for us to improve thing.

If you find painstaking to handle it in parallel, you can focus on the
improvements of the WM8960 driver while I would help you on the dai-
link part. How about this?
