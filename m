Just triggering the automatic calibration sounds good, this likely will
result in better values then the magic values we are currently using for
older SoCs.

As for the meaning of those registers, what we've been doing with the phase
registers so far pretty much boils down to look at what Allwinner BSP kernel
sources do, and then do the same in u-boot / the mainline driver since
the mmc controller documentation is very limited.

Do you have a git tree with your wip mmc support somewhere ? Then I or
maybe Chen-Yu can take a look when we've time.

Regards,

Hans
