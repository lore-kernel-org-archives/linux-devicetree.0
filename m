No, there is no way for a consumer to do that. The provider must do it.

Upon further reflection, I think that your clock consumer can probably
use clk_set_rate_range() to "lock" in a rate. This is good because it is
exactly what a clock consumer should do:

1) get the clk
2) enable the clk
3) set the required rate for the clock
4) set rate range constraints, or conversely,
5) lock in an exact rate; set the min/max rate to the same value

The problem with this solution is that it requires the consumer to have
knowledge of the rates that it wants for that clock, which I guess is
something that Linux kernels in a Xen setup do not want/need?

Is it correct that you would prefer some sort of never_touch_this_clk()
api?
