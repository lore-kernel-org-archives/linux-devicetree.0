I didn't notice there's a sister model for CS42888. But good to know.

And I think I should try cs42x88.c as the driver name, which makes sense
even if we have another sister here. Or Brian may give me a more official
one?

It would be better if I also put those CS42488's support into the driver
but I'll start a long vacation from tomorrow. So if I am not able to do
that for CS42488's parts in the short time, I'll send the CS42888 part
first by the end of the day and we can add CS42488 later.

Thanks all,
