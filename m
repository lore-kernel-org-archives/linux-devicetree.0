Some drivers are common to all orion, but others are only used in some
out of {orion5k,kirkwood,mv78xx0,dove}. You could of course have
an orion.dtsi that is included in kirkwood.dtsi.

BTW, I just realized that the patches that Haojian Zhuang sent for
pxa/mmp are using mrvl instead of marvell, and you should definitely
be using the same identifier both both. By convention we use the
stock ticker symbol as a unique identifier, which would be mrvl here.

I would still list both, so we are future-proof in case we need
to modify the driver in the future but don't want to modify
the device tree.

Yes.

Sounds right to me.
