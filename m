I certainly disagree here; the absolute worst kind of test is one which
gives different results each time it's run, or statically gives
different results to different people. People will either ignore the
test because it's flaky, or it'll end up blaming the wrong person due to
some entirely unrelated and correct change just happening to tickle the
test.

If we were to force any such new test to always run under valgrind, then
hopefully the test would always fail (assuming the test harness triggers
failure if valgrind finds problems). That might be reasonable. However,
if we do this, then I think instead we should just always force the
entire existing test suite to run under valgrind; no new test should be
needed for valgrind to detect this failure (since there was a
read-before-write problem any time a label was used in the existing
code, it just didn't always cause a user-visible issue).

Another alternative might be to LD_PRELOAD a test malloc library with a
known allocation pattern. That would allow a new test for this case to
always fail. However, the allocation pattern of this test malloc library
would have to be carefully tied to the allocation pattern of dtc itself
when processing the new test's .dts file, and that could easily and
legitimately change due to unrelated implementation details of dtc
changing, thus making the maintenance of the test malloc library
painful. So, I don't think this is the way to go.
