I don't care too much which tree the binding description goes through either,
as long as it is kept in sync.

The header file is really the main issue we need to worry about. My preferred
way of doing this would be to give it an extra merge window: add the binding
document and the header file in one merge window, and then add the dts files
and the driver one release later. I've seen a lot of header files added for
no good reason at all, and at least that way we can get people to think about
the dependency more.

It's also ok to merge the header file and binding with either the dts file
changes or the driver and then do the other part the following release.

In the past, we've worked around the issue by merging the driver through
arm-soc, or by merging the dts changes through a driver tree, with the
appropriate Acks in each case. Both of those approaches work of course,
but the former always feels awkward to me as we are not using the right
maintainer path, and the latter approach tends to cause merge conflicts,
especially when multiple headers for different subsystems get added or
the dts files are added at the same time.

Having a shared branch for the header file is another way to do it, and
we can do that in some cases, but I'd prefer not to make it the default.
