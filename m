Agree on matter of potential overflow.

I wouldn't limit users with 32 characters for node name if it's not by both
ACPI and DT specifications. OTOH allocating and freeing memory in a loop each
time when we would like to go through the child nodes sounds much worse
scenario to me. Thus, giving a length of the buffer is a good enough compromise.

I don't think this concept is changed by Heikki's patch series. It provides a
common abstract function on top of more low-level firmware implementation which
I consider a good approach.
