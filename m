Hi Mark,
thanks for the continued feedback - please see below.

Will look at this again in context of later Kernel versions and make
sure we'll get this fixed as needed.

The only way to prevent the device from throwing those crazy
300us-spaced SAIF errors would be by (1) providing an always-on SAIF
audio stream (not really a solution...), or (2) by keeping it in
SHUTDOWN most of the time (while not actively playing audio) which is
what I attempted.

Agreed, this is not the first time this has come up :( Btw in my quest
for a solution one of my earlier implementations actually hooked into
the MUTE handler, but while this worked keeping the TA5720 in shutdown
most of the time it did not completely solve the interrupt-overrun issue
(the TAS5720 would still generate SAIF errors for brief periods,
dead-locking my SoC even with an empty threaded handler). I was also
concerned that hooking such parasitic code into a MUTE handler would be
a bit of an abuse and not make me may friends here.

> What is the value in implementing it?

There is a strong request from one rather large customer to have
interrupt-driven fault handling. I did have an early implementation of
the driver that polled for errors (except SAIF) at the beginning and the
end of the audio playback but this was not good enough.

But thinking about this some more, what if I do not actually use the
interrupt signal, but rather during playback use a timer that fires
every let's say 1s to check the TAS5720 fault register? This way one
would still get critical error reporting _during_ the playback (which is
likely the reason for the customer requirement) of longer audio files,
and while not immediate, this should still give a good enough response
time as the errors being reported (over current, over temp, ...) would
be latched and their detection involves some time constants as well. Any
comments/concerns with such an approach?

Thanks,
