I still don't understand why the ASoC platform has to be exposed in
device tree; it seems like something completely internal to the ASoC
driver. Take a look at the Tegra ASoC DT bindings; the platform isn't in
DT at all there.

I think the DT binding should only support phandle-based resolution.
Name-based resolution would be quite odd for a device tree binding.

When I was thinking about a more generic DT binding for audio, quite a
while ago, I certainly was planning to have each CODEC expose some kind
of "of_xlate" function that could prase the integer interface ID in
device tree, and convert it to a string name for internal use by ASoC.

OK, I guess if this is I2S bus clock rather than I2S module clock, then
this is fine as-is. Not all I2S controllers can implement this though.
