Thanks for the explanation above. It helped clarify things for me.

So, can you have some sort of dummy driver in Linux that claims the
resources needed by Xen and calls the necessary Linux apis to insure
that Xen's needs are satisfied? As I mentioned in my previous reply
from a couple of minutes ago:

struct clk *clk = clk_get(xen_dev, ...);
clk_prepare_enable(clk);
clk_set_rate_range(...);

I'm not sure where the rate info should come from, but this represents a
correct use of clk consumer apis.
