This was already in the dts files for db410c. In the chipidea binding
one is for EXTCON_USB (vbus) and one is for EXTCON_USB_HOST (id). My
understanding is that extcon-usb-gpio.c sends events for both EXTCON_USB
and EXTCON_USB_HOST when the gpio changes state. vbus detection is not
that great on this board because we only have on gpio for this.
