Right, I knew there must be a trade off.  So, how about I submit a
patch with a fixed value of 4 for whichever platforms you think is
correct.

I see the 4 compatibles are:  fsl,mpc8610-ssi, fsl,imx51-ssi,
fsl,imx35-ssi, and fsl,imx21-ssi.

Shall I submit a patch that sets the value to 4 for for any/all of the
above?  Should it be different based on whether fiq is enabled.  Maybe
set it to 4 for whenever DMA is used, and to 13 whenever FIQ is used?
