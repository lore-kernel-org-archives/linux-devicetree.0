I skimmed though this and it doesn't look horrible (how's that for
positive feedback? ;) ). But before going into the details, I think
first there needs to be agreement this is the right direction.

The question does remain though as to whether this class of devices
should be platform drivers. They can't be modules. They can't be
hotplugged. Can they be runtime-pm enabled? So the advantage is ...

I assume that the clock maintainers had some reason to move clocks to
be platform drivers. It's just not clear to me what that was.

So devm_kzalloc will work with this solution? Why did we need
devm_kzalloc in the first place? The clocks can never be removed and
cleaning up on error paths is kind of pointless. The system would be
hosed, right?

Can we really do this in one spot for different devices (clk, timers,
irq). The sequence is all very carefully crafted. Platform specific
hooks is another thing to consider.

This could leave devices in a weird state. They've successfully probed
early, but then are on the deferred list for normal probe for example.
