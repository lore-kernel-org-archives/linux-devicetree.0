checkpatch warns that you should not include this paragraph because the
mail address might change in the future and it is contained in COPYING.

Doesn't this board get its own compatible?

It's ok to keep this property for now, but in the future I'd like it to
be removed. The panel driver should provide all necessary information
using drm_display_info_set_bus_formats. The imx parallel-display driver
then needs to be made aware of the connector display_info->bus_formats.

What panel is this? I'd prefer if you used the panel-simple driver here
and connected it to the ldb channel using OF graph bindings same as the
parallel display above. That would allow to remove the fsl,data-mapping
and fsl,data-width properties and the display-timings node.

Typo, "support for". Also, maybe s/board/boards/ as this contains the
common parts for both the 4 and 7 variant?

This should be "dlg,da9063" as per
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/da9063.txt.

The clocks property is already contained in imx6dl.dtsi

Do all aristainetos2 boards have all of these ports routed out? (Should
the status = "okay" properties be set here, or in the per-board .dts
files?)
