Yeah, we have a pathological case of confusion of config information
between PPIs and SPIs:
- SPIs are always rising-edge or active-high
- PPIs are implementation defined, and even their configurability is
implementation defined

The fact that on all ARM implementations, the PPI are not configurable
is the saving grace. No matter how wrong the DTs are, we'll do the right
thing, and all the existing code actually relies on the defaults values
anyway.

Well, until someone tries and configure a PPI (at least Qualcomm's
implementations are actually programmable), and asks for an active-low
value, which will get rejected.

Basically, all can we do at the GIC level is to accept all combinations
of edge/level for PPIs, reduce that to the single bit of config we have,
and check that it sticks. The result may not be what the driver asked
for, but we have no way to know.

GIC bindings will have to be updated too.

Thanks,

	M.
