Please see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/submitting-patches.txt.

Specifically:

* Please put binding documents earlier in the series than code
  implementing the binding.

* Please document _all_ compatible strings used in the
  series.

Please also write the binding documents in terms of the hardware, rather
then the driver (e.g. introduce what the hardware is in the document,
don't mention the driver). The bindings are there to describe the former
to the latter, and the latter may change arbitrarily.

AFAICT, this is the first use of this directory. We should have a
general FSI binding document in there, covering what FSI is, the
"ibm,fsi-master" binding, etc.

There's very little information here, so I'm not sure what to make of
this. Can you please elaborate on the above to make it clear what this
means?

IIUC, this is an FSI controller/master that we only communicate with via
GPIOs, right?

Or is this a *virtual* master? i.e. the GPIOs themselves form the master
and are directly connected to slaves?

Please give a description of what each of these are used for, how many
are required, and what order elements must come in.

Likewise.

This is backwards. The most specific string must come first.

If this were described above, we don't need the comment here.

I note that in the patch, the mux-gpios property has an unmatched '>'
and won't compile.

As a general nit, please bracket elements of a list individually, e.g.

	trans-gpios = <&gpio 3>, <&gpio 9>;
	mux-gpios = <&gpio 4>, <&gpio 10>;

Thanks,
Mark.
