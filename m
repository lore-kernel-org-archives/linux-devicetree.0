My changes don't change the current behavior much: currently
early_init_dt_scan() is already called with &__dtb_start in several places.
If this is broken, it's already broken.

Multiple dtb blobs are currently handled in platform-specific code, which
passes the right dtb to early_init_dt_scan().

On ARM and PowerPC, the section is empty, hence &__dbt_start ==
&__dtb_end.
