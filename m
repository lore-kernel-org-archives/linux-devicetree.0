So, I had a discussion with Marvell engineers and a closer look at the
matter. It turns out that those two clock registers are in the middle
of an area called DFX (Design for Testability), which contain registers
to fine tune the silicon and detect manufacturing issues. This area of
registers is most likely never going to be publicly documented, and the
fact that those two clock-related registers were placed there was more
an oversight than a real architecture choice.

For this reason, there is in fact no real benefit in mapping the entire
area using a syscon, and having the two DT nodes for the core clocks
and ring clocks, mapping just their own registers is by far the
simplest solution considering the register layout.

We would prefer to keep things as proposed in terms of DT
representation, with the understanding that the submission of the Linux
support for this platform comes very early in the chip development
cycle, and that as such, the DT bindings should be considered unstable.

Thanks a lot,

Thomas
