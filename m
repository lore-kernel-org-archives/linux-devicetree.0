Then what's your problem with these patches again ?

I am just asking the driver to match the generic binding instead of the SoC
specific, because we are also using it on other SoC, as explain in the patch
comment. Does not seems that "pointless" to me.

Right now the driver match only on: vendor,soc-one
in dts, we have compatible = "vendor,family", "vendor,soc-one" 

but it is compatible with soc-two as well.
to match we would have to put "vendor,soc-one" as well which is a mess

By expressing correctly what the driver is compatible with, "vendor,family"
we can dts that makes sense for soc-two as well
compatible = "vendor,family", "vendor,soc-two"

Same goes for the other patches
