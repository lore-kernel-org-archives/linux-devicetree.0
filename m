Changes in v5:
- drop iomux/pinctrl function container node as suggested by Shawn
- added new line between nodes as suggested by Shawn
- use consistent pinctrl group node naming schema xxxgrp as suggested b=
y Shawn
- replace the gpio-key,wakeup property with the generic wakeup-source o=
ne as suggested by Shawn
- drop regulators function container node and use simple label referenc=
e to enable USB VBUS' as suggested by Shawn

Changes in v4: None
Changes in v3:
- integrated review feedback from Petr
- integrated review feedback from Stefan
- fix comment concerning Apalis GPIO usage as GPIO7 is only used for PC=
Ie switch reset on Apalis Evaluation board
- move I2C DDC handling into carrier board DTS where it belongs
- simplify RTC alias

Changes in v2:
- clarify exact Apalis iMX6Q/D SoM type in cover letter
- clarify exact Apalis iMX6Q/D module type and Ixora carrier board in m=
odel
  node
- got rid of obsolete mmc aliases
- working SGTL5000 audio/sound integration
- working STMPE811 touch screen controller integration
- integrated review feedback from Lucas
- left and even added some more comments as I don't see why putting any
  explanatory comments in dts' should be such a bad thing to do
- completely got rid of the memory node as that is something typically =
filled
  in by the boot loader e.g. U-Boot
- without the regulators simple-bus it no longer boots
- even though we supposedly shipped a few hundred V1.0a modules drop DC=
E UART
  support for now and simplify file layout
- replaced obsolete no-1-8-v by mainline supported voltage-ranges =3D <=
3300 3300>
  usdhc property and yes card detects are indeed active low (;-p)
- integrated review feedback from Stefan
- fixed Ethernet PHY reset & interrupt (requires Micrel PHY driver to b=
e
  enabled)
- fixed HDMI DDC (requires GPIO-based bitbanging I2C to be enabled)
- fixed SPDIF
