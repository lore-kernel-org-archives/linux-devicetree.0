Yes, using long long is the best possible solution and covers all cases 
whereas this patch does not.

I thought that do_div() would cause a lot of overhead, but I noticed that it's 
not big if both numbers fit in 32 bit, which in our case is true most of the 
time.

I will make a helper function for calculating rate, since using long long 
needs more than one line of code.

Best regards,
Jernej
