I can see multiple ways to do this here:

- create a child node for the nvram settings and document that the properties
  in there follow exactly the format that is used for the nvram file.

- have just one property that contains a copy of the entire nvram file,
  serving as a backing store for the file instead of pointing to the file.

- figure out more about the actual properties that are required and then
  document only the ones that are actually different between devices using
  the same chip. With a per-chip file that we can put into linux-firmware,
  and the data from the OTP ROM, we might need only a small subset here
  that fits well enough in the DT.

I thought the outcome was to never put file names into DT for new bindings, because
it doesn't do what you want in the end: Either the "compatible" string correctly
identifies the device and can be used to construct or look up a file name, or
the compatible string is not enough to actually identify the device and should
be extended with a more specific one.

Having the module identifer in a property to use that along with the compatible
string for the file name would also work, but I think just using the compatible
string list by itself makes more sense.
