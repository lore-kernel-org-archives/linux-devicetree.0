That's funny, because I get the below on both 4.14 and 4.15-rc1. And I
expect the same ever since the driver was added some 3 years ago.

$ scripts/get_maintainer.pl your-patch-from[1].diff | grep Peter
Peter Rosin <peda@axentia.se> (maintainer:NXP TFA9879 DRIVER)

[1] https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/815930/

By the way, scripts/checkpatch.pl on that patch reports
WARNING: added, moved or deleted file(s), does MAINTAINERS need updating?

actual file while at it...
