This patch set adds support for the DA7219 audio codec with built-in
advanced accessory detection functionality. Patch set includes codec driver,
associated DT bindings documentation and MAINTAINERS file updates to cover new
bindings.

This patch set is baselined against the v4.3-rc2 kernel version.

Changes in v2:
 - Add SOC_DOUBLE_R_EXT support to ASoC core.
 - Use of upper-case naming for controls, where missing.
 - Use of Playback/Capture Digital naming for certain ADC/DAC controls.
 - CP mchange and vol_thresh DT bindings removed, now Kcontrols
 - Kcontrols and DAPM now locked as part of hptest work, and specific controls
   affected have had locking introduced.
 - Timeout for btn_det work when checking micbias status.
 - Added comments to describe reasoning for work use with hptest, btn_det.
 - Added comments to tonegen_freq_put/get to clarify endian conversion, and
   code now uses regmap_raw_read/write calls instead of bulk.
 - DT parsing code now prints dev_warn() for invalid settings.
 - SOC_VALUE_ENUM_SINGLE now used for hpf_mode handling, instead of customer
   get/put handlers.
 - DTMF key control now a SOC_ENUM to correctly describe supported keys,
   including non-numeric.
 - MIXIN_L_MIX_EN bit set as part of DAPM now (SUPPLY), rather than in probe.
 - Fix dai_sysclk() function to correctly check for no change, using clk_id as
   well as freq.
 - Error checking added for clk_set_rate() call.
 - Improved error checking for devm_clk_get() call.
 - Removed explicit use of device_may_wakeup() and enable/disable_irq_wake().
   Now taken care of by I2C core so DT bindings updated accordingly to
   document this.
 - hptest work now uses cache to keep state, instead of reading registers
   individually. Cache is bypassed, then when test executed and complete,
   regcache_sync_region() used to restore settings to pre-test values.
 - Regulator consumer framework usage added, in particular to determine VDDIO
   level in use so device can be configured accordingly. DT documents updated
   to reflect this.
