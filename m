And the reason we went into this direction is that the end-users that use
these SoCs with complex pipelines actually *need* this functionality. Which
is also part of the reason why work on improved userspace support gets
little attention: they don't need to have a plugin that allows generic V4L2
applications to work (at least with simple scenarios).

If they would need it, it would have been done (and paid for) before.

And improving userspace support for this isn't even at the top of our prio
list: getting the request API and stateless codec support in is our highest
priority. And that's a big job as well.

If you want to blame anyone for this, blame Nokia who set fire to their linux-based
phones and thus to the funding for this work.

Yes, I am very unhappy with the current state, but given the limited resources
I understand why it is as it is. I will try to get time to work on this this summer,
but there is no guarantee that that will be granted. If someone else is interested
in doing this and can get funding for it, then that would be very welcome.
