Hi Mark,
well in any of the left-justified modes (which are the only ones the
driver supports) the device takes and processes as many bits as it can
given the clock and divider settings. Any extra bits provided will get
ignored, and the next sync happens on the frame sync signal and not by
counting bits so there is no downside also as confirmed by some bench
testing I did feeding in 32-bit long frames for one channel. This seems
like a case of preferring tolerance over strictly enforcing
datasheet-advertised bit-widths. Will take out the check code.

Ok will tweak it.

Yes make sense. As suggested promoting this to dev_crit() and making sure
its adequately phrased will help.

I had to actually craft my own DC "audio" file to play with aplay to
trigger this error during testing. So when this happens I'd think it is
likely something userspace is "doing wrong" (of course there could be
other reasons too such a broken-off SAIF DIN/DOUT trace) but let's make
this also for the sake of consistency a dev_crit() too.

Along these lines, earlier as I was rummaging through the existing
drivers looking for a solution I could model after I noticed that
most(?) ASoC codec drivers don't have any type of HW fault checking, at
at least whatever drivers I looked at. Not sure why this is but given
this discussion this seems like a general opportunity to make
improvements.

Andreas
