Yes, that's the worrying part for me. ;-)

Ok, fair enough.  It would be helpful if this account of attempting to
reconcile the old driver made it into the commit message.  This puts us
in "perfect is the enemy of getting it done" territory.

A fair proposal, but I'll freely admit the number of people actually auditing
their code paths is orders of magnitude smaller than the number of users
of the driver.

There's such a large population of compatible legacy SoCs in the wild,
adding an artificial boundary doesn't make sense.  Especially since
we're talking about features everyone would want to use.

Perhaps we should keep both around, and deprecate the legacy driver over
3 to 4 cycles?

thx,

Jason.
