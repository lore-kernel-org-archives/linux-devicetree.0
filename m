Turning on bias is controlled separately, automatically in user-space in
many cases, not based on the board. The DT needs to have a way to state
that 0v is the needed bias on this board, without this you can not set
0v bias and 2v is chosen by default (which is IMHO should be 0v but that
would change existing behavior so I won't touch that).
