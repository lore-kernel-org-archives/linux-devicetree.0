Yeah we should do the minimal fix for the $Subject bug for the -rc cycle
so I can fix the PM test regression fix for the few omap3 platforms
already made DT only.

Yes. And BTW, there's also another related glitch where there's no easy
way to configure auxdata from arch/arm/mach code for some devices.

For example, consider something like this that's fairly common:

1. i2c bus driver configured with DT and can take board specific auxdata

2. i2c bus intializes connected devices as configured with DT but
   cannot pass board specific auxdata as the auxdata for the i2c bus
   is empty

3. i2c connected pmic driver intializes as configured with DT, but
   cannot get board specifc auxdata

So we should probably add some parent or master auxdata table that's
also checked if the bus specific auxdata table is empty.

Ideally of course we'd have Linux generic way of doing this that works
for platform data, DT and ACPI without changing the existing interfaces :)
