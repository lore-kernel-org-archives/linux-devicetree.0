That reads like my words a year ago:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/22/408

Initially pretty much everything was hard-coded in the driver.

Arnd then pushed to use more descriptive in the device tree.

Of course, we should not end up making up relations which are not there
in hardware. We need to find the right balance.

Here is my suggestion:
1. Add "fsl,vf610-soc-bus" as compatible string to the soc node, use it
to bind the "soc bus driver" as a platform driver located in driver/soc/
2. Add ROM as syscon device (it is not erasable ROM memory, hence eeprom
seems not to be appropriate)
3. In the new soc bus driver, search for the relevant nodes using
hardcoded strings:
   - "ocrom" to get the syscon device, read the ROM revision with the
hardcoded offset
   - "ocotp" to get the NVMEM device or "cfg0"/"cfg1" to the cells
directly, read the values using the defined cells.
   - "mscm_cpucfg" is already there as a syscon device

Arnd, Rob, does that sound reasonable?
