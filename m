I had never heard of simple-card.  It doesn't look like it supports
device tree.  Novena doesn't have a platform definition, and we run
entirely using DT.  If simple-card can work without a platform
definition, then we can use it.  Otherwise, it's nearly identical to
imx-sgtl5000.c, with the exception of the code you called out.

It does seem simple.  I could imagine specifying the jack in a device
tree file, and mapping it to a GPIO.

Can you think of why this would oops on removal?  If I disable
headphone jack detection (by simply making data->jack_gpio an invalid
gpio), the module removes cleanly.

Can you direct me to this patch?  Is it supposed to be defined in the
device tree file?  As of right now, the clock is hardcoded to 24 MHz
in clk-imx6q.c, which is why we need to change it here.
