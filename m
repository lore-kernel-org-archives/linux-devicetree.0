'pulse' covers power on/off pulses, is it also applicable to other
single byte commands? How are these commands named in the QCA
documentation?

In any case the comment about 'vendor power on and off pulse' should
be updated to refer to 'vendor commands'/'pulses' or whatever
terminology we decide to use.

The current name *might* be ok, depending on if we come up with
something better. If the QCA docs refer to them as 'vendor commands'
and there are no other multi-byte 'vendor commands' I'm fine with it.

Is the settling down of 100us specific to the power on/off pulses or
also applicable to other commands?

Thanks
