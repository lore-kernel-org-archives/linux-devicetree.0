I understand the issue now.
It's correct that we did not lock gpio_chip before calling gpio_request
after the gpio number is resolved.

I thought about adding a new API called of_gpio_request to hide the lock
to users like:
int of_gpio_request(..)
{
	spin_lock_irqsave(&gpio_lock, flags);
	ret = of_get_named_gpio(..);
	if (ret < 0)
		do_err..
	ret = gpio_request(..)

	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&gpio_lock, flags);
	return ret;
}
But it seems it does not work since the gpio_request may sleep and we may
need a new sleepable lock rather using the exist gpio_lock.

In the same time, i'm also thinking about a question that do we really
need to do this to protect gpio_chip being removed afer gpio number is
resolved?
My doubts is that gpio lib really does not block the gpiochip to be removed
before calling gpio_request, so why we need to do that for dt?
Maybe just let gpio_request to detect if gpio number is valid is already ok
for dt.

what's your suggestion on it?
