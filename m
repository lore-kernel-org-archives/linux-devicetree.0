This is the kind of patch that should be applied by the maintainers
for active platforms, where they have systems to test with and can
make sure you haven't regressed something on them.

For very low patch rate platforms we can apply directly through
maintainer acks, like in this case.

So, my recommendation is to repost the series to the maintainers.
Please don't patchbomb arm@kernel.org though, so keep us off of cc by
default (you can add our individual addresses if you want).


Thanks,
