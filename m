I can't think of anything that would make it unusable.
This auto diagnostic is really useful in cars where wires can get 
disconnected or shorted to ground.
In quieter environment it may not be as useful, and a test at startup 
may be sufficient.
Diagnostics can also be triggered at will.
Do you think a sysfs interface would be better suited to disable the 
autodiag ?

Thanks for your comment on the series.
