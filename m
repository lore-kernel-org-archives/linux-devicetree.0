Not setting the of_root pointer would do that. That should work.

Deprecated, not removed or disabled. It will still work pretty much
forever, but users should be encouraged to move to the reserve-memory
tree.

We could do that too.

Honestly though, I'm just unsure of what the best thing to do is. If you
and a few others tell me that, "no, exporting the raw dtb is the right
thing to do", then I'll be okay, merge the patch and sleep properly.

If you think my concerns have merit though, then say so and we'll do one
of the above.
