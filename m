Yes exactly. And this means that it always returns a particular type of
object, not something different depending on who calls it; this is
relevant to the discussion below.

Yes.

Well, .of_xlate is /defined/ as taking the of_phandle_args and returning
the DAI name that the of_phandle_args represents. If there's ever a need
to translate some of_phandle_args to something else, that should be a
different function.

To that end, perhaps calling the function .of_xlate_dai_name might be
more future-proof; if we ever needed to translate say a CODEC widget
name, we could add a separate .of_xlate_widget_name function to do that
later, with zero effect on the .of_xlate_dai_name function.

> Then can .of_xlate has *void pointer for return ?

I think it would always return a string; the function parameter would be
"char **dai_name".

It shouldn't. A GPIO driver's .of_xlate should /always/ take an
of_phandle_args, and translate it to a Linux (or perhaps chip-relative)
GPIO number, plus Linux GPIO flags. There should be nothing
driver-specific about the data it returns. The format of the device tree
cells that represent that data can be driver- (really, DT binding-)
specific; the whole point of the .of_xlate function is to translate that
binding-specific format into some standard internal Linux format.

As I mentioned above, that last parameter should be "char **dai_name",
and the function name probably of_xlate_dai_name.

No need to the ifdef; just provide a single definition which does one thing.

Yes, that's about right. Given how simple the implementation of
port_to_dai_name() is, I would simply write the code directly in the
implementation of of_xlate(). I assume you were writing pseudo-code
simply to avoid spelling out the implementation though.
