This patch set adds the SMEM nodes for the APQ8084 and MSM8916 platforms.  These
patches were originally part of:
https://lkml.org/lkml/headers/2015/9/24/561

I split these two patches out because these were the only DTS patches that
required modifications.  The rest have been accepted.  I continued to add the
previous change log for continuity sake.

Changes since v3:
- Moved smem node outside of soc and fixed up the rpm-msg-ram

Changes since v2:
- Fixed some missed review comments
- Corrected the SMD RPM example binding indentation

Changes since v1:
- Fixed various review comments
- Removed MSM8974 patches as there was already an outstanding patch
