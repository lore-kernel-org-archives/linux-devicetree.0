I take your point, but the reason I pushed this patch was that I wanted 
to use GPIO4 for pll-out and unfortunately because the pll-lock 
configuration is after the pll-out configuration it stomps on it. If I 
modify the patch to provide a default for pll-lock I will then be 
obliged to specify pll-lock on another GPIO. The pcm5122 has limited IO 
so being forced to have a GPIO for pll-lock seems wrong to me. A future 
user of the device may well decide to use the GPIOs for other purposes 
and therefore not want a pll-lock signal at all. Surely we should allow 
for that possibility?

Given that Peter has indicated that he'd be happy with this solution and 
that this code hasn't reached a published kernel would it be reasonable 
to go ahead with my current patch (happy to clean up the indent issues 
that Peter pointed out of course)?
