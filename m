Multiboot is pretty x86 specific (although MB2 has a MIPS port) and
covers more stuff than we strictly require (e.g. on x86 it has
requirements around which processor mode you enter in, has paging
enabled etc).

Kernel and initrd are written to /boot in the usual way (probably from
kernel.deb or whatever). Xen would also normally come from a distro
package (also in /boot).

It's in the bootloader config, e.g. boot.scr or grub.cfg, which are
either hand written or produced by the distros tooling.

grub on ARM could consume the same stanzas as are used by grub on x86 to
boot Xen (which are produced by update-grub):
        echo    'Loading Xen 4.1-amd64 ...'
        multiboot       /xen-4.1-amd64.gz placeholder  
        echo    'Loading Linux 3.10-2-amd64 ...'
        module  /vmlinuz-3.10-2-amd64 placeholder root=/dev/mapper/disks-root ro resume=/dev/mapper/disks-swap quiet
        echo    'Loading initial ramdisk ...'
        module  /initrd.img-3.10-2-amd64

Since there is no multiboot on ARM (and never will be) this is safe.

If multiboot ever does come to ARM it will necessarily be multiboot2
which uses a different keyword.

For u-boot Andre has proposed some syntactic sugar over the "fdt"
command to make boot.scr more trivial to use. We would of course need to
implement support for using it in the relevant distro tools (but they
tend to be very distro/machine specific already, e.g. Debian's
flash-kernel)

Right. The proposal is not for the OS to frob the DTB to support this
protocol but to configure the bootloader to do it.

Ian.
