The question is more about who actually wants the non-DT case.

Since this is a new driver, I suspect that the answer is "nobody",
as the existing board files are all for legacy platforms that we
are not going to adapt for this driver.

I see in the thread that at least Peter Chen was assuming the non-DT
case was still needed, but I can't find a reason for this in the code.
If we no longer care about that, the call to dev_get_platdata()
can also get removed.

Looking through the code some more, I also notice that it's using
a strange way of doing the abstraction: ci_hdrc_add_device()
actually creates a child device node, while the preferred way would
be to just call into ci_hdrc_probe(), or a generalized version of
that.
That should probably be changed, but can be done as a later cleanup.
