My point was that (part of) the intent of adding DT support to the
kernel was to get rid of all the board-specific code/churn in the
kernel. That's not really possible, since DT is just representing the
data about the HW (e.g. which GPIO/IRQ numbers) and not the behaviour.
In order to really remove signifcant board-specific code from the
kernel, you need to move behaviour out of the kernel too, i.e. hide it
behind some kind of firmware or virtualization interface, and hence
have simpler drivers that don't know all the details.

Yes, OpenFirmware might be another possible firmware interface. I
don't know anything about it...

I think much of that is already defined for a paravirt KVM guest
though, right?

True. Many/most(?) vendors work like that for most *products* though
already...

(Yes, I fully acknowledge there are many issues with
firmware/virtualization as a platform...)
