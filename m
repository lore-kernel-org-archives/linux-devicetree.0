So I guess you need to debug the code to see why that option isn't
working for you.

Going back to your original question above though, if the pinctrl-single
driver doesn't work out for you, then you'd need to create a custom
pinctrl driver for your chip, just like the many examples already in
drivers/pinctrl.
