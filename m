I think that my solution should work:
- the CODEC uses a pointer in the driver private data to the ELD.
- when get_modes() is called, this pointer is reset to NULL.
  (no audio streaming is permitted).
- this function reads the EDID and this asks for hardware exchanges
  with the HDMI device.
- the EDID is then translated to ELD and the ELD pointer is set
  (audio streaming is permitted again).

Then, if audio streaming is started before get_modes() is called, the
memory treatment of the ELD may be safely done during the harware
exchanges.

My patch just wants to offer basic audio to the TDA998x.
Especially, the display device state is of no importance: audio
streaming may continue while there is no connected device.

I know that, but I don't know enough about all the DRM and ASoC drivers
to propose a global mechanism.

OK. I'll stop here.

But there is no direct link (pointer) between the encoder and the
connector.
