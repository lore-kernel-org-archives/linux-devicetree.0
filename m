It really should be that from a device model/clock API point of view and
it certainly is with the patch proposed, the fact that it happens not to
have been is just a product of the poor clock support in Linux than
anything else.

I'm not sure where you see the CODEC going off and deciding the MCLK
rate itself here?  Essentially all that's happening here is that
set_sysclk() is behaving like the clock API does and setting its own
rate to what it was explicitly asked to set, including bouncing that
request up the chain.

The rounding could go if we wanted to be a bit stricter - if the machine
driver is doing a good job it should never change anything - but
otherwise I just can't see what you're concerned about.

What you're describing seems to make things worse not better for your
problem?  I'm sorry, I just can't follow what you're concerned about
here at all. =20

The current situation is that the CODEC just gets told what it should
run SYSCLK at, all the patch does really is factor out the code to call
clk_set_rate() on a programmable parent clock and look that clock up in
DT.  Both before and after the patch the CODEC driver takes no decisions
on the rate.  If we started doing things in hw_params() the CODEC driver
would have to start taking decisions since it would only get the sample
rate and so on provided.
