Actually nothing in otg.c is specific to OTG except one function 
otg_state_string(). So we should ideally have all the list and spinlock 
stuff be moved to phy.c

Some of them got added recently (like devm_usb_get_phy_by_phandle). It 
should be in 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git usb-next

*dr_mode* doesn't look like it should be in phy/ or otg/. You can keep 
it as is in core/of.c
