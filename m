The main reason is that out of principle I want to get to the point where
every ARMv6 and ARMv7 machine is part of CONFIG_ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM.

Then again, once we introduce CONFIG_BROKEN_MULTIPLATFORM, we could
have an option that depends on that, and turns on both
ARM_DMA_MEM_BUFFERABLE as well as the hack to remove the outer_sync
from mb() and wmb() for CONFIG_SMP.
