Hi Stephen,

I forgot to answer one of your questions:

I tried to work on that but the device does not get probed because the
parent node (pmc) does not register its children. We would need to
modify the DT to add such a support and break DT compat.

As we are speaking about getting rid of clk subnodes (c.f. Rob and
Alexandre answers on the first version of this patch series:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9805991/) in favor of a clock
controller node that would break the DT compat as well, IMHO it would be
best to break the DT compat as few times as possible and thus, rework
this driver once we switch to a clock controller node.

Thanks,
Quentin
