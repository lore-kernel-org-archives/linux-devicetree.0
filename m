Hmm, I know, It does not make sense to keep these patches locally 
waiting for something to change in future, Am not sure when those new 
changes be actually merged into the mainline?

IMHO, we should merge this patches as they are perfectly applicable to 
whats on linus-tree. And fix if required when the new design is accepted.

I will investigate on this and see If I can add some more useful 
contents to the nodes.
