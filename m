Looking at the kernel configuration, it seems like SAMA5D2 platform
selects CONFIG_PM (Wenyou, please confirm). So, it seems like the only
users of this driver always have CONFIG_PM enabled.

So I guess the best way is to maintain the current code for pm_runtime_*
and move the clock enable/disable to pm_runtime callbacks.

Something like this:

m_can_runtime_resume()
{
	clk_prepare_enable(cclk);
	clk_prepare_enable(hclk);
}

m_can_runtime_suspend()
{
	clk_disable_unprepare(cclk);
	clk_disable_unprepare(hclk);
}

SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS(m_can_runtime_suspend, m_can_runtime_resume, NULL)

static void m_can_start(struct net_device *dev)
{
	pm_runtime_get_sync(dev)
	...
}

static void m_can_stop(struct net_device *dev)
{
	...
	pm_runtime_put_sync(dev)
}

Does that sound okay? If yes, I will go work on the implementation.

Thanks,
Faiz
