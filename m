I understand your concern, but why are you answering while I asked for
DT maintainers reviews for several days (if not several weeks).

We already discussed that with Rob and Thomas, and hiding such a
demuxer chip is not an easy task.
I'm open to any suggestion to do that, though I'd like you (I mean DT
guys) to provide a working implementation (or at least a viable concept)
that would silently demultiplex an irq.

Yes, but do you have anything else to propose.
We're experiencing this warning for 2 releases now, and this is time to
find a solution (even if it's not a perfect one).

I first proposed to make this field unlimited, but Thomas suggested to
keep it limited to 32 bits (and I didn't complain since my HW needs
far less than 32 interrupts).

Boris
