These empty discussions aren't anything new either.  If we just keep on
endlessly going through the basics over and over again without any
associated code this just reinforces the perception that people are more
focused on talking than on actually accomplishing anything.  Lengthy
reiterations of design discussions won't move things forwards.

This is why I keep asking you to review and engage with the prior
discussion or to do concrete things to improve the situation.

Do you see any specific issues here?  It sounds like you're perfectly
aware of what the bindings are supposed to be doing with routing signals
to and from CODECs and have found some errors but you haven't told us
what those are.

Like I keep saying, do concrete things to move things forwards.

To repeat myself yet again: what is done to the CODEC here is system
dependent.  This includes interaction with other components in the
system.
