List-Id: devicetree@vger.kernel.org

Add initial device trees for UDOO Neo Basic, Extended and Full boards.
Serial console is enabled, other serial ports are prepared.
Both user LEDs are enabled, with the orange one reserved for the M4.
I2C based PMIC is enabled. Ethernet is enabled for Basic and Full.
