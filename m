we can do this. However all pcm-* are optional if you switch the HCI transport. And sco-routing should default to HCI if that is not present. Meaning a driver should actively trying to change this. Nevertheless, it would be good if a driver reads the current settings.

In theory we could make sco-routing generic, but so many vendors have different modes, that we better keep this vendor specific.

Regards

Marcel
