I'm not sure I agree; see below.

As a general statement, yes.

Yes.

OK.

Just a note: Tegra30 also has per-pin muxability. Only Tegra20 muxes pins
in groups. (although Tegra30 does some if its pin configuration in groups)

This is where I disagree.

If the pinmux_map should only contain a single entry, wouldn't the DT
mux property only contain a single entry?

The reason being that if there's a single entry in the pinmux_map, the
group name used in that entry must be a group that's supported directly
by the pinctrl driver (that's just the way pinctrl works). As such, why
not just write the device tree in terms of those groups?

The only way I can see this not being true is if your pinctrl driver is
also parsing these mux properties, and dynamically creating the groups
that it exposes based on the list of pins in the mux property. However,
that seems like the wrong approach; If you're dynamically defining groups
in DT, I'd expect separate explicit driver-specific properties/nodes to
define those groups, such that the pinctrl core's processing of the mux
property to be identical in all cases.

i.e. instead of what your "mux-unit" proposal:

    pmx_sdhci: pinconfig-sdhci {
        mux =
            <TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTA TEGRA_PMX_MUX_SDIO1>
            <TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTD TEGRA_PMX_MUX_SDIO1>;
        mux-unit = "pingroup";
        mux-name = "sdio-config-1";
    };

I'd expect something more like:

    /* Standardized pinctrl properties */
    pmx_sdhci: pinconfig-sdhci {
        mux = <IMX_PG_SDIO_CFG_1 IMX_MUX_SDIO1>;
    };

    /*
     * Driver-specific properties which tell the driver which potentially
     * board-specific pin-groups to implement.
     */
    imx-pingroup-sdio-cfg-1 {
        id = <IMX_PG_SDIO_CFG_1>;
        pins = <IMX_PIN_SDIO1_CLK IMX_PIN_SDIO1_CMD IMX_PIN_SDIO1_DAT0...>;
    };

Does that make sense?
