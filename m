Hello.

   Here's the set of 11 patches against Simon Horman's 'renesas.git' repo's
'renesas-devel-20161003-v4.8' tag. I'm adding the device tree support for
the R8A7743-based SK-RZG1M board. The SoC is close to R8A7791 and the board
seems identical to the R8A7791/Porter board. The device tree patches depend on
the R8A7743 CPG/MSSR driver series just posted in order to compile and work.
