... it doesn't. Its a host address from the constant pool which is used by
hyp-panic as __host_ctxt:
> void __hyp_text __noreturn hyp_panic(struct kvm_cpu_context *__host_ctxt);

and fixed up with:
> host_ctxt = kern_hyp_va(__host_ctxt);

to give us the EL2 address before we access it.
For VHE the last step is a nop as the host address can be accessed directly.

I will add a comment here explaining this.


Thanks!
