[Bala]: in QCA wcn3990 for these two bytes we will turn off the flow 
control while sending command and turn on back once it is enabled.
         in documentation it was mentioned as power on and power off 
pulse.
         for all other single bytes we need flow control enable.

[Bala]: will update the the function name.
