commit 5fe156f1cab4 ("regulator: pfuze100: add enable/disable
for switch") will cause those unreferenced switches being
turned off if "regulator-always-on" is NOT present, as
pfuze switches are normally used by critical modules which
must be always ON or shared by many peripherals which
do NOT implement power domain control, so just make sure
all switches always ON to avoid any system issue caused
by unexpectedly turning off switches.
