Thanks for your suggestion!

I also curious why this one appended byte is needed as it seems the later
acpi_set_current_resources() doesn't use this byte.
And I tested without setting the buffer->length as the length of resource list
directly, it seems ok.

But anyway, it looks more reasonable to allocate the memory with the
buffer->length rather than buffer->length - 1;

I was made the V9 patch-set, and I can add your suggestion there. But I also
awaiting for ARM64 ACPI maintainer's comment about this patch before really
sending V9. I wonder whether there is better way to make our indirect-IO devices
can be assigned the logic PIO before the enumeration...

Lorenzo, Hanjun, what do you think about this patch?

Thanks,
Zhichang
