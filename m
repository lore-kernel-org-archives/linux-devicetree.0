Now that Lars-Peter pointed me to the right direction, it seems there is 
a proper way to deal with issue after all.

Continuing this tought. I wonder if it would be better to introduce a 
new compatible match for each new card, with some clever way to manage 
the accumulating matches in the code, and hard code DAI-link 
configurations for each match. This way the old configurations would not 
be carved to stone in the old dtbs.

As there is a proper way to deal with this, I'll look into that first. 
However, if there still is a need for these properties I am happy to 
finish the patch.

Best regards,
