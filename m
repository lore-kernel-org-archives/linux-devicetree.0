That is how I remember it as well ... the default opp table is supposed to 
contain only the safest of values, while individual boards can then increase 
those in conjunction with their thermal design.

As the evb itself does only have the naked soc without any heat-sink or 
similar, I'm not even sure if these additional frequencies should be enabled 
there at all.
