Well, the issue at hand is about things that share an IRQ with a timer AFAICS.

That is odd enough already and I'd say everyone in that situation needs to
be prepared to take the pain (including having to check if the device is not
suspended in their interrupt handlers).

And quite frankly they need to do that already, because we've never suspended
timer IRQs.

Something like IRQF_"I can share the line with a timer" I guess?  That wouldn't
hurt and can be checked at request time even.

Right.
