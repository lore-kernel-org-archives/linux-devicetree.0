Thinking about all of this put together with the general comments, would the
following be more acceptable:

- Keep the approach of this patch series with having the heaps specified
in an array in a file
- For each array of heaps, have a list of machine compatible strings that
work with the heaps.
- Call of_machine_is_compatible on all the heaps until one is found
- When setting up the heaps, check for a property like Rob suggested
to get the appropriate memory node
- Add appropriate documentation in the devicetree directory explaining
the entire approach

The only Ion data in the DT with this approach would be the property in the
appropriate memory node. There is no ABI except the memory property so as
Ion changes there would be no breakage. This approach does go a little
bit out outside of the traditional way devicetree works. A more
traditional approach would be to just have an ion node with a compatible
string and then just find the memory node via a property (although this
does taint the DT more with Ion even if the ABI may be relatively stable)

Thanks,
Laura
