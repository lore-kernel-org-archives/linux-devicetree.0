Sorry, I'm not familiar with ST nomenclature.
So that should become the name of the interconnect/bus.

A power domain driver can do anything it wants.
That includes enabling your interconnect clocks, and keeping them enabled.

Now, if flexgen is the name of the clock source, then all devices connected
to flexgen are part of the flexgen clock domain, which can be represented
in Linux using the generic PM domain. Do all devices connected to flexgen
need to be handled similarly w.r.t. clocks? If yes, the genpd may be the place
to implement that.
