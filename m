Hi Philipp,

sorry for the late answer; I'm quite busy with other stuff these days.

The tfp410 can be operated either in i2c mode or in dump mode (i2c is 
not wired up). The Linux driver does only support dump mode so far. (In 
essence the driver does nothing but the neccesary boilerplate stuff.) 
While the format can be read and changed neither is possible in the dumb 
mode. The format is configured by connecting some pins of the chip to 
ground. So we have to deal with the "otherwise" case below.

I see your point that the format is a property of the wiring and, thus, 
it is better to utilizie the bus-width property in the of graph remote 
nodes from a modelling point of view.

On the other hand, the parallel-display already has some data on the 
wiring: the pinctrl settings. This weakens the above reasoning because 
the information is splitted up. Moreover, a quick grep session revealed 
that on all arm platforms the format is obtained from the "SoC-side" 
(read parallel-display) node, if it is dynamic. Is there some effort to 
change that? (essentially, I'm trying to understand here the 
justification for the change we are discussing).

Cheers,
Christopher
