Sure, we're just juggling different descriptions for the same thing here.
The fact that our different representations do seem to agree on that
is reassuring...

Absolutely: I didn't argue this very well.

The CPU's-eye view of the system determines a natural hierarchy for
everything or almost.

It's possible that there is some bus or switch that only non-CPUs
can see.  But if the CPU has no control interface for it, that
suggests that bus is transparent enough that it needs no control --
and might not need to be represented in the DT at all.

As a rule, we should never put anything in the DT that does not
need to be described.

But if we end up with deviations from this rule, floating nodes
give us an escape route.

Suppose you have a cluster of DSPs used to implement a GPU.  They
might have their own front-side bus which they control themselves.
In this situation, it might be more natural to represent that whole
side cluster as a separate floating subtree within /.

But that's all very hypothetical.  In most cases, you just call
that monstrosity "gpu" and make it look like a device -- even in
the hardware.

You're right that this is a change.  However, I think that no existing
DT needs to change, and few DTs will use it -- similar to the argument
about why DT will normally look like a single tree.

In real systems, I think multi-master slaves which are accessed
directly and not via some multi-master shared bus are not that common.

A partial dodge would be to introduce a dummy bus node:

	a {
		b {
			reg = < REG >;
		};
	};

becomes

	a {
		slave-ranges = < &b_bus RANGE >;
	};

	b_bus {
		// #slave-cells = <0> is the default
		compatible = "simple-bus";

		b {
			reg = < REG' >;
		};
	};

Where RANGE maps REG into a's address space, and REG' is REG rebased
to address 0.

Now, we can refer indirectly to b as many times as we like, without
using the slave-reg thing.

This still needs special parsing though -- but again, only for cases
that we already can't describe with DT.


The common situation will be that all shared slaves are really under
some shared bus, and that bus really has some natural location in
the DT.  So for cases simple enough not to require these extensions,
I think there would still be no change.

Those problems aren't identical, but they seem closely related.

My thought was that this gives us most of the language required to
describe the mastering links for bus-mastering devices.

The idea that some things are properties of and edge or link, not a
node or device, overlaps with my thinking about IOMMU.  This may
apply to any device that behaves like some adaptor or passthrough.

One option is to create subnodes for these links.  I did not elaborate
this previously, but I think allowing "slave" to be a node for the
more complex cases where we need to add more info might help here:

	dma {
		slave {
			compatible = "slave-link", "simple-bus";
			ranges = < ... >;
			iommu-foo = < ... >;

			slave = < &shared_bus SLAVE-PORT >;
		}
	};

The best way to describe multiple master ports on the DMA controller
would need some thought.


One option would to extend the address space on the slave node with
additional cell(s) to carry port identifiers.  ePAPR already does
things in this sort of way in the interrupt-map and interrupt-map-mask
properties, to describe PCI interrupt routing.

Indeed.  I was impressed to see a non-trivial block diagram that wasn't
pasted straight out of some marketing powerpoint :)

It's a good example for discussion here, particularly if we add some
IOMMUs to the mix.

You mean the ACP port connecting the PL Fabric back to the CPU cluster?
I'm guessing the PL Fabric is the interface to the FPGA logic.


Now I need to go back to your proposal and the IOMMU thread and try to
understand better how the approaches map onto each other.
