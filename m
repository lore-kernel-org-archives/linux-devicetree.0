I am okay with that if Mike is; however, personally I think
CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED is pretty descriptive.  If clocks are unused
(reference count reaches zero) the framework will disable the clock --
fair enough.  So in order to prevent that from happening in cases
where these clocks are used by entities other than device drivers
(perhaps these devices are even invisible to Linux) we have to tell
the framework to "ignore the fact that this clock _appears_ to be
unused".  Hence CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED.

I'm struggling to think of a solid reason for inventing new flags when
we have one that is perfectly suitable/descriptive.
