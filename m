This patch set introduces the dmaengine driver for the Qualcomm Bus Access
Manager (BAM) DMA controller present on MSM 8x74 devices.  A number of the
on-chip devices have their own BAM DMA controller and use it to move data
between system memory and peripherals or between two peripherals.

The initial version of this driver will only support slave DMA operations
between system memory and peripherals.

Changes from v1:
        - Converted driver to use virt-dma
        - Reworked probe function per review comments
        - tx_status function now computes and returns residuals
        - Removed proprietary slave config.  Removed associated include file.
        - Renamed files to reflect vendor name instead of specific device
	- Converted to use (readl|writel)_relaxed w/ appropriate barriers
	- Removed unions in favor of standard types.
