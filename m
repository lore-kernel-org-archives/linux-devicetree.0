No.

Copy&pasting your comment N times does not make it any more valid. My
files, my rules - I insist on vega-s95, gxbb and gx, which you guys
refactored out from my gxbb, to be tidy.

Negative, that means any additions and changes for the reference boards
will slip through into boards that you do not test.

We've already seen how "well" that works with R-Box Pro having inherited
a broken U-Boot network configuration due to internal vs. external PHY.

If Kevin is the maintainer, then he needs to carefully review patches.
It is not my job to review all patches when BayLibre gets paid for it!

Isn't the historical SoC order S905X before S905D?

Otherwise your strict interpretation leads to meson-gxbb before meson8,
which seems unlogical to me.

See the gxbb patch for why that statement is wrong.

Also note that not cleaning up an existing mess and making it worse are
two things.

I will also remind that I was forced to clean up the node order in ALL
exynos5250 .dts files before I could get my new exynos5250-spring.dts
merged, so I have zero understanding about these "churn" and "live with
it" comments here. The same rules need to apply to all (that's égalité
for you!), BayLibre is not above everyone else.

Regards,
Andreas
