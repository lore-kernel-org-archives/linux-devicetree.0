The base address 0x100000D8 is defined in jz4780.dtsi file.
REG_RNG_CTRL and REG_RNG_DATA are offsets. In jz4780_rng_readl and
jz4780_rng_writel functions the ioremap'd base address is added with
offset.

I can calculate the speed and make sure the delay is met in the
driver. Thanks a lot for providing this info.

Looking at JZ4780 Programmers manual I could not find any info about
VCC. Can you point me to it?
