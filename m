I understood this point. Please, allow me to clarify below, as I've
evidently not done a good job so far.

That's not quite what I said. What I said was that whether or not you
end up with coherency depends on the kernel's configuration. That's why
I pointed out that in practice, the only cases that work with today's
mainline kernels are this for which the devices which are coherent with
the kernel's usual memory attributes in an SMP configuration.

If you grep for dma-coherent in arch/arm/boot/dts, you'll find that
appears in:

arch/arm/boot/dts/artpec6.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/ecx-common.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/ls1021a.dtsi

Which are all SMP Cortex-{A7,A9,A15} platforms, and:

arch/arm/boot/dts/k2e.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/k2e-netcp.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/k2hk-netcp.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/k2l-netcp.dtsi
arch/arm/boot/dts/keystone.dtsi

For which, as far as I am aware, the dma-coherent property does not
yield coherency with a mainline kernel, due to the requirement of Outer
Shareable attributes.

So, if we codify the dma-coherent semantics as only matching the working
case today, then it becomes consistent and independent of kernel
configuration, and we can add properties to cater for the other cases,
independent of kernel configuration.

Yes. This is a problem, but one that we already face. If we clarified
the semantics as above, we would know that the device is simply not
coherent.

I hope that I've clarified my position w.r.t. coherence vs specification
thereof. :)

I think that at minimum, the attributes devices require needs to be
describe to the kernel, rather than being something we hope just
happened to match.

Unfortunately, I think everything in this area leads to confusion. :(

Thanks,
Mark.
