I wouldn't use a property at all.  Why not use the compatible string?

Who chooses the naming scheme of the firmware binary?

Is there any reason they can't be:

  fdma_STiH407_audio.elf
  fdma_STiH407_app.elf
  fdma_STiH407_free_running.elf

Then you can have a different compatible for each:

  compatible =3D "st,stih407-fdma-mpe31-audio";
  compatible =3D "st,stih407-fdma-mpe31-app";
  compatible =3D "st,stih407-fdma-mpe31-free-running";

Yes.
