Ok.

Right so we can simply insert simplefbvdd1-supply, simplefbvdd2-supply, etc.
regulator nodes into the simplefb node, and have the simplefb kernel code look
for supplies with a name of simplefb_vdd%d in a loop until it fails to find one.

Note that the foo-supply names are local to the simplefb node, these do not
need to be the same as the ones in the nodes describing the actual hardware
blocks. Not having an array is somewhat inconvenient, but easily worked around
and once worked around this really is just the same problem as with clocks.

That is simply not true, I'm fully aware that we may eventually need other
resources, e.g. regulators. I just want to take this one step at a time,
I really believe that once we have this figured out for one resource, it
becomes a lot easier to also figure out for other resources.

The key word here being resources. We need to figure out how to do
resource management for simplefb, once we have that figured out for one
resource, the others can follow the same "design-pattern". As the long
thread about the clocks support has shown, getting consensus on this
with only one resource in play already is hard enough, so baby steps
is the way to go.
