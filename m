SMC/HVC is synchronously(block) running in "secure mode", i.e, there
can only be one instance running platform wide. Right?  That implies
there is only one physical channel in the platform. So if you need to
initiate different functions (tx, rx), you call them sequentially by
changing the func-id for each request. Why not?
