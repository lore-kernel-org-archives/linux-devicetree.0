Yeah, we really need to unify all this.

Well, the dts doesn't really need to describe how Linux is using things.
I'd like to get to common DT code for sp804 so all platforms just have a
call to sp804_dt_init() which does all the initialization.

That doesn't distinguish clk-event vs. clk-source. Perhaps we can use
presence of interrupt to distinguish that. It shouldn't really matter
which timer Linux picks as long as the h/w has the necessary features.
We just need to make sure dts describes those features. Some of the
things we have to deal with:

Highbank has interrupt for timer0, but not on timer1, so timer0 must be
clk-event. It also users timer1 for sched clock, but ARM Ltd platforms
use a different timer.

Realview and Versatile use timer0 for clk-event and timer3 for clk-src.
Is there something broken with timer1 and timer2? It is certainly
possible the h/w has the clock tied off for 1 of the 2 timers.

VExpress CA9 has broken timers on the core tile (at least they were
ifdef'ed out before the last clean-up). We could just remove/disable
them in the dts so they are not used.
