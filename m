I think this restriction should be documented in the DT binding more clearly,
as adding a "clk-always-on" node prohibits you from handling the clock
correctly in
the future.

Still, for simple devices where you don't have a driver, but have "predictable"
bindings (e.g. a bus like "simple-pm-bus"), I think it's better to add
a device node
for that simple device now, incl. a reference to the clock, and have a simple
driver that binds to the device, or platform code that looks for a
compatible node,
and enables the clock. That way you don't have to make any chances to the DTS
later, when you'll have a real driver.
