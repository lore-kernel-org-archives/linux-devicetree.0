Actually I'm currently thinking in a different direction, which I
think will be good for the boards where some ICs are frequently
replaced by 2nd (and 3th and 4th) sources, rather then that we're
dealing with an extension connector with capes / daughter boards.

Although there is some overlap I'm starting to think that we need to
treat these 2 cases differently. Let me quickly copy and paste
the basic idea I've for the 2nd source touchscreen / accelerometer
chip case:

"""
The kernel actually already has a detect() method in struct i2c_driver,
we could use that (we would need to implement it in drivers which do not
have it yet). Note on second thought it seems it may be better to use
probe() for this, see below.

Then we could have something like this in dt:

&i2c0 {
     touchscreen1: gsl1680@40 {
         reg = <0x40>;
         compatible = "silead,gsl1680";
         enable-gpios = <&pio 7 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PH1 */
         status = "disabled";
     };

     touchscreen2: ektf2127@15 {
         reg = <0x15>;
         compatible = "elan,ektf2127";
         enable-gpios = <&pio 7 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PH1 */
         status = "disabled";
     };

     i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match-0 = <&touchscreen1>, <&touchscreen2>;
     i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match-1 = <&accelerometer1>, <&accelerometer2>;
}

Which would make the i2c subsys call detect (*) on each device, until
a device is found. Likewise we could have a "i2c-probe-all" property
which also walks a list of phandles but does not stop on the first
match.

...

*) Yes this sounds Linux specific, but it really is just "execute to-be-probed
device compatible specific detection method"
"""

This does not 100% solve all q8 issues (see the "Add Allwinner Q8 tablets
hardware manager" thread), but does solve quite a bit of the use-case
and this matches what many vendor os-images (typically android) are
actually doing for these kind of boards.

As for the bits this does not solve, those are mostly board specific details
which cannot be probed at all, and on x86 are typically solved in the device
driver by doing a dmi check to identify the board and then apply a board
specific workaround in the driver.

I've come to believe that we should similarly delegate dealing this to device
drivers in the devicetree case. Note that dt should still of course fully
describe the hardware for normal hardware, the driver would just need to care
about weird board quirks in certain exceptions.

A more interesting problem here is that dt does not have something like
DMI, there is the machine compatible, but that typically does not contain
board revision info (where as DMI often does). I believe that this is
actually something which should be fixed at the bootloader level
have it prepend a new machine compatible which contains revision info.

Hmm, if we make the bootloader prepend a new machine compatible which contains
revision info, we could then trigger quirks on this and in some cases avoid
the need for dealing with board quirks in the driver ...

Note this is all very specific to dealing with board (revision) variants,
for add-ons having the bootloader add info to the machine compatible does
not seem the right solution.

Regards,

Hans
