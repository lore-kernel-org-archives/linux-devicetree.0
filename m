I need to send out a new version that drops aux value/mask from
device-tree. However, as is it won't help much with the above code
because of the extra register setup. Perhaps I can add the following
bindings:

tag-ram-latency = <>;
data-ram-latency = <>;
filter-ranges = <start end>;

Any comments on these? Is there anything already defined in this area
for latency/waitstates? I'll have to go back and check, but I think
these are all pl310 specific.
