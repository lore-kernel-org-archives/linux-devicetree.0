My bad, I meant "This 'is not' inline with the ARM..."

Right, which is why our old secure monitor is not inline with the SMCCC,
it uses r12 and not r0.

Not at the same time, our old secure monitor is in ROM, it will be
present anytime OP-TEE is not installed. OP-TEE is not mandatory, and so
any call to the secure side must be safe for both secure monitors.

The current monitor is part of ROM and dates back to OMAP3 days, so
looks to pre-date ARM standardizing the SMCCC by several years, so I
hope our lack of compliance here can be forgiven here..

Luckily, OP-TEE does not have to move away from compliance to support
our platforms, it only needs to check for this sentinel value in r12,
which it already has support upstream for:

https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/blob/master/core/arch/arm/plat-ti/sm_platform_handler_a15.c#L34

This particular case should never happen as we only add the OP-TEE DT
node after having installed OP-TEE during boot. It is listed here only
for completeness and to show that it is safe even if it did occur.

Correct.

This might not be possible, these old SMCs are made very early and are
used all over our existing platform code:

git grep "smc" -- arch/arm/mach-omap2

All systems have the old monitor by default, OP-TEE is the new and
optional case, I think its node should be the entity modified when
adding something OP-TEE specific like this.

I agree this would be nice, but due to the above this may simply not be
reasonably possible.
