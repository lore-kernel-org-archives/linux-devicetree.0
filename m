Hello.

   Here's the set of 12 patches against Simon Horman's 'renesas.git' repo,
'renesas-devel-20160926-v4.8-rc8' tag. I'm adding the device tree support for
the R8A7743-based SK-RZG1M board. The SoC is close to R8A7791 and the board
seems  identical to the R8A7791/Porter board. This version includes the Ether,
so the board should boot with NFS root now. I tried to address all the comments
to the version 1 (except the need to use the new CPG/MSSR drivers -- this one
will be addressed RSN). The DMAC/SCIF/IRQC bindings patches posted recently are
needed for scripts/checkpatch.pl to be happy. :-)
