Actually, I just discovered something odd in the
arch/arm/mach-spear/spear13xx-dma.h file that gets removed
in the last patch: there, we define request numbers up to
32, e.g.

-       SPEAR1310_DMA_REQ_UART2_RX = 14,
-       SPEAR1310_DMA_REQ_UART2_TX = 15,
-       SPEAR1310_DMA_REQ_UART5_RX = 16,
-       SPEAR1310_DMA_REQ_UART5_TX = 17,

What is the meaning of this, if the maximum request number is 15?

Ok. Would it be enough to have only one master and one request
field in the DT dma descriptor then, and have the code figure
whether to use it as source or destination, based on the
configuration? Which one should come first? Since you have
multiple masters per controller, and multiple requests per
master, it sounds like the cleanest descriptor form would
be 

	<controller master request>;

Or possibly

	<controller master request direction>;

if the direction needs to be known at the time the channel
is requested.
