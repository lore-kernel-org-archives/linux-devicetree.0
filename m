Then perhaps that is a case for a middle CS node. Or you can have 2
nodes on same CS with different offsets:

dev@0,0 {};
dev@0,10000 {};
dev@1,0 {};

I guess either timing props get duplicated or you designate the first
node has them (2 devices on the same CS need to have the same timing
or have s/w setup per access).

Maybe so, but I'm trying to bring some consistency here, so I'd
suggest looking at newer ones like atmel IIRC.

Between the 3 choices, what I've said is obviously my 1st choice. This
one would be 2nd (though chipselect should be part of the address
translation as Arnd suggested). The one above would be last.
