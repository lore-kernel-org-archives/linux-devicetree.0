This is why I don't really like the concept of generic pinconf; it ends
up being more: whoever defines something first imposes their SoCs'
viewpoint on that feature/property, and then everything else is declared
non-generic.

In many cases, I think bindings will need to add SoC-specific properties
beyond generic pinconf (or perhaps only use SoC-specific properties and
ignore generic pinconf).

In the case of deglitch here, perhaps that's the best answer.
