Anything that an end-user has to tweak shouldn't be in DT. A board should be able to ship with a dtb and a user should be able to change settings without changing the dtb.

Agreed. I'm saying because of that, that's not really a strong argument that those platforms also need your proposal.

No, I like the OMAP way. However, their properties are properties of the h/w, not how you want to use them.

If the timer can be a pwm, then it should have a #pwm-cells property. Then don't use timers with #pwm-cells property.

Kernel command line is fine for me.
