Yes, cut/paste mistake.

The comment applies to both gpio-values-idle at the top-level, and the
reg values within each of the mux's I2C child busses.

In this binding, I assume that the reg value in the I2C child bus is the
value mux->data.values[i] in the driver code, and gpio-values-idle is
value mux->data.idle. That way, we don't need each child bus to have a
separate property to represent mux->data.values[i]. If we don't want to
overload reg this way, perhaps we could represent child busses as:

i2c@0 {
    reg = <0>; /* arbitrary ID */
    gpio-values = <1>; /* Value determined by HW mux's GPIO values */
    ...
};
i2c@1 {
    reg = <1>;
    gpio-values = <2>;
    ...
};
