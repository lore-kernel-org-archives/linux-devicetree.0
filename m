Is this a pull request for v3.4 or not? I'm willing to take it and have put
it into next/dt2 for now so it makes it into linux-next. I'm not taking
a newer version for v3.4 any more, so if anyone has concerns over some of
your patches in the series, it all gets removed again and we will have to
postpone them until v3.5.

Note that it would have been better to base your series on top of just
the kirkwood/board branch rather than all of next/boards, but it's not
a big deal.
