The patch

   regulator: arizona-ldo1: Avoid potential memory leak reading init_data

has been applied to the regulator tree at

   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/regulator.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] regulator: arizona-ldo1: Avoid potential memory leak reading
 init_data

The device argument passed to of_get_regulator_init_data is used to
do some devres memory allocation. Currently the driver passes the MFD
device pointer to this function, this could result in the init_data
allocation being leaked if the regulator is unbound but the MFD isn't.

Correct this issue by correctly passing the local platform device.
