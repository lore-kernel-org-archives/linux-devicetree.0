Sorry to be picky, but I checked the original postings of the first rev
and V3 and they didn't appear to be CC'd. The mailing list was, but not
the people. I guess Grant did comment on the first rev though. He didn't
give an opinion on the DT binding that I can find.

Yes, (4) is my concern.

Honestly, I don't know if it's likely. It's certainly theoretically
possible. Either way though, I'd rather the kernel explicitly drive the
signal in the fashion that the specific HW expects it to be driven,
rather than wiggling the GPIO in a way that by luck happens to work for
a variety of disparate requirements.

Anyway, I've made my opinion clear. Whoever would merge this patch can
choose to ignore it or not.
