Ah, so you are interested in boot loaders that can be scripted to do
what you had in mind but cannot be scripted to add or modify a DT
property. I hadn't considered that, but you are probably right that
this is at least 90% of the systems you'd find in the wild today.

Thinking this a bit further, I wonder if (at least upstream) u-boot
has a way to modify DT properties in a scripted way that would allow
the direct property. It sounds like a generally useful feature not
just for randomness, so if that doesn't already work, maybe someone
can implement it. In the simplest case, you'd only need to find the
address of an existing property in the dtb and load a file to
that location.
