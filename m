But what if the h/w has quirks you haven't yet discovered? You need the
compatible property to be specific now, so if there are any future
driver changes needed the DT does not have to change (as it may be in
firmware which you can't change).

The binding docs should be independent of the driver. There may be
fields the driver ignores. So you need to document all defined
compatible strings. It is fine if the driver only has "usb-ehci", but it
is not fine for the DT to only have that.
