Well, if you look at prior versions, it was separate being in
drivers/of/. I'm not sure we want to encourage/allow not converting to
COMMON_CLK. I would consider not using COMMON_CLK is deprecated. Having
a single definition of struct clk is the primary reason for COMMON_CLK.
What is the reason for not converting mmp to COMMON_CLK? It appears to
be a pretty trivial clock implementation, and will be required for
multi-platform kernels.

This depends on 1 as the common clock code would have the same issue.
Generally, the first place clocks are needed is the timer init. At that
point, you can call kzalloc. This is where all the clock init used to be
done until init_early was added and some platforms have moved their
clock init. I don't think there was really ever much reason to move it
other than to make the timer init function only deal with timer setup.

Is alloc_bootmem available on all arches? There's 3 occurrences in
drivers/* which tells me that is the wrong thing to do.
