As I said, whether we have a virtual node or not is a minor part of
having some consistency in bindings and was the only part Grant
discussed. We have though diverged from the specific problems with
this binding which is that it invents yet another way to describe the
relationship between components. The use of DRM component names in the
binding properties is the first clue. As to what is the "right" way,
well if that is known or documented I've seen no evidence. Defining
what that is and having the infrastructure in place to support it is
what I'm interested in.
