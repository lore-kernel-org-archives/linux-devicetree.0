I think the patch looks OK technically, except for one minor comment below.

One issue with this patch is that it moves *.dts from arch/arm/boot to
arch/arm/boot/dts, which means everyone has to adjust their scripts/...
that package/install/... the kernel. I guess it's an easy change for
people to make, but could easily catch people unawares if they do
incremental builds so that arch/arm/boot/*.dtb still exists but is stale.

Doesn't that make the "dtbs" target always run by default? Perhaps
that's reasonable though, and doesn't actually affect anything since the
make command for this directory always specifies an explicit target?

Or, was that meant to be the following that got removed from ../Makefile?

targets += $(dtb-y)
