Done.  I've actually reworked this a lot, and pulled all the
clock (and interconnect) related code into a separate source file.
No more forward declarations (there anyway), and the work structure
is now embedded in the top-level IPA structure so I can derive
it again in the work function (rather than using the global).

Working on this.

I should probably have added at least a comment here.  The
DMA memory was zeroed at the time of allocation.  That zero
buffer is then referred to in the payload to the HDR_INIT_LOCAL
immediate command.  So that command, when executing in the IPA
hardware, uses the contents of the buffer whose physical address
it's supplied, which in this case is full of zeroes.  We don't
use the virtual address because the buffer came pre-zeroed.

Based on your comment elsewhere I will be putting the command
payload in a structure on the stack rather than allocating it
dynamically.

Yes, this was obviously a debug message in some code I should
have removed before sending...

The IPA context is in fact a global, static structure at
the moment.  All of this bookkeeping (zeroing out things)
is a habitual practice, basically.  Regardless your point
is good and I'll remove these kinds of things as part of
converting to not using globals.

Yes.  I've done this for my own use, but the code is not
currently able to shut down cleanly.  I've been fixing a
*lot* of the things that don't clean up after themselves
today but there's more work before I can say this can be
safely built as a module.  But it's a requirement.
