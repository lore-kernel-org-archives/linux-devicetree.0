I have no idea why you have not received it, but I have sent all
of them to the same  Recipient list!

I even got a relayed confirmation for all 3 of them:
19:35:28.689 2 DEQUEUER [7520159] SMTP(vger.kernel.org)linux-can@vger.kernel.org relayed: relayed via vger.kernel.org
19:35:29.823 2 DEQUEUER [7520154] SMTP(vger.kernel.org)linux-can@vger.kernel.org relayed: relayed via vger.kernel.org
19:35:31.902 2 DEQUEUER [7520160] SMTP(vger.kernel.org)linux-can@vger.kernel.org relayed: relayed via vger.kernel.org

So they should all have arrived!

The biggest problem is that the Register-design of the mcp2517fd is totally 
different compared to mcp251x, so most of those “optimizations” for the 
mcp2517 do not apply to the mcp251x (SPI-API wise IMO the mcp2515 is much
 more efficient - better still when having dedicated gpios for the RX lines
to avoid having to query the status first via spi (reduces latencies
and thus reduces packet loss/overflow on a saturated CAN bus).

I have a spi_async only version of the mcp251x as well (which has been dormant
for a long time, as the mcp251x stopped showing interrupt stopped issues...).

Well - when I increase net->stat.rx_dropped there is always a 
dev_warn_ratelimited that comes along. Also rx_errors is increased at the 
same time. And I see the drops counters increase while there are no messages
in dmesg.

Also note that the driver is only incrementing rx_packets and rx_bytes only 
when netif_rx_ni(skb) is called.

So the setup is this:
* raspberry pi 2 with the mcp2517fd
* beagle bone black
* 1MHz CAN2.0 bus

Beagle bone black:
root@beaglebone:~# cangen can0 -g0.0 -L0 -n 1000000 -p10 -Ii

This saturates the CAN BUS to 100%

on the RPI2 I have no consumer (candump or similar) and the module has
just been reloaded (counters are reset).

I see the following counters:
7: can0: <NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 10
    link/can  promiscuity 0
    can <ONE-SHOT,BERR-REPORTING> state ERROR-ACTIVE (berr-counter tx 0 rx 0) restart-ms 0
	  bitrate 1000000 sample-point 0.750
	  tq 25 prop-seg 14 phase-seg1 15 phase-seg2 10 sjw 1
	  mcp2517fd: tseg1 2..256 tseg2 1..128 sjw 1..128 brp 1..256 brp-inc 1
	  mcp2517fd: dtseg1 1..32 dtseg2 1..16 dsjw 1..16 dbrp 1..256 dbrp-inc 1
	  clock 40000000
	  re-started bus-errors arbit-lost error-warn error-pass bus-off
	  0          0          0          0          0          0         numtxqueues 1 numrxqueues 1 gso_max_size 65536 gso_max_segs 65535
    RX: bytes  packets  errors  dropped overrun mcast
    0          998774   703     4588    0       0
    TX: bytes  packets  errors  dropped carrier collsns
    0          0        0       0       0       0

So you see that packets + dropped > transmitted (1000000).

In a different setup with 4 bytes of data payload:
root@beaglebone:~# cangen can0 -g0.0 -L0 -n 10000 -L4 -p10 -Ii
root@beaglebone:~# cangen can0 -g0.0 -L0 -n 100000 -L4 -p10 -Ii

I get the following statistics:
root@rasp2a:~# ip -details -statistics link show can0
8: can0: <NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP,ECHO> mtu 16 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 10
    link/can  promiscuity 0
    can <ONE-SHOT,BERR-REPORTING> state ERROR-ACTIVE (berr-counter tx 0 rx 0) restart-ms 0
	  bitrate 1000000 sample-point 0.750
	  tq 25 prop-seg 14 phase-seg1 15 phase-seg2 10 sjw 1
	  mcp2517fd: tseg1 2..256 tseg2 1..128 sjw 1..128 brp 1..256 brp-inc 1
	  mcp2517fd: dtseg1 1..32 dtseg2 1..16 dsjw 1..16 dbrp 1..256 dbrp-inc 1
	  clock 40000000
	  re-started bus-errors arbit-lost error-warn error-pass bus-off
	  0          0          0          0          0          0         numtxqueues 1 numrxqueues 1 gso_max_size 65536 gso_max_segs 65535
    RX: bytes  packets  errors  dropped overrun mcast
    440000     110000   0       4343    0       0
    TX: bytes  packets  errors  dropped carrier collsns
    0          0        0       0       0       0
Here 1 get 100% reception rates (bytes and packets are exactly what they 
are supposed to be) but still 0.1% dropped.

When CAN FD is configured on the mcp2517 then things look different
even on a RPI2:
root@beaglebone:~# cangen can0 -g0.0 -L0 -n 1000000 -L0 -p10 -Ii
root@rasp2a:~# ip -details -statistics link show can0
13: can0: <NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP,ECHO> mtu 72 qdisc pfifo_fast state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 10
    link/can  promiscuity 0
    can <ONE-SHOT,BERR-REPORTING,FD> state ERROR-ACTIVE (berr-counter tx 0 rx 0) restart-ms 0
	  bitrate 1000000 sample-point 0.750
	  tq 25 prop-seg 14 phase-seg1 15 phase-seg2 10 sjw 1
	  mcp2517fd: tseg1 2..256 tseg2 1..128 sjw 1..128 brp 1..256 brp-inc 1
	  dbitrate 2000000 dsample-point 0.750
	  dtq 25 dprop-seg 7 dphase-seg1 7 dphase-seg2 5 dsjw 1
	  mcp2517fd: dtseg1 1..32 dtseg2 1..16 dsjw 1..16 dbrp 1..256 dbrp-inc 1
	  clock 40000000
	  re-started bus-errors arbit-lost error-warn error-pass bus-off
	  0          0          0          0          0          0         numtxqueues 1 numrxqueues 1 gso_max_size 65536 gso_max_segs 65535
    RX: bytes  packets  errors  dropped overrun mcast
    0          999840   3       752028  0       0
    TX: bytes  packets  errors  dropped carrier collsns
    0          0        0       0       0       0

In this case the number of packets actually lost on the controller is 0.01%
But the number of dropped packets on the stack is 75%.

The shorter the interval the lower the dropped count.

P.s: For the last test-case here the fifo utilization statistics:

These dmesg lines correspond with the errors (and would also increase “dropped” by 3)
