In NS2, we have host controllers and device controller (not OTG/other
that can switch
between host and device mode). It's only phy that can be in host/device mode.
Since both Host Controllers and Device Controller are connected to the same PHY,
it is based on the extcon logic (the type of cable connected) that PHY
will be in one
of the modes host/device and the respective controller will operate.
