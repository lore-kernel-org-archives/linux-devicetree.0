Yes. I think the problem starts if the interconnect point is not another chip.
It is easy to say "this gpio pin is connected to the interrupt pin of chip X",
but things become murky if you need to express that a gpio pin connects to a
pushbutton or presence detect pin, or if you need to express that an ADC input
pin is used as voltage sensor.

The common theme nowadays seems to be "you can't do that, it is a use case".
It might be more helpful if the feedback was "you can not describe it that way,
let's find another binding that works".

If I add the above to the i2c controller node, the kernel will try to
instantiate the eeprom when the system comes up. If no card is
inserted at that time, this will fail. The above describes the devices
which needs to be instantiated after a card is inserted into the connector,
and only then (and removed when the card is pulled).
In addition, I use the 'ideeprom' property to establish a callback
to be able to read the eeprom contents and trigger loading the DT overlay.

And if insertion is dynamic, triggered by card insertion.

There are actually several additional i2c devices on the same bus.
To instantiate those I use devicetree overlays, but that is done
after the eeprom is read and I know which overlay to load.

Actually, the use case sounds pretty similar, so maybe you have solved the
problem at least to some degree. In my case, I'll also need devicetree overlays,
since I also need to be able to handle OIR capable cards, but that is a separate
set of problems.

Was this just a matter of enabling OF on this platform, or do you have an
out-of-tree set of patches ? If the latter, is it available somewhere
to look at (including the complete devicetree from your above example) ?
