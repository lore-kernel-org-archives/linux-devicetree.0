I agree. The CSI2IPU gasket is a bit special in that it distributes its
input data to four different parallel buses depending on the input's VC,
but upstream of the MIPI CSI-2 receiver, any virtual channel information
is purely a matter of the data sent over the CSI-2 link, and not board
specific hardware description.
