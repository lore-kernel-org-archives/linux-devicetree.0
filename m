I would say: camorama, xawtv3, zbar, google talk, skype. If it runs
with those, it will likely run with any other application.

Taking still pictures using a hardware-accelerated preview is
a sophisticated use case. I don't know any userspace application
that does that. Ok, several allow taking snapshots, by simply
storing the image of the current frame.

Autofocus no. Autogain/Autowhite can be done via libv4l, provided that
it can access the device's controls via /dev/video devnode. Other
applications may be using some other similar algorithms.

Ok, they don't use histograms provided by the SoC. So, they do it in
software, with is slower. Still, it works fine when the light
conditions don't change too fast.

Yes. As I said, libv4l (and some apps) have logic inside to adjust
the image via bright, contrast and white balance controls, using the
video devnode. They don't talk subdev API. So, if those controls
aren't exported, they won't be able to provide a good quality image.

Well, that could be done using other mechanisms, like a modprobe
parameter or by switching the behaviour if a subdev interface is
opened. I don't see much trouble on allowing accessing a control via
both interfaces.

I have one. Unfortunately, I never had a chance to use it, as the display
stopped working one week after I get it.
