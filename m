Is it possible to focus on the current problem instead of calling for
the creation for Yet Another Framework?

OMG, so well, we will have to re-write the whole rtc-at91sam9 now??!! Oh
yes, I see, we do not have more urgent things to do...

Please stop trying re-inventing things that will do everything but
solving the real issues: why not agree on a sort term solution about
this rtt/rtc thing: I have *never* heard complains about this precise
driver. And we must concentrate now on problem solving.
