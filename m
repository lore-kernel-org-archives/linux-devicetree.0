V5 patches are based on Mark Brown's for-next branch of
"git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git"

Changes since V4:
	- Add a new patch for renaming the samsung i2s secondary fifo interface
	  device name from "samsung-i2s.4" to "samsung-i2s-sec"
	- Add platform_device_id table for the primary and secondary DAIs
	- Avoid using of alias ids in the i2s driver by adding of_device_id
	  table. Primary device can get registered via dt or non-dt but secondary
	  device can get registered only at runtime because the secondary is not
	  physically present on the board.

Changes since V3:
        - Added syntex of gpio specifier as suggested by Mark Brown in
          DT document file
        - Added the requirement for having I2S alias ids
        - Explained about gpio lines
        - Made a seperate patch to get the I2S rclk src clk from alias ID

Changes since V2:
        - Rebased on 3.7-rc3
        - Custom DT bindings are prefixed with samsung
        - As generic device tree DMA helpers not yet mainlined
          I am still using custom dma bindings. So added a
          priliminary statement regarding the same. I will rework
          on my patch once generic DMA helpers are mainlined.

Chnages since V1:
        - Rebased on 3.6-rc6
