Because my goal here was to give *every* possible chance for an
objection.  Hence, "dt" and "break" in the subject line, sent to the
devicetree ML.  Also, Marc mentioned the possibility in at least the
cover letter of each of his series.  I don't want anything hidden.

But you are absolutely correct.  (2) was never guaranteed, and it's also
highly improbable as well.  See below.

I was referring to the slide where you mention that distros and vendors
have tied the dtbs to the kernel versions (Slide 23/27, "Usefulness").
I should have been more specific when taking something out of context.
:-P

My point, not well made, was that everyone has decided to slave the
upgrade of the dtb to the upgrade of the kernel.  There is no 'apt-get
armv7-dtbs' that has no dependency structure on a kernel package.  So we
agree, (2) was never guaranteed, and isn't probable either.

thx,

Jason.
