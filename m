These docs were written for non-MC drivers, and for those the documentation
is correct. Unfortunately, this was never updated for MC drivers.

I can't comment either, not having seen his mail and reasoning.

The simple fact is that to my knowledge no other MC applications inherit
controls from subdevs. Suddenly doing something different here seems very
wrong to me and needs very good reasons.

But yes, the current situation sucks. Yelling doesn't help though if nobody
has time and there are several other high-prio projects that need our
attention as well.

If you know a good kernel developer who has a few months to spare, please
point him/her in our direction!
