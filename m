This patch series enable accumulator queue support for K2 SoCs. Accumulator
queues are a type of qmss queue that is monitored by the PDSP firmware and
accumulated. Host is interrupted by PDSP firmware when packets become
available in a ring buffer shared between the host and PDSP.

There was an issue raised when merging the original patch set at
 (1) https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/9/4/681
	[PATCH v1 1/2] soc: ti: display firmware file name as part of boot log
 (2) https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/9/4/680
	[PATCH v1 2/2] ARM: dts: keystone: enable accumulator channels

This series fixes the issues raised against above patch set. Key issues
addressed.

	- Remove the firmware filename from DT and add it to the driver.
	  Use a name ks2_qmss_pdsp_acc48.bin. The idea is this can be a
	  soft link pointing to the real firmware file in file system.

	- Move the description of the driver design from DT document to one
	  under Documentation/arm/keystone/knav-qmss.txt. Update the this
	  document with location of acc firmware available under
	  linux-firmware.git.

Additionally added accumulator queue support optional so that lack of
firmware in the file system will not cause other queue types not available
due to driver probe failure.
