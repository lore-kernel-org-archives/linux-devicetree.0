This patchset adds support for a few different Kirkwood based Synology
NAS boxes. I've taken the board file created by Ben Peddell and
converted it into DT files.

Request for Comment:

Synology hardware design uses a number of sub-designs which get
repeated across boards. Hence i have a lot of .dtsi files, 25 in
total. I decided to place these into a subdirectory
arch/arm/boot/dts/synology. Is this a good idea, or is it preferred to
keep them alongside the .dts files?

Request for Testing:

This patch adds support for around 30 different boards. Most .dts
files support a couple of different models. I don't have any of this
hardware. None of this is tested.
