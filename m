I guess then you haven't correctly understood my argument, as that's
exactly what's happened.  We have a DT implementation which accurately
describes the clock architecture on each of our platforms. The
associated C code in drivers/clk/ is written to extract the
information from it, the hardware description and register the clocks
properly.

What makes you think differently?

Not sure I understand why this is different from any other binding?

Easy to say (and implement), but that means duplicating the hardware
description in DT, which is not a design win.

Did you actually read and understand the points here?  If not, just
say so and I'll figure out a way to explain the issues better.  3) is
not an alternative to 1) and 2).  Instead 1) and 2) imply 3).

I *want* to have a generic solution, and have made several passes at
writing one.  The question here is; what does that look like?  Some
people don't like the idea of having it in DT due to possible abuse of
the property.  But we can't have anything only in C because our clock
implementation (rightly) doesn't know or (shouldn't have to) care
about platform specifics.  Instead all platform description is in DT,
where it should be.  So to specify critical-clocks we need either 1)
or 2) above to pull the info out and send to 3).
