Yep, this is exactly the issue I was facing when I tried to map the 128 
interrupts lines of an OMAP4 to the GIC. Adding 128 entries to an 
interrupt map just to handle a simple linear translation with a constant 
value of 32 is clearly overkill.

Maybe we can just extend or add a new type of interrupt nexus to handle 
simple translation. The actual one was done for complex PCI mapping but 
with a small number of lines to handle. In our case, the mapping is 
simple, but the number of lines is huge.
