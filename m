Yes, it does work. I tested this by using an Intel E1000E PCIe NIC card 
installed in our system and have it fall back to INTx.

Perhaps it works because we are claiming "pcie0" as an interrupt 
controller by itself and the INTx is modeled under that.

Please let me know if the above model makes sense or not.

Thanks,
