I'm following this work from a distance but as we've just celebrated the
1st anniversary for this patch series (11 June 2016), I propose that we
now make up our mind quickly. Everybody seem to be on the same page and
willing to make this rework move forward.

In Microchip/Atmel we would like to actually use this TCB rework both
internally and in our mainline work to avoid having to rely on our own
out-of-tree implementation.

The newly-added samv7 cortex-M can't boot without this series and a use
of our current cortex-A SoCs with TrustZone in Secure World (SWd) is not
possible with current mainline code only. On these two examples, the
current timer on which we rely, the PIT, is not present.

So you probably understand that more than one year without real progress
begins to be a little bit frustrating for the AT91 users...
