Hmm... its not uncommon that it is done in the kernel, but
that is rarely an indicator of if something is actually
technically valid or not. Casting from an integer to a pointer
is technically implementation defined, but we clearly rely on
gcc's implementation in the kernel. However, without actually
reading the spec in more detail I am unclear on if an enum counts
as an integer here, my suspicion is that it would since it
generally always implicitly casts to an int.

I guess the correct fix is that .data should probably be a
kernel_ulong_t in of_device_id. But if no one else objects I am
happy for you to leave your current code as is.

Thanks,
Charles
