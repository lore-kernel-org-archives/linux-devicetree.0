That's one way to address the issue, sure. I just wonder if we should
keep the declaration of the mdio bus with "snps,dwmac-mdio" in the dts
using it, with the phy explicitly declared ...

Otherwise, we have to make clear that you must always explicitly
declare your PHY in amlogic's dts so there is no surprise.

As you mentioned, we missed the gxbb-nexbox-a95. No phy declared in
that dts, but it still get the mdio bus from meson-gx.dtsi. So as of
"ARM64: dts: meson-gx: move the MDIO node to meson-gx" the PHY is not
detected on this board.

Nothing related to the tx-delay ... I'm all for it ;) Thx for your work
by the way

What I meant is that as of "ARM64: dts: meson-gx: move the MDIO node to
meson-gx" all boards not declaring the PHY explicitly can't detect it
anymore. that's more or less all gxbb boards

With "ARM64: dts: meson-gxbb-odroidc2: add reset for the ethernet PHY"
the odroid gets fixed ... but the p200 and vega-s95 are still broken 

With the next patch, the p200 is/should have been fixed, then the vega-
s95 is fixed 

In the end the gxbb-nexbox is still broken. To be honest I did not
verify if there any other board in that case.

My point is that I think the declaration of the mdio bus in meson-
gx.dtsi and the declaration of each PHY in the board dtss should be
done in single commit to avoid having a (very) short part of the
history with regressions
