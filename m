The code is largely based upon the existing cti helpers, which just had
a cti_map_trigger() function. The use-case you described is not
supported by the current helpers and so also not supported in my initial
implementation (although we should add this). Hence, it would be
probably best to split the cti_map_trigger() into two functions say,
cti_map_triggerin() and cti_map_triggerout(), to map a trigger
input/output to a channel.

I need to think about this some more, as this does make it a little more
complex. Right now only one entity can use a cti module at a time.

Yes that's possible.

Yes it would be good to make this all part of the same coresight framework.
