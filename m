Hi,

Apologies for the slow responses here, I meant to follow up on this sooner.

tead of ioctl API?

I'm personally less worried about whether the calls are through an
ioctl API or an EEMI one, but if it is through ioctl, I'd prefer if it
wasn't wide-open pass-through. I.e. that the ioctls you actually use
are documented, and only those who are whitelisted are passed through
(and not in general exported to userspace).

Does that make sense?
