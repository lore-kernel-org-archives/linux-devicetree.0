I see the idea. So here is a proposal of DT for the Cubox (audio + vide=
o)
which should work without too many difficulties.

/* video / audio transmitter */

	tda998x: hdmi-encoder {
		compatible =3D "nxp,tda998x";
		...

		/* video */
		port@0 {
			tda998x_0: endpoint {
				reg =3D <0x230145>;
				remote-endpoint =3D <&lcd0_0>;
			};
		};

		/* audio */
		port@1 {
			hdmi_i2s_audio: endpoint@0 {
				reg =3D <0x03>;
				remote-endpoint =3D <&audio_hdmi_i2s>;
			};
			hdmi_spdif_audio: endpoint@1 {
				reg =3D <0x04>;
				remote-endpoint =3D <&audio_hdmi_spdif>;
			};
		};
	};

	toslink: spdif {
		compatible =3D "linux,spdif-dit";
		port {
			spdif_audio: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint =3D <&audio_spdif>;
			};
		};
	};

/* video */

	lcd0: video-controller {
		compatible =3D "marvell,dove-lcd";
		...
		port {
			lcd0_0: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint =3D <&tda998x_0>;
			};
		};
	};

	video {
		compatible =3D "media-video";
		video-controller =3D <&lcd0>;
	};

/* audio */

	audio1: audio-controller {
		compatible =3D "marvell,dove-audio";
		...
		port@0 {
			audio_hdmi_i2s: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint =3D <&hdmi_i2s_audio>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			audio_hdmi_spdif: endpoint@0 {
				remote-endpoint =3D <&hdmi_spdif_audio>;
			};
			audio_spdif: endpoint@1 {
				remote-endpoint =3D <&spdif_audio>;
			};
		};
	};

	sound {
		compatible =3D "media-audio";
		audio-controller =3D <&audio1>;
	};
