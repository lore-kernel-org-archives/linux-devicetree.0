Russell's point about not creating policy for userspace is on the mark.
*I* think the most-specific compatible string should be unique per
board, and thus would be a sane naming scheme.  But that is exactly as
Russell said making policy for userspace.  If you said as much, I missed
it.  Sorry about that.

Now, off on a tangent...

Ok, so the ${soc}-${board} is a work-around until all bootloaders are
providing a dtb, or until all bootloaders are providing a stable dtb?

I ask because in tinkering with pxa-impedance-matcher [1], I've setup
selecting from many dtbs at boot (linked in, no fs support) by
specifying the desired board compatible string on the kernel
commandline (patches still a wip).  The impedance-matcher then scans
through the provided dtbs looking for a match.

It's a hack, and only useful until bootloaders are providing dtbs.  If
the dtb is upgradable, then it goes away earlier.  If the dtb isn't,
then it'll be around longer.  It's goal is to keep silly code out of the
kernel (non-standard atag-to-fdt translation, other bootloader
workarounds).  Perhaps it'll be used to translate ACPI into DT for a
bit... :)

Thanks for the detailed explanation.  I'll post a non-RFC version in the
next few days.

thx,

Jason.
