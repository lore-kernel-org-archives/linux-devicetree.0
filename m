I actually would rather like to know if the people on the DT side have any
problems with the child functions.

Because, suppose that they wouldn't like those functions at all.  What are we
supposed to do, then, honestly?  Add the whole DT vs ACPI logic to the leds-gpio
and gpio_keys_polled drivers?  But these drivers have no reason whatsoever
to include that.  Zero.

So suggestions welcome.

[BTW, In principle we also could use something like

typedef union dev_node {
	struct acpi_device *acpi_node;
	struct device_node *of_node;
} dev_node_t;

instead of the (void *) for more type safety.  It still is useful to pass the
parent pointer along with that, though.]

That certainly is doable, although the resulting macro would generate a rather
large chunk of code each time it is used.
