Yeah, I wouldn't use it anyway, see my comment below.

Maybe it is similar in other drivers but at91 platforms can still be
booted without DT, This will fail with:
atmel_spi: probe of atmel_spi.0 failed with error -22

The efm32 only supports DT, it doesn't have board files/platform data.

This will be taken care of by the spi core, in of_spi_register_master()=
:

	nb =3D of_gpio_named_count(np, "cs-gpios");
	master->num_chipselect =3D max_t(int, nb, master->num_chipselect);

It is filled when registering the master, here when calling
devm_spi_register_master(). It may be too late at that point.

Maybe you could use the CS number ifor the label here instead of
DRIVER_NAME, at least, use pdev->dev->name and completely drop
DRIVER_NAME.

Mark: maybe it would make sense to do devm_gpio_request_one() in
of_spi_register_master(), after of_get_named_gpio.

While this solves the particular issue Ji=C5=99=C3=AD is seeing, this w=
ill not
solve the case where PA14 (CS0) is not used by the spi driver at all. I=
t
will remained muxed as CS0 and toggle when the spi master needs to
access CS0 until another driver muxes it to something else. I still
believe we should explicitly ask pinctrl to mux them as gpios.
