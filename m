Well one example - here specifically is to set up bclk rates that
the I2S hw itself is transferring for specific combinations.

Some of these rules depend on:
* the i2s driver hw itself - the i2s bcm2835 can only handle 32 bit
  transfers - so the block size needs to be set as a multiple of 2.
  in this case: sample-bits * channels.
* HW limits - e.g 24 bit/sample need to get transferred as 32 bit
  for the rpi-pcm5102a combination
* Clock selection dependent - the choice of the block size
  may be also 40 or 80 bit so that a integer divider clock
  can get selected as a preference.
  E.g 32 bit/sample * 2 channels * 48kHz gives a divider of 25/4
  using the main oscillator at 19.2MHz, which introduces some
  (possibly) audible  noise due to jitter.
  while 40bit/sample * 2 channels * 48kHz gives an integer divider
  of 20.

So controlling those helps using the hw setup properly.

I heard about some other devices besides the HifiBerry DAC that
also would like to control the blockrate the same way.

I remember having seen some other possible things we want to
control on the driver side during hw-params invocation, but
I can not remember what these were on top of my head (GPIO,
external clock selection if I remember correctly)

Because then the driver would have to know a lot more
about the combination of board and codec.

Also the idea proposed by Mark was to use simple-card
instead of a dedicated driver which does not allow for
these kind of controls.

The idea was also to make it generic enough that it could
get even become part of the framework.

Just food for thought, because otherwise there would be dependencies
on compiled codecs (or a long #ifdef list)

As an alternative we could also add a method tables to the codec
structure, so that codecs could expose additional methods, that could
then get used.
