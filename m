It doesn't seem to be what I suggest. I see two issues in
flexrm_process_completions()
1) It calls mbox_send_message(), which is a big NO for a controller
driver. Why should you have one more message stored outside of
ringbuffer?

2) It calls mbox_chan_received_data()  which is for messages received
from the remote. And not the way to report failed _transmission_, for
which the api calls back mbox_client.tx_done() .  In your client
driver please populate mbox_client.tx_done() and see which message is
reported "sent fine" when.

I agree that we may have to get the queue length from platform, if
MBOX_TX_QUEUE_LEN is limiting performance. That will be easier on both
of us. However I suspect the right fix for _this_ situation is in
flexrm driver. See above.

How does the client use the api? Does it work in blocking mode i.e, is
tx_block set ? Is it available somewhere I can have a look?

Thanks.
