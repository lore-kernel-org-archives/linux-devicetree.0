The only thing you are guaranteed is the OF code created some platform
devices. That's it. Whether any driver probed successfully is separate
and a lot more things can go wrong there. The only thing you are
checking is that your dtb is not crap.

Certainly not the latter. We don't want drivers mucking with flags
internal to the DT code.
