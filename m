It's complicated :(

Right, but we have patches for some iommu drivers based on this API,
and we should migrate all of them eventually.

Yes, but we also need to pass a PCI device specific identifier along
with the root bus node, because some iommu drivers take the PCI
bus/device/function number into account for creating per-function
i/o page tables.

This probably won't ever apply to PCI devices, so let's ignore it for now.
For the moment (and for PCI), we should assume that we either configure
an iommu directly or we use dma-ranges if no iommu is in use.
