I like the interface, good idea!

A few questions:

Is there a plan for migrating all the existing users of the current GPIO
interface?

How do you want to deal with drivers that work on platforms that currently
don't use gpiolib but have their own implementation of asm/gpio.h? Are
we going to phase them out?

If we are adding a new way to deal with GPIOs, would it make sense to
have that more closely integrated into pinctrl in one form or another?
My feeling is that there is already a significant overlap between the
two, and while the addition of the gpiod_* functions doesn't necessarily
make this worse, it could be a chance to improve the current situation
to make the interface more consistent with pinctrl.
