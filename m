Through platform_data?

Or maybe that could be done using a function that would attach a cell
to a struct device?

I'm not sure that would cover all cases though.

Except that this is highly dependent on the usage you're making of
this API.

It could be fine to expect that if your writing machine code, that for
one given SoC will always be true.

If you're writing driver code, that will just have to lookup one value
=66rom an EEPROM, the exact offset, size and device being completely
board dependant, it's not really practical.

Is that really necessary? I mean, the point of having an abstraction
layer is precisely to *not* care about the provider when you are the
consumer.

If we can't, then the abstraction layer is not good enough and we
should improve it, but we shouldn't need to hack around it.
