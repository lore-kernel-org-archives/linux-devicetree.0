The tzx-723q[a]4 board variant of A33 based Q8 formfactor tablets was
given its own dts file because the mmc would not work with a drive
strength of 30mA, Android seemed to be using a lower drive-strength
and doing the same with the upstream kernel seemed to fix this issue.

While working on a similar fix for u-boot I noticed that Android did
not use a lower drive strength for mmc0, but for mmc1, so mmc0 should
work fine with a drive strength of 30mA.

Further investigation has shown that Allwinner is using slightly
tweaked clock sample phase settings in newer Android kernels, and
that updating the mainstream sunxi mmc driver to these settings fixes
this.

With this fixed we no longer need a dts file specifically for these
pcb varants -> drop this dts file.

This reverts commit fb61c559a810f1487892b83d2d0606af1d020318.
