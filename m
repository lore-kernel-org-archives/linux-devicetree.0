Hi Rob,

I'll fix this.

Yes, if you agree, I'd go for adc1@0, adc2@100, adc3@200, to reflect reg 
property for child node.
Is it ok from your point of view ?

stm32f4 can have up to 19 channels, numbered from 0 to 18 to match with 
reference manual.
I'll add this.

It's related to ADC sequencer, and the way it's being configured/used 
(see above paragraph on regular/injected).
This is not related to what's connected to adc inputs.
As suggested by Jonathan, I think I'll drop injected support for now, to 
simplify the driver and review.

Thanks,
