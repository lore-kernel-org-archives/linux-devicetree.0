It's worth a try. The bluetooth bits only require one GPIO line and
the external clock. (This is mostly to ensure it powers on properly.)
Though the ordering is important, too. I'll look into it.

Sure. Might be for 4.4 though.

I'm off to bed for today. Only turned on my computer to answer
some last minute questions from Maxime. :)
