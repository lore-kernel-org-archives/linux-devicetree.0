I'd certainly not like to see #foo-cells in _DSD given it should be
possible with a package to have a package description like the
following:

	Package () {
		Package () { ^ref1, data, data }, 
		Package () { ^ref2, dta, data, data },
	}

Where the #foo-cells is implicit in each instance. That makes variadic
properties possible, and makes it possible to perform validation on each
tuple even in the binary format, which we can't do with a DTB

I'm not so sure on foo-names unless we made names an explicit
requirement from the start (which I wish was the case on the DT side).
Even then we might need other parallel properties anyway (think
clock-indicies).

Mark.
