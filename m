When you say "doesn't support common clock", you mean the code for that
platform is incompatible with the common clock framework? It seems very
messy to allow a Linux-internal implementation detail (which is expected
to change) to leak into a binding...

What I meant was that I am surprised there isn't a helper doing all of:
* of_parse_phandle
* snd_soc_of_get_dai_name
* snd_soc_of_parse_daifmt

It looks like a common pattern that could be factored out.

Huh? That's not what I asked.

What if the dt has neither a clock or a system-clock-frequency property?

The issue here is that I'm almost totally unfamiliar with audio
hardware, nor the ASoC bindings. If this makes sense to you and Mark
Brown then I'm happy to continue not understanding either. :)

Thanks,
Mark.
