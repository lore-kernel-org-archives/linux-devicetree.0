We have a lot of boards with an 8-cell dot matrix LED. Each cell is 
programmed with an 8-bit value.  The mapping of these values to the dots 
defaults to ASCII character rendering, but there is the facility to 
install other bitmaps as well.

Really I view these things not as part of the LED subsystem, but more as 
a very small frame buffer.

We like to display entire words, and the most useful interface from a 
user point of view is something that consumes entire strings rather than 
having to manage each cell independently.

You could imagine that if the text to be displayed were longer than the 
display, that the driver would make it continuously scroll.  I would 
like to see a framework where a simple character device were exposed, 
and from userspace you could do: "echo message > /dev/small-display" and 
get something sensible.
