Sorry for the delay in replying on my side too.

As I mentioned, I do not like the idea of adding compatible properties
just to force the kernel to create platform devices out of device tree
nodes. On top of that I would avoid adding a compatible property
to the cpus node (after all properties like enable-method are common for all
cpus but still duplicated), my only concern being backward compatibility
here (ie if we do that for interrupts, we should do that also for other
common cpu nodes properties, otherwise we have different rules for
different properties).

I think you can then add interrupts to cpu nodes ("qcom,krait" specific),
and as you mentioned create a platform device for that.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
