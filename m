Hello Srini (I hope you had a nice vacation!)


Running checkpatch on this patch gives a few of these warnings:

WARNING: line over 80 characters

These can probably be ignored, since they exist for most
arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom-*.dts files.


However, it also gives a few of these errors:

ERROR: trailing whitespace

These should probably be fixed, since the are errors and not warnings.


Kind regards,
Niklas
