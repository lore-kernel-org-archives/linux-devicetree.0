Yes, I'm aware of that.

Actually the driver has to determine the number of codecs, as one of them 
requires additional configuration steps. But this is currently being taken
care of by looking at number of entries in one of the properties.

Right, there is really no need now for another compatible as the 
differences across boards are handled through additional properties.

As Mark said, it is not essential what we decide here, my preference was 
to keep these 2 compatibles. I might got confused a bit and did not consider
a more feature complete "hardkernel,odroid-xu3-audio" binding being applied 
to a XU4 device supporting only a subset of functionality.
