It depends on whether you have any machines that rely on this for backwards
compatibility. If the platform support is still work in progress and you
wouldn't be able to run a machine with an upstream kernel yet, just say
in the patch description that this breaks compatibility and why it is ok
in this particular case.

If you have existing users that rely on these properties, make the
driver code handle the existing dtb files but print a warning if you
encounter them. In the documentation, you should list the new method
as required then, but you can mention that the old method might be
accepted for backwards compatibility.
