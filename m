This code was a remainder of simple-card.

Setting the audio format in the CPU side of the link is of no interest
when this format is the same for all CODECs. In this case, the audio
controller may set itself this format when it creates its DAIs, and,
then, the audio format is an audio controller property.

On the other hand, when the format depends on the remote endpoints, it
should appear in the graph in the CODEC ports.

We discussed about the graph of ports last year
http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2014-January/07063=
4.html
but some pieces of software were lacking, as the multi-codec links.

The DT should describe the hardware, and the simple-card mixes hardware
and software.
=46or example, the kirkwood controller may create 2 CPU DAIs. With the
simple-card, the DT contains a number to reference these DAIs (for
example, implicitly, <audio1 0> references the I2S output). So, what if
the controller creates only one DAI, or, what if the FreeBSD/OpenBSD/..
driver does not set the same references to these DAIs?
The graph of port fixes this problem.

More: a simple audio card may easily be created from a graph of ports
as the simple-card does, but by the audio-controller (sorry, I also
forgot the kirkwood patch for this in my previous patch request).
In case of complex cards, the links and properties of this graph may
also be used by board specific card devices.

The ports and endpoints may contain properties to describe these
configurations. Complex cases should be handled by specific card
builders.

This is already the case for the bus types of the kirkwood controller,
I2S or S/PDIF. Such properties may appear in either local or remote
port, or in both.

OK. I looked if the widgets and routes could also be described in a
graph, but, it complexifies the syntax. So, this information could have
the same syntax as in the simple-card.

On the other hand, where would this information appear in the graph?
As I understood, on card creation, the widgets and routes, which appear
at the card level, redefine the CPU and CODEC DAI definitions.

With a DT graph, each CPU/CODEC would know exactly the widgets and
routes it has to define.

Right, and that's why I'd be glad to have quickly something in the
kernel. More properties could be added later as there would be requests=
