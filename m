That's a really good point.  However I think that the path I'll
take to *getting* to scheduling the poll in interrupt context
will use a threaded interrupt handler.  I'm hoping that will
allow me to simplify the code in steps.

The main reason for this split between working in interrupt
context when possible, but pushing to a workqueue when not, is
to allow IPA clock(s) to be turned off.  Enabling the clocks
is a blocking operation, so can't' be done in the top half
interrupt handler.  The thought was it would be best to work
in interrupt context--if the clock was already active--but
to defer to a workqueue to turn the clock on if necessary.

The result requires locking and duplication of code that I
find to be pretty confusing--and hard to reason about.  I
have been planning to re-do things to be better suited to
NAPI, and knowing that, I haven't given the data path as
much attention as some of the rest.

Yes, I agree with that.  There are multiple levels of abstraction
in play and they aren't helpful.  We have ipa_desc structures that
are translated by ipa_send() into gsi_xfer_elem structures, which
are ultimately recorded by gsi_channel_queue() as 16 byte gsi_tre
structures.  At least one of those translations can go away.

Thanks.
