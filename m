Yes, it is implicitly GPL-2.0 since it is in the kernel tree and has
no other license text.

Adding 'or-later' is a licensing change. If IBM is the copyright
holder on all this file, then that is fine.

It would probably be up to your company. If that's an issue, then not
dual licensing is fine. I don't want to hold things up on that.

Yes, just a preference.

That generally doesn't matter. You can assume common properties will
have a schema and you don't need to define common constraints (like
'function' is a string array). You only need what is specific to this
binding which is possible values.
