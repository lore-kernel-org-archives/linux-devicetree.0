If there are too-few cells, the binding and driver can always be
expanded to support more cells in a backwards-compatible way.

Oh, I always thought that the Samsung bindings were one of the major
issues here, but you're right - they do have the inversion flag already.

So, perhaps there really isn't an issue, and we should revisit the
GPIO-based regulator bindings and drivers, and allow them to
(additionally) rely on the GPIO flags in the standard way.
