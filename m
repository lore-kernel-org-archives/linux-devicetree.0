I'm saying that you should be using a MFD here like all the other
CODECs with multiple functions and that you shouldn't have
compatible strings in DT for the subfunctions since you already
know they'll be there simply from enumerating the chip as a whole
and how exactly they are divided up is a function of how Linux
currently has subsystems, not of the hardware.

No, you've got them as DT nodes.
