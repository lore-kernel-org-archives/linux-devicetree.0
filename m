Typically VFIO-platform also comes with a corresponding reset driver.
You don't need one?

No IOMMU was described in the DT binding. It sounds like you'd need an
optional (not present in the guest) iommus property per-channel

Do you have a link to that? Seeing it would help to ease my concerns.

Thanks,
