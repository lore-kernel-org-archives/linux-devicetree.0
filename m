Hi everyone,


This patchset add the audio codec for Allwinner A33 (sun8i) SoC.

It adds different drivers:
   - sun8i-codec-analog (patch 4): This driver implements the analog part
   of the audio codec. The analog part is handled in PRCM registers so this
   driver must be added as prcm's subnode (patch 5).
   - sun8i-codec (patch 6): This driver implements the digital part of the
   A33 codec.
   - sun8i (patch 7): This driver implements a sound card for A33.
   It links the DAI and the audio codec. The analog codec driver is handled
   as an "aux_device".

The DAI for this codec is the same than for A20: "sun4i-i2s".
The digital codec code is coming from Allwinner's BSP (after some
cleanup and DAPM conversion) [1]
The analog codec driver is coming from Chen-Yu Tsai's driver [2]
with some modifications (such as read/write regmap functions).

Currently, all the drivers handle only the playback feature.
The other ones (such as capture) and all other interfaces except
headphone are not supported.

These drivers are functional except for one issue. When playing a sound
for the first time, a short delay can be noticed. On a second play
(right after), the sound is played correctly. If we wait a short time
(~5 sec), the delay is back.
There is the same behavior for left/right channel. On the first
time, a left sound is played on the left channel but in the second
time, the sound will be played on wrong channel.

These issues will be fixed in a second time. Is someone have suggestions
about it?

Examples of amixer commands:
	amixer set 'Headphone' 75%
	amixer set 'Headphone' on
	amixer set 'DAC' on
	amixer set 'Right DAC Mixer RSlot 0' on
	amixer set 'Left DAC Mixer LSlot 0' on
	amixer set 'DAC Reversed Right' on
	amixer set 'DAC Reversed Left' on

It was tested on Parrot and Sinlinx board where device tree's modifications
are added (patch 11 to 14).

Thank you in advance,
