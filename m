True. We could temporarily remove or rename if the same file exists in
the directory below to help people catch that problem. I really would
like to clean up that build rule to be consistent though.

The other option is to move all the .dts files into the boot
directory, but I don't think that is a good idea at all.

Yes it is supposed to be the same thing. Doesn't it effectively do the
same since dtbs depends on $(dtb-y)?
