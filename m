Jean,

Various discussions around power-aware scheduling have amplified the
need for the scheduler to have some knowledge of DVFS. This would then
require the scheduler to track 'cpu_power' ( =3D max power) and perhaps
a new variable 'current_power' that is changed by the DVFS framework.

The first goal, though, is to make sure that the scheduler can handle
different cpu_power values due to asymmetric cores.
