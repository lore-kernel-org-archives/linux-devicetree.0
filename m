There are a reasonable number, but the patch set does cross ALSA, DT and ACPI,
and those addresses are retrieved from the getmaintainer.pl script as
maintainers/supporters of those subsystems. I've also seen e-mails with larger
To and Cc fields appear on the various mailing lists without issue, so am
struggling to figure out why my initial patches aren't making it.

I can of course try again with a further reduced number of To/Cc, but I don't
want to miss off important reviewers, and I really don't want to spam the lists
unnecessarily.
