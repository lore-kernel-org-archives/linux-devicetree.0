Hum. I guess we could call it atmel-ssc-sound.c, since the ultimate
goal would be to make it codec agnostic, but there's quite some work
to achieve that (handle the widgets, mclk and rates by DT).
But I really don't know if it's better to keep this name as long as
g20 is not supported, and change it after or have a name that is not
reflecting what the machine driver is doing right now.
Maybe Bo or Nicolas can give their feeling on that (since I'm not
Atmel, I don't know every SoC or what their Big Plan is for sound
machine drivers)

Richard.
