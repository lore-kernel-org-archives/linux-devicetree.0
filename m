This is the only remaining part of the "ARM: Conexant Digicolor CX92755 SoC 
support" series. See v3 changelog at 
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1865896.

v4:
   * Rename conexant_equinox.dts to cx92755_equinox.dts which is closer to 
     common practice (Olof Johansson)

   * Add a syscon node; this is now required for the interrupt controller

   * Decrease the registers range in the interrupt controller node to just the 
     IC registers range. We now use syscon to access the global UC_IRQ_CONTROL 
     register.

   * Rename the interrupt controller node to "interrupt-controller" as per 
     ePAPR
