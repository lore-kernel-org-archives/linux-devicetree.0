Actually you did confirm that point by starting an argument about not
needing a central repository and you not liking Linux as the location.
That was exactly what I meant with my original comment.

Adding Actions Semi was somewhat easy as a new vendor and now - roughly
a year after the board went to market - there's Linaro contributions
from Mani that I'm thankful for.

Whereas patches keep falling into a dark hole when there's already other
work for a certain vendor, such as Marvell and now Socionext, with no
one feeling responsible for either taking them or saying, "hey, we're
not going to submit any conflicting DT bindings for SynQuacer because we
use ACPI, so please go ahead with proposal X, thanks for your efforts".

Don't complain about me ranting if you belittle my volunteer work that I
believe Linaro and its partners should've done in the first place: If I
can get an initial mainline PoC done as an individual on a few
evenings/weekends, then the same should be super-easy for an
organization with lots of engineers and paying member companies.
As I've pointed out, an ever-increasing frustration builds over Linaro
continuing to announce new boards (such as SynQuacer) that will be the
best since sliced bread, while neglecting the 96boards that are already
on the market and equally are promoted under the "96Boards" brand.
The Linaro CEO has been promoting the Orange Pi i96 in keynotes, so
management is aware of that hardware, and yet not a single patch came
from Xunlong, RDA Micro or Linaro. No patch review from RDA either. And
my patches got stuck on the bindings not including interrupts property
for the UART yet, since I still do not have their custom interrupt
controller working... So the context here is that not just my 4.14+
pulls got stuck but three other 96Boards patch series, too.

Andreas
