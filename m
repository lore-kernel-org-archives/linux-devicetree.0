I believe it's easier to review the way it is. Each patch is simple and it's
easy to see where a particular piece of code is moved. I'm happy to fold
them, too, but I'd prefer keep "[PATCH v2 07/17] device property: Read
strings using string array reading functions" separate, as it changes the
implementation of reading single strings.

How about that?
