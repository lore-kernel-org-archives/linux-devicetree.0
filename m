Hi,

Here are a few simple patches for the jz4740.

First adds dynamic sampling support to jz4740-i2s.
Then two to add a simple binding and DT support.
Then a patch to set the clock rate for i2s.

These are in preparation for jz4780 and ci20 later on.

Patches are based on 3.19-rc7. Quite disjoint and stay within jz4740 
so should apply easily on other trees.

If you would like to have them rebased to a different tree, please tell.

Thank-you

V4 changes: 
Added Acked-by: Lars-Peter Clausen <lars@metafoo.de> 
Rebased on 3.19-rc7
Removed patch 4 which was redundant

V3 changes:
Added dma binding to example but forgot to put it in required properties.

V2 changes: 
Removed a redundant #define
Added #ifdef CONFIG_OF
Added dma in binding document
Removed a redundant call to clk_prepare_enable
