Yes, I get that, but that is only meaningful if you want to run an OS
that is only aware of 395 on a 398 SoC/board (though I'd guess the 390
compat is enough for that). Otherwise, that property is not really
meaningful as the additional nodes are enough to handle what is the
superset.

I would agree both are fine if both chips are in fact the same die,
just fused or packaged differently. I've seen a lot of chips that are
supposed to be sub/supersets of each other, but have different errata
lists because they are different die.
