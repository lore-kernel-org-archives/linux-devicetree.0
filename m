> Pin muxing is not defined in board file. Please move it into SOC dtsi file.

Pin muxing used is different for different boards. e.g. usart1_rx pad is PA10 for stm32f769-disco board while it is PB7 for stm32f746-disco board. 
The other possibilities for same pad (usart1_rx) is PB15. To make situation bit more complex, it is only available in f769 device.

Putting in SOC dtsi file means having lot of combinations for different pins in separate groups. 
e.g. only for one instance of one ip (usart1), following groups might be required at one point of time:

usart1_pa10_pa9 {..}
usart1_pa10_pb14 {..}
usart1_pa10_pb6 {..}

usart1_pb7_pa9 {..}
usart1_pb7_pb14 {..}
usart1_pb7_pb6 {..}

usart1_pb15_pa9 {..}
usart1_pb15_pb14 {..}
usart1_pb15_pb6 {..}

In case of boards based on stm32f746 device, all the above mentioned groups with pb14 & pb15 will not be available.
One solution (to avoid using not available groups) could be to have separate dtsi (or separate pinmux.dtsi) for different devices of same family like one for stm32f746 & other for stm32f769. Still it does not resolve the need to have lot of groups combinations for each instance of every peripheral in dtsi as mentioned above.

It seems cleaner solution would be pin muxing in board dts file. Please let me know if there is some drawback of this approach. One point which i can think of is : duplication of pinmux groups in different board dts files.

Cheers,
Vikas
