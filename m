Overall looks sane, but I wonder if we should try harder to not duplicate
some of the mistakes we made in the DT bindings. Two points in particular
stick out:

The way we name things in DT using separate "foos" and "foo-names" properties
is a bit quirky. Those are always defined on a per-subsystem level, not
a per-device level though, so it should be possible to come up with a
better representation in ACPI.

Since the device driver should never look into the "foo-names" property
itself but just pass down the name into the subsystem, the "foo" subsystem
could instead have a way to add an (optional) name for each reference.

This is something the DT syntax doesn't allow because you can't have
both a phandle and a string in a single property but I think the ACPI
packages can do it, and it wouldn't change the basic structure.

Similarly, the "#foo-cells" syntax is an artifact of the limitations of the
DT syntax, and I'd assume there would be a better way to encode this
in ACPI. Also, a "cell" in Open Firmware is defined as a big-endian
32-bit value, which doesn't directly correspond to something in ACPI,
and the '#' character is an artifact of the use of the Forth language
in Open Firmware, which you also don't have here.
