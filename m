Hah ok. We should delete some of those arch specific clkdev.h
files...

Oh hrm.. I must have missed v2.

Ok. A comment here would be helpful in the future. We probably
ought to have a comment in clk-fixed-factor as well.

No I think we should delete CLK_IS_BASIC. So please remove it
unless you actually need it.
