That doesn't fix the problem.  If the DRM driver is built in, but the
codec is not, and the DRM driver has a reference to
tda9998x_codec_register(), then the vmlinux file will fail to link,
and you'll never get the opportunity to call request_module().

I'm not sure that's right either.

Let's go back and think about this: why should SND_SOC_TDA998X be
*selected*.  Let me put that a different way: why should this symbol
be forced on just because we're building the DRM TDA998x driver?

Would it be more sensible to make SND_SOC_TDA998X depend on
DRM_I2C_NXP_TDA998X instead, maybe with a 'default y' - which is a
kinder way to have SND_SOC_TDA998X be enabled.  If SND_SOC_TDA998X
doesn't have a prompt, then it'll automatically enable itself too
this way when all its dependencies are satisfied.

IMHO "select" is a very over-used, and in many cases an evil
construct because its very hard to avoid breaking dependencies
with it.
