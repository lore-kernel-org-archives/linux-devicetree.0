That may be - but the problem with CDF solving this problem is that it's
wrong.  It's fixing what is in actual fact a *generic* problem in a much
too specific way.  To put it another way, it's forcing everyone to fix
the same problem in their own separate ways because no one is willing to
take a step back and look at the larger picture.

We can see that because ASoC has exactly the same problem - it has to
wait until all devices (DMA, CPU DAIs, codecs etc) are present before it
can initialise, just like DRM.  Can you re-use the CDF solution for ASoC?
No.  Can it be re-used elsewhere in non-display subsystems?  No.

Therefore, CDF is yet another implementation specific solution to a
generic problem which can't be re-used.

Yes, I realise that CDF may do other stuff, but because of the above, it's
a broken solution.
