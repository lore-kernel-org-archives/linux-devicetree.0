You are right, devm_*API is currently not a good idea! I didn't
realize that the ->attach_dev() callback was invoked from
__pm_genpd_add_device(). Sorry for the noise.

Anyway,  I am working on adding the option to return -EPROBE_DEFER
from the ->attach_dev() callback, since that could be useful to
support.

Kind regards
