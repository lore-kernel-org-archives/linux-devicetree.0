when handling all of this (clock names, parents, ...) in C. The same is true
BTW for PM Domains.

The clock controllers of r8a7791 and r8a7795 are very similar, and could
be handled similarly.
Compare the DT hierarchy for CPG and MSTP/MSSR in
arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7791.dtsi and arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/r8a7795.dtsi.

Binding definitions are
    include/dt-bindings/clock/r8a7791-clock.h
vs
    include/dt-bindings/clock/r8a7795-cpg-mssr.h

Corresponding drivers are
    drivers/clk/renesas/clk-rcar-gen2.c
    drivers/clk/renesas/clk-mstp.c
vs.
    drivers/clk/renesas/r8a7795-cpg-mssr.c
    drivers/clk/renesas/renesas-cpg-mssr.c
    drivers/clk/renesas/renesas-cpg-mssr.h
