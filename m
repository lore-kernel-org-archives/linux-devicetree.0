These are OK.

It's not perfect, but now it's done, live with it, this has already been discussed.

Please try to refactor boards DTS with their parent reference design instead
like it was done with the P212 and what I did with the Wetek Hub and Play2.

Well, this is why we have 7 rc releases after the merge window...

Please order S905x after S905d, and we'll be OK.

I'll wait for Kevin's advice, but I'm against these since they are
only purely cosmetic and will break bisect and add unnecessary complexity
to handle further patches on these board.
