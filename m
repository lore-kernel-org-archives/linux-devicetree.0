After a little thinking it is clear to me too that only reason to have 
this overwrite capability is a badly written dai driver. Even with buggy 
HW it should always be possible to present the working modes in daifmt 
terms. Ok, let's remove it.

Here is an updated DT example with updated phandle for master settings:

sound {
     compatible = "simple-audio-card";
     simple-audio-card,name = "Simple Audio";
     simple-audio-card,widgets = ...
     simple-audio-card,routing = ...

     simple-audio-card,dai-link@0 {        /* I2S - codec */
         format = "i2s";
         bitclock-master = <&dai_link_master>
         frame-master = <&dai_link_master>;
         bitclock-inversion;
         simple-audio-card,cpu {
             sound-dai = <&audio1 0>;
         };
         dai_link_master: simple-audio-card,codec {
             sound-dai = <&codec 0>;
             system-clock-frequency = <12000000>;
         };
     };
...

That is a good idea.
