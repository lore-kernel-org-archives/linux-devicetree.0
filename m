The main reason it's so "complex" is the drive for people to have a "one
kernel image for multiple systems" and hence the need to have DT handle
all of this.  I don't think that requirement has been pushed back on the
hardware engineers yet, and they are still thinking that a custom image
per chip is ok.

If the hardware designers don't have that goal, this is just going to
get harder and harder over time, as your systems get more and more
complex.

I love it how it's so easy to make the kernel be the part of the whole
system stack that is simpler to change than any other :)

I'm all for making Linux be the "firmware" and deal with these very
low-level issues directly, but again, this drives in the face of your
self-stated goal of "one image per architecture" for the kernel.  You
kind of can't have it both ways it seems, so someone needs to make up
their mind as to what it's going to be...

Best of luck with this.
