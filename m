This is a common problem for any complex embedded system. Nothing
special about u-boot here. So either we don't need anything because
everyone else has dealt with the problem in some way or we need a
common solution because we all have this problem.

So you don't need this for the common case of an early console, but
only for platforms needing some other platform specific setup?

My point is that if I had to pick how bootloader+dtb+kernel are
bundled or not, I would rather see the dtb in sync with the bootloader
rather than the kernel. But I can't decide that for everyone and
neither can you. You still have a compatibility problem and that has
to be addressed.

If you need certain drivers such as gpio, then you obviously have some
board specific code using those drivers already. If you can tell the
DM which devices to enumerate via DT, you can also tell the DM with C
code.

While doing everything generically without board code is nice, we
should only do that for the common cases and handle the screwy cases
with board code.
