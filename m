Yep, thanks, that's helpful.

Hi Arnd,

Let me describe the top level interface we really need. The objective is 
just to transfer arbitrary data between the two memory spaces (memory on 
the AST2500 as the BMC, where the driver is running, and the memory on 
the host processor). The user on the BMC (in user space; I can't think 
of a use case for another driver needing to access this interface) has 
the host address, transfer size, and, if it's a write, the data. User 
needs to pass this into the driver and, if it's a read, retrieve the 
transferred data.

I did start trying to implement the dmaengine framework, and I think it 
could technically work. The addressing is no longer a problem, thanks to 
your tip. However, I realized there are some other issues.

The main problem is that the only memory that the XDMA engine hardware 
can access is the VGA reserved memory area on the AST2xxx. So I don't 
see how it can ever be a pure dmaengine driver; it would always need an 
additional interface or something to handle that memory area. If I 
completed the dmaengine framework, any and all users would be required 
to go through an additional step to get memory in the reserved area and 
copy in/out of there. The way the driver stands, this memory management 
is integrated, resulting in a fairly clean interface, though of course 
it is unique.

As for the PCIe endpoint part, I'm not sure it fits this driver. I could 
drop the sysfs entries and find another way to configure the SCU for 
now... this driver really doesn't have anything to do with PCIe, except 
for the fact that the XDMA hardware uses PCIe to do the actual work of 
the data transfer.

What do you think? One other thought I had was that the driver might be 
more suitable to go in drivers/soc/ as it is very specific to the 
AST2xxx. But, up to you.

Thanks,

Eddie
