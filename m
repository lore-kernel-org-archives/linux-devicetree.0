OK, that makes sense. I think it's still *possible* that a board might
have the option of more than one partition parser, and so they might
just include both in the DTS, but that seems unlikely and so it makes
sense not to (over)engineer for it before it's needed. Anyway, your
binding can easily be expanded in the future if needed.

No, I think your proposal is OK then. It's possible there is some room
for clarification in the binding, since I was confused, but that could
mostly be attributed to my pre-existing assumptions, not a fault of the
text.

OK, I'll let you know.
