Sounds good.

Apart from the loosy naming practices which we sometimes see (and
which should be caught during review), do you have something against
requiring a name for all new GPIO bindings, i.e. for ensuring that all
new properties are "name-gpio" and forbidding "gpios"?

Requiring a proper name for all GPIOs makes a lot of sense IMHO, it
makes drivers easier to understand and is less error-prone than long
arrays of GPIOs. The API would then be basically what we have today:

gpiod_get(dev, name) // use "name-gpios" with index 0
gpiod_get_index(dev, name, index) // for the rare case where several
GPIOs serve the same function. Not to be used lightly.

... with stronger guidelines for the definition of new bindings, and a
big warning in the kerneldoc of gpiod_get_index().

ACPI drivers that may use tables without _DSD should then use a way to
bind GPIO names to indexes as a fallback for older hardware.
