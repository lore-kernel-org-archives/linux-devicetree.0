If I understand the situation correctly, this is one more instance of
starting to do some work at some point and hoping that something else
that started before has already finished happening. If that's the
case, how does this series make that worst?

During this development I have found many hacks intended to put some
order, even if not enough care was taken to make sure that the order
was guaranteed. In general I would recommend for moving code into
proper drivers and have them to defer the probe of their devices if
some dependency isn't fulfilled at that moment.

Once that's done and we have a safe and reliable boot, we can avoid
those deferred probes by fulfilling the dependency on-demand as this
series shows.

There was some recent thread about how the disabling of unused clocks
and regulators isn't really safe because after late_initcall_sync more
drivers can be registered from modules. Furthermore, there's async
device probes.
