It seems that controllers on these chips are not exactly the same.
They will get different driver data by matching the compatible
strings.  Probably we could define a more generic compatible string,
such as "fsl,layerscape-pcie" or "fsl,ls-pcie".

The binding has mentioned to reference the designware-pcie.txt.  But
it might be more clear to mention the designware compatible string
"snps,dw-pcie" again in the compatible part.  Currently there is no
version number defined in the designware-pcie binding.  It might be
hard to get this information for some SoCs.
