Has been discussed already here:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-May/345835.html

It's an artifact of my development process, I keep the commits in my
local branches without signed off lines and add them before sending out
patches. So whenever I prepare a new revision, collected acks, sobs are
chronological, but end up before my sob.

But since you are the second maintainer which has objection to that
style I probably should change that...

Hm, I agree... FWIW, I copied the code (and that message) from here,
where dev_err is probably also not appropriate:
drivers/regulator/act8865-regulator.c

Hm, maybe we should bail out with an error in that case since DT
explicitly asks to be power controller... Is that what you mean?
