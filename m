This set of patches adds support for audio on the Qualcomm Technologies
ipq806x SOC.

The ipq806x SOC has audio-related hardware blocks in its low-power audio
subsystem (or LPASS).  One of the relevant blocks in the LPASS is its
low-power audio interface (or LPAIF).  This encapsulates the MI2S port,
which is what these drivers are configured to use.  The I2S pins are
connected to an external DAC/amp chip.  In addition, a single GPIO is
connected to the same DAC/amp, which gives the SOC enable/disable
control.

The specific drivers added are:
 - a machine driver that handles the board-specific pins
 - a native driver that handles hardware access to the LPAIF
 - a CPU DAI driver for controlling the LPAIF block
 - a PCM MI2S platform driver

Corresponding additions to the device tree for the ipq806x and its
documentation has also been added.  Also, as this is a new directory,
the MAINTAINERS file has been updated as well.
