I see. That's a relief. It would be problematic if it were
actually CLK_SET_RATE_GATE, and multiple blocks were using
the same PLL, and you tried to switch the display resolution.

It also makes sense. If the PLL is disabled, there is no way
it would lock. Maybe we could skip the lock check if the PLL
is disabled?

OK. I guess it's just eye candy for some of us. The user or
board developer (who is going to use the bindings) shouldn't
care.

Some of the USB clocks have known clock rates. The HSIC 12M
clock here is obviously 12 MHz.

Others such as the OHCI special clocks might run at 48 MHz
from a dedicated PLL. This number is given in the H3 datasheet,
in the USB Host Clock Requirement section.

It's not really a blocking issue as we only ever do enable/disable
on them.
