User is using standard DMA API (single, sg or cyclic) and is agnostic on what is
behind the scene(almost). As driver I just fulfill the request to transfer what
he wants. My driver scatters transfer into SDRAM chunks defined by user.
Unfortunately all transfer are not % the SDRAM size given in DT. This very last
txn is to flush the last expected bytes.
Whatever user set for chaining(bit 2) the DMA API remains the same at its side.
