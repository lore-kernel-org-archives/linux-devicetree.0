This patchset documents a compatible string format that encodes
all the information that was being encoded in qcom specific DT
properties in downstream msm kernels. The goal being to come
up with a format that will allow us to express the information
we want to express without requiring the use of vendor specific
properties. An updated dtbTool will be released after these new
bindings are accepted so that users can work with non-updateable
bootloaders.

This is an attempt to resolve a discussion around March of this year[1]
where the arm-soc maintainers suggested we express this information
through the board's compatible string.

Changes from v1:
 * Remove unused elements (mb, panel, boot device)
 * Remove PMICs from board compatible
 * Add patches to allow us to parse PMIC compatibles with aliases
