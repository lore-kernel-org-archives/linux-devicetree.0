It's not about the crypto, it's about trust.  imho, one of the most
important security advances in the past 20 years is the default use of
git (or other SCMs) by open source projects.  Now, no one is forced to
trust the authors and maintainers tarball dumps.  Regular code audits
and security updates are *much* more feasible because you can audit
small changes.  It can even be automated to a large extent.

All this means the user has a choice: they can trust the authors and
maintainers, or they can trust their own audits.  Since updates are an
essential part of a security posture, small commits facilitate
maintaining the 'trust in audits'.

It's not about "Should you trust free-electrons?"  Or, "Should you trust
Jason / Herbert / Linus?"  It's about "Should you have to trust any of
them?"

Yes, despite my arguments, I'm one of those people.  :-P

We can look at how the wireless drivers handle this.  They often have to
choose between multiple drivers (foss, proprietary, ndis-something, etc)
for a given card.  Not much different here.

I'd appreciate if we'd look into it.  I understand from on-list and
off-list discussion that the rewrite was unavoidable.  So I'm willing to
concede that.  Giving people time to migrate from old to new while still
being able to update for other security fixes seems reasonable.

thx,

Jason.
