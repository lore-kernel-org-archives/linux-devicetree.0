Yes, exactly.

Like fdtget from dtc?  The thing is, this address would only need to be
setup once per board.  Hypothetically, debian's flash-kernel could set
the address in the dtb, then set it in the u-boot environment.  From
then on, only the normal initscript writing to random-seed would be
needed.

thx,

Jason.
