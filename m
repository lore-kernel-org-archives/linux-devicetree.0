Yes, sorry for the confusion on my part.

I think we are absolutely in agreement about the basic principle here,
but disagree on how far we'd want to take the abstraction.

I got a little confused by the leds-gpio example, as I initially saw
that as generic infrastructure rather than a specific driver. As I just
wrote in my reply to Rafael, I generally believe we should strive to
have generic driver-side interfaces so drivers don't have to care,
but keep the differences in subsystem specific code.

I don't actually have a strong opinion on that matter, having only the
device property interface does have some advantages as well, but I also
agree that we are somewhat better off not having to change all the drivers.

I've looked a bit closer at how the LED subsystem handles sub-nodes
in DT at the moment. It seems that there is some duplication between
the drivers already, as they all implement a variation of the sub-node
parsing code.

There are other non-LED drivers with similar loops, but they seem to be
either very specialized, or explicitly for DT abstractions, so I'm still
not convinced we need a generic loop-through-child-nodes-and-parse-properties
interface.

How would you feel about a more general way of probing LED, using
a new helper in the leds-core that iterates over the child nodes
and parses the standard properties but calls into a driver specific
callback to parse the specific properties?
It's probably much more work than your current approach, but it seems
to me that there is more to gain by solving the problem for LED
drivers in particular to cut down the per-driver duplication
at the same time as the per-firmware-interface duplication.

As a start, we could probably take the proposed device_for_each_child_node
and move that into the leds-core, changing the fw_dev_node argument
for an led_classdev with the addition of the of_node and acpi_object
members. It would still leave it up to the gpio-leds driver to do

	if (led_cdev->of_node)
		gpiod = devm_of_get_gpiod(led_cdev->of_node, ...);
	else
		gpiod = devm_acpi_get_gpiod(led_cdev->acpi_object, ...);

but there seems little benefit in abstracting this because there is
only one driver that needs it.
