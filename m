Removing 'ever_enabled' and caching the voltage when 'enabled == -EINVAL'
seems workable.  I'm a little concerned about this resulting in voltage =
regulator-min-microvolt requests being sent for all regulators that are
not explicitly enabled by Linux consumers before late_initcall_sync().
Theoretically all of the boot loader hand-off cases should be taken care
of by this point so it should be safe.

I'll make this change.

Take care,
David
