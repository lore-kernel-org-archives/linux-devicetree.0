We don't do 'simple' or 'generic' bindings.

Sure, but then latter some needs certain timing/ordering of those
controls or some other DT additions. 'generic' or 'simple' never work
out for bindings. By all means though, write a simple/generic phy
driver. Just make it understand an explicit list of compatible
strings. Then when a phy turns out to be not so simple, we can write a
driver for it with changing the DT.

That's not the regulator binding.
