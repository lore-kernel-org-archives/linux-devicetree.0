I've looked at this, and IMHO it's yet another media control API mess.

- media-ctl itself allows setting the format on subdev pads via
  struct v4l2_subdev_format.

- struct v4l2_subdev_format contains a struct v4l2_mbus_framefmt.

- struct v4l2_mbus_framefmt contains:
  * @width:      frame width
  * @height:     frame height
  * @code:       data format code (from enum v4l2_mbus_pixelcode)
  * @field:      used interlacing type (from enum v4l2_field)
  * @colorspace: colorspace of the data (from enum v4l2_colorspace)
  * @ycbcr_enc:  YCbCr encoding of the data (from enum v4l2_ycbcr_encoding)
  * @quantization: quantization of the data (from enum v4l2_quantization)
  * @xfer_func:  transfer function of the data (from enum v4l2_xfer_func)

- media-ctl sets width, height, code and field, but nothing else.

We're already agreed that the fields that media-ctl are part of the
format negotiation between the ultimate source, flowing down to the
capture device.  However, there's no support in media-ctl to deal
with these other fields - so media-ctl in itself is only half-
implemented.

>From what I can tell, _we_ are doing the right thing in imx-media-capture.

However, I think part of the problem is the set_fmt implementation.
When a source pad is configured via set_fmt(), any fields that can
not be altered (eg, because the subdev doesn't support colorspace
conversion) need to be preserved from the subdev's sink pad.

Right now, CSI doesn't do that - it only looks at the width, height,
code, and field.

I think we've got other bugs though that haven't been picked up by any
review - csi_try_fmt() adjusts the format using the _current_
configuration of the sink pad, even when using V4L2_SUBDEV_FORMAT_TRY.
This seems wrong according to the docs: the purpose of the try
mechanism is to be able to setup the _entire_ pipeline using the TRY
mechanism to work out whether the configuration works, before then
setting for real.  If we're validating the TRY formats against the
live configuration, then we're not doing that.

There's calls for:

v4l2_subdev_get_try_format
v4l2_subdev_get_try_crop
v4l2_subdev_get_try_compose

to get the try configuration - we hardly make use of all of these.  I
would suggest that we change the approach to implementing the various
subdevs such that:

1) like __csi_get_fmt(), we have accessors that gets a pointer to the
   correct state for the TRY/live settings.

2) everywhere we're asked to get or set parameters that can be TRY/live,
   we use these accessors to retrieve a pointer to the correct state to
   not only read, but also modify.

3) when we're evaluating parameters against another pad, we use these
   accessors to obtain the other pad's configuration, rather than poking
   about in the state saved in the subdev's priv-> (which is irrelevant
   for the TRY variant.)

4) ensure that all parameters which the subdev itself does not support
   modification of are correctly propagated from the sink pad to all
   source pads, and are unable to be modified via the source pad.
