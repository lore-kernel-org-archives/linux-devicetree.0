I don't think that is a huge danger: most drivers tend to check for
the presence of dev->of_node before calling any of the DT interfaces,
you'd only ever enter the probe function if the compatible string matches
(i.e. an old kernel with a new ACPI table), and most users of ACPI
systems will disable CONFIG_OF at compile time, so the accessors looking
at the of_node are not there.

In theory it's possible that something goes wrong here, but it's not
very likely to ever cause problems.
