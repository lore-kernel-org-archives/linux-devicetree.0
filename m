That's where our points of view differ.  You claim that it becomes
independent of the kernel configuration.  I'm saying that's total
rubbish, because it's dependent on the kernel setting the CPU page
tables up as it does today.

If we set them up differently, then it doesn't work so well.  This
is evidenced by Marvell Armada uniprocessor platforms, where they
are DMA coherent provided that the S bit is set.  However, because
they are uniprocessor platforms, the kernel sets the page tables up
with the S bit clear.  That means that the kernel configures the
system in a way which results in it being non-coherent.

So here, we have an example of why your position is actually incorrect.
dma-coherent does *not* give a "consistent and independent of kernel
configuration" property - it's inherently tied to how the kernel has
setup the page tables.

So, dma-coherent is coherent _provided_ the kernel sets the page tables
up as we currently expect it to - the S bit set on non-LPAE systems, on
LPAE systems, inner-sharable.  If we deviate from that, (eg by clearing
the S bit on non-LPAE systems) we end up with a non-coherent system,
even if dma-coherent is specified.

The Keystone II case is no different - Keystone II is coherent if the
correct conditions are met with the CPU page tables.  The only difference
is that it's a slightly different set of conditions.

How?  We would need to introduce some flag which is passed from the
architecture code into the OF code to disable the effect of dma-coherent,
making of_dma_is_coherent() return false if the S bit is clear.

Yuck.  Seriously?  What happens when we have two devices which have
different required attributes for the CPU mapping?  Should architecture
code have to parse the entire DT tree to work out what attributes each
device needs, and try to then work out how the CPU page tables should
be setup?

I really don't think that's a good idea.
