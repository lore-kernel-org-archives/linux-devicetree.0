Not necessarily, and probably not with LEDE which would treat the
external 53125 as a dumb switch and not even see it. With a mainline
kernel and the B53 DSA driver you would be able to represent both
switches in Device Tree and describe how they are cascading from each other.

The potential Device Tree changes could look like this (based on your
explanation, but I am not sure) for your platform, assuming the 53125 is
actually exposing the front panel ports and that we did introduce a
"mdio" node which would be required to expose the external BCM53125 switch.


/* There is no MDIO node, there should be one */
&mdio {
	status = "okay";

	switch@30 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reset-gpios = <&gpio 10>;

                	#address-cells = <1>;
	                #size-cells = <0>;

        	        port@0 {
                	        reg = <0>;
                        	label = "lan1";
	                };

	                port@1 {
        	                reg = <1>;
                	        label = "lan2";
                	};

	                port@2 {
        	                reg = <2>;
                	        label = "lan3";
                	};

        	                reg = <3>;
                	        label = "lan1";
                	};

	                port@4 {
        	                reg = <4>;
                	        label = "wan";
                	};

 	               port@5 {
        	                reg = <5>;
                	        label = "cpu";
                        	ethernet = <&sw0port8>;
				fixed-link {
					speed = <1000>;
					full-duplex;
				};
                	};
		};
	};
};

&srab {
        status = "okay";
