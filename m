Probably we can populate the platform devices from device tree after
the device_init phase?  So that all built-in drivers are already
registered when the devices are created and we can try find the best
match in one go?  For more specific loadable modules we probably need
to unbind from the old driver and bind to the new one.  But I agree
with you that it could be messy.

Maybe not a new issue but "snps,dw-pcie" is competing with various
"fsl,<chip>-pcie" compatibles.  Also a specific PHY
"ethernet-phy-idAAAA.BBBB" with generic "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c45".
