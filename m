No, the property above is for a bus that extends from
0x40.00000000 to 0x43f.ffffffff

The first tuple is the address that is used for the local
bus, the second one is the address that it gets translated to
on the parent bus, and the third tuple is the length.

It has absolutely nothing to do with where the DDR memory resides,
only which addresses are valid on a particular bus, like the
ranges property for the opposite direction. This is usually set
up in some control register for the bus, and you should use the
same value here.
