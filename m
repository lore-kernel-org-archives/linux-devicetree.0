Assume you reject to use compatible string.

Could you make it more clear? kernel global variable, macro, or function?

- Following your idea, I think, we can add in driver/cpufreq/cpufreq.c:
int (*clk_reg_cpufreq_get_op_table) (struct op_table *tbl, int *size);
SoC code set the callback. If it's NULL, driver will exit. We can get rid
of DT. It'll make cpufreq core dirty, but it's the only file built-in.

- Drop module support. SoC call generic_clk_cpufreq_init as Jamie said.

current cpufreq core only support one cpufreq_driver. Others will fail
except the first time.

We'd better keep cpufreq core simple. For this driver, register cpufreq_driver
is the last thing after checking all conditions.

You are right. Thanks.
