Hi Russell!

Thanks for your notes!

Good - this way, I can move dmaengine_slave_config() to the dma_setup()
function, i.e., to probe().

However, I needed to set it there to some initial value (e.g., DMA_DEV_TO_MEM) -
otherwise the amba-pl08x driver didn't accept it. Is this a bug in the pl08x
driver?

Can we remove the .direction element from the struct dma_slave_config to prevent
others from making the same mistakes? Or is it useful for sth. else still?

Thanks for pointing this out - I wasn't aware that the distinction between the
two is so important. Also consider e.g.:

arch/arm/mm/dma-mapping.c:
/**
 * dma_map_sg - map a set of SG buffers for streaming mode DMA
 * @dev: valid struct device pointer, or NULL for ISA and EISA-like devices
 * @sg: list of buffers
 * @nents: number of buffers to map 
 * @dir: DMA transfer direction
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 *
[...]
 * Device ownership issues as mentioned for dma_map_single are the same
 * here.
 */
int dma_map_sg(struct device *dev, struct scatterlist *sg, int nents,
                enum dma_data_direction dir)
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
;-)
