this dependency is now queued in Kevin's linux-amlogic tree (and the
pull request for the corresponding clock driver updates is waiting to
be merged as well).

could you please have a look at these patches specifically? please let
me know if these are fine
will you take these patches through some ARM tree or should Kevin take
them through his linux-amlogic tree (I assume that Kevin can simply
take all other patches, as the other ones can go the standard route
for arch/arm/mach-meson, dt-bindings documentation and .dts changes)?
