That's an ambiguous definition.
You can have 16 ports per the SoundWire spec, but DP0 is reserved for 
control and DP15 is an alias for all ports (same idea as device 15 for 
broadcast operations but limited to a single device), which leaves 14 
ports for audio usages.

In the MIPI specs, specifically the DisCo part, the difference is called 
about with the the DP0 and DPn notations, so this could be SDW_MAX_DPn. 
Alternatively you could use SDW_MAX_AUDIO_PORTS which is more 
self-explanatory and does not require in-depth familiarity with the spec.
