This matches with what I know but it seems anyway that in the arm,primecell
cases this is not a great concern, almost none of the dts currently in
mainline go as far as specifying the machine specific name.

After thinking at it a bit, I also prefer to leave the guessing out. It
can break things in non-obvious ways. I prefer a full consistent and
testable behaviour.
