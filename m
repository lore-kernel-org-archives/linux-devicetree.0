Ok, I see. I thought that this was what the labels in the dtb were supposed
to be used for. Can't you do the same thing in u-boot by using a label
as opposed to the alias?

IIRC you should be able to add an additional label like

+&mdio0 {
+       enet1_sgmii_phy: sgmii_phy0: ethernet-phy@0 {
+               reg = <0x0>;
+       };

and then use libfdt to find the node through that, rather than through
the alias. I don't know how things are handled on other platforms, but
I think that was how it was initially thought up when we introduced
the fdt format on PowerPC.
