What's a "clock mapping" style binding? I guess that means the style
where you have a single DT node that provides multiple clocks, rather
than one DT node per clock?

If the kernel driver changes its internal data, I don't see why that
would have any impact at all on the DT binding definition. We should be
able to use one DT binding definition with arbitrary drivers.

Can you expand upon why a DT that encodes register-level details is more
useful? I can't see why there would be any difference in usefulness.
