According to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt:
"GPIO properties should be named "[<name>-]gpios", with <name> being the pu=
rpose
of this GPIO for the device. While a non-existent <name> is considered vali=
d
for compatibility reasons (resolving to the "gpios" property), it is not al=
lowed
for new bindings. Also, GPIO properties named "[<name>-]gpio" are valid and=
 old
bindings use it, but are only supported for compatibility reasons and shoul=
d not
be used for newer bindings since it has been deprecated."

So it should be "reset-gpios" for new bindings.

Also, sound/soc/codecs/tlv320aic3x.c still uses "gpio-reset", and I do
not see any patch in your series changing this:
ret =3D of_get_named_gpio(np, "gpio-reset", 0);

Same remarks for your "[PATCH 6/9] ARM: dts: imx: Fix the audio
CODEC's reset pin". I don't know if there are other DTS files using
this, but they should all be updated accordingly. This would anyway
break all of the out-of-tree DTS files using this, which I think is
not allowed, so the driver should be changed in a way still allowing
the legacy naming besides the new one.

Best regards,
Beno=C3=AEt
