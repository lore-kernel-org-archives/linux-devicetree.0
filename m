s/bloat/churn/

The clock _data_ seems to always have some churn to it. Moving it out to
DT reduces that churn from Linux. My concern above is not about kernel
data size.

Absolutely you could put this stuff in C. Originally all of the clock
registration mechanisms in the common clock implementation assumed
static data in the kernel. That's how it used to be.

However DT came along to ARM and the clock framework and these "clock
mapping" bindings started popping up, which are fragile. Adding a clock
requires changes both to the DT binding AND to the kernel. That sucks.

Once again I'll point out that this binding (mux-clock) makes it so that
devices with simpler clock trees do not need to merge any code into the
kernel. What value does device tree bring to me if for every platform
with 8 clocks I have to write a new Linux clock driver with that static
data in it? That also sucks. In that case DT brings almost zero value,
with the exception of linking clock phandles to clock consumers, which
clkdev had been doing for us already.
