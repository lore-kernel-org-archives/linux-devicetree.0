do you have any suggestion about other function that I can use? is
devm_regmap_init_mmio() feasible

I'm not sure what's the valid point of removing compatible 'syscon' in
driver/mfd/syscon.c, sounds this will break a lot DT/or need to fix?
will you propose a patch for this? then I can certainly adjust here

Yes, the SD_EMMC_CLOCK register contain several bits which not fit well
into common clock model, and they need to be access in the NAND or eMMC
driver itself, Martin had explained this in early thread[1]

In this register
Bit[31] select NAND or eMMC function
Bit[25] enable SDIO IRQ
Bit[24] Clock always on
Bit[15:14] SRAM Power down

No, and current eMMC driver still use iomap to access the register

I think we probably would like to take two steps approach.
first, from the hardware perspective, the NAND and eMMC(port C) driver
can't exist at same time, since they share the pins, clock, internal
ram, So we have to only enable one of NAND or eMMC in DT, not enable
both of them.
Second, we might like to convert eMMC driver to also use mmc-clkc model.
