Build the dtb file for these platfroms with __symbol__ information
included.  This will reduce the size of the dtb (and resident memory
usage) in exchange for allowing more types of overlays to be applied to
the dtb file prior to passing it to Linux and additional functionality
within the kernel when OF_OVERLAY is enabled.

This patch takes the path that Rob encouraged in my previous patch of
enabling __symbols__ in some platforms now (that can use it) and see if
a critical mass evolves that pushes towards -@ being default for all
dtbs.  I would suggest that the dra76 series be respun to include a hunk
like this at least as well, and if there's another Beagle X15 patch,
that too.  Russell, per some of our conversations, something like would
also be needed as part of using overlays to solve some of the problems
with Hummingboard, etc.
