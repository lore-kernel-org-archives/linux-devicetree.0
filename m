IMHO, making a driver DT-aware should never really depend on re-writing
the core driver itself but help the subsystem to build up proper driver-
specific structs from it. When I started to make Armada DRM to work with
DT, I didn't look for places to modify the driver but what it expects
in terms of resources. So, for Armada DRM and most likely most SoC DRM
drivers DT should only be used to build up the platform_data required
for the driver.

IIRC, in the early DT days, everybody of_iomap'ed resources, with
device core translating those to resources you can limit some drivers
to the match table to make it DT aware. I guess this also has to be
done within other subsystems, drm and propably asoc too.

What DT really allows us to do, is describing dependencies between
nodes, i.e. RGB scan-out connected to HDMI transmitter on I2C bus
foo. That is what we really should exploit to build up a proper
representation of the devices used for e.g. a video card. Except some
very IP specific properties, there should be no need to parse the
DT yourself. Of course, there will be over-complicated boards or
designs that make it hard to deal with, but it would have been with or
without DT.

I definitely may have a limited view over the overall complexity
involved especially with non-SoC drivers. Nonetheless, I am looking
forward to meet some of you at ELCE and get more insight in this.

Aren't there proposals for DT schematas that could possibly solve this?
