Indeed

 I've actually put a note in the cover letter to highlight special
attention needed for patch 7, but turns out rely on maintainers to
handle the dependencies isn't a wise idea
 Lesson has been learned here, and I'll handle dependencies myself next
time.

as already replied in my previous email, again here is my approach

a) I'll send patch 2-6, just leave out patch 7 for now, and as patch 1
is already accepted.. this way it won't break gxbb/gxl (the OLD SoC)
b) will pin you to require DT patch merged or re-send if necessary (as
till now the clkao driver is merged)
c) send out the patch 7 for UART AO clock fix

this is exactly what Jerome suggested..

Thank you
