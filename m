Discussed with Maxime. Will switch to "mc_smp" instead. The "mc" part
is there to differentiate with some old smp code we have for the A31
and A23.

This was indeed the problem. Don't know why I missed it considering I
had added them for other parts in my full assembly patches...

I've tried all the tricks to jump from ARM to Thumb. Then it occurred
to me, __pa_symbol() would set the lowest bit for Thumb symbols. So I
tried just using cpu_resume for the trampoline re-entry point, and it
worked.

I went back and checked the BROM code. It does

    ldr pc, <entry_code_address>

which I assume is the same as

    ldr ip, <entry_code_address>
    bx ip

Indeed just fixing the alignment issue above made it work.

This doesn't really work. The spinlock code are still Thumb instructions
and the assembler complains.

I tried this before but...

as mentioned above the BROM does branch correctly and it was the .word
.alignment that was the culprit.

Thanks for all the feedback!
