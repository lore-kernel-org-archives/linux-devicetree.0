Reusing obsolete modifiers is dangerous from many reasons:

   + people might miss the change of the meaning
   + backporting mistakes
   + 3rd party modules

It might be acceptable if the long term gain is bigger
than a short time difficulties. But it would be better
to it a safe way when possible.

Fortunately, we could keep the backward compatibility
for "%pf" and handle only "%pfw*" with the fwnode api.
