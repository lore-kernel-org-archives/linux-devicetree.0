When I was looking at your comments again for fixing them, I just
realized that I hadn't answered part of this question. In the recent
OMAPs, memory chips are stacked on to the OMAP, hence board layout etc
doesn't figure in the equation. The only board level details that we
need to program the memory controller are the details about the memory
device itself, which is what this binding is targeting.
