OK.

No, I'm just being remarkably thick today. Sorry about the noise.

Either that, or you keep a separate GICP probing. Up to you, really.

Yeah, that'd help.

OK. Can you expose both interrupts in the DT already, assuming this
doesn't break anything? Wasting an SPI is not that big a deal, and I
want to make sure we'll have a smooth upgrade path when transitioning
from the irqchip hack to the ahci solution.
