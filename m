In the probe function ?

If every driver writer would use that line of argument, booting would
take much longer than necessary, with every process sitting on unnecessary
wait or sleep calls for perceived "optimization" purposes. Probe functions
run exactly once, and should be time optimized. You should have an idea
what the minimum reset hold time is, and follow it.

It appears to be somewhat unlikely that each keypress resulted in a driver
being instantiated. If it did, a sleep in its probe function was the least
of your problems.

Correct.
