My understanding of the i.MX clock tree naming in the docs, though, is
that the names in the DT don't match the ones in the docs, regardless.

I also don't understand how lots of nodes in a tree *is* lots of
bloat, by Shawn's definition, but lots of entirely Linux- and
common-clock-framework-specific names in a table *isn't* bloat even if
most of these clocks and names are not used for devices in the tree
anyway.

Device trees shouldn't encode data that is entirely specific to a
Linux driver. Even if the only user is Linux, you are not describing
the Linux driver, you are describing the hardware. The names match the
hardware specification in the CCM chapters of the manual, but just
barely. All Shawn has done here is make the lookup in the DT, which is
at the very least internally consistent (it's not referencing the
order of an array elsewhere than the device tree), but an index into
an array of strings is not the way we generally encode things in
device trees since the dawn of time, and certainly shouldn't be
acceptable behavior now.

I might agree somewhat with Shawn that encoding every clock for the
chip in the tree (some 190+ entries) and it's bits and entries is a
ridiculous amount, but most boards don't need all the clocks or
selects defined if they're not using those peripherals. There are ways
to make sure boards do not over-define their clock tree (and any
clocks not defined will not get enabled anyway).

That the clock tree is SoC-specific doesn't mean it should not be
encoded in the tree; the fact that Sascha could write a fairly
comprehensive common clock subsystem shows that for certain families
of SoC, certain groupings of clock mux, select and associations
between unit clock (for instance to write to registers) and peripheral
output clock (for instance to clock data to an MMC card or SPI bus or
whatever) are fairly "common" as it stands. What is not common is the
naming and the meaning of that naming, which in the end is only useful
to drivers as debugging information anyway.

What I don't get is why you'd implement a clock lookup as <&clk 160>
<&clk 161> and then futher give them names like "ipg" "per", even if
these were seperate clocks, it makes no sense to NAME them. If clock
160 is "uart_ipg" and 161 is "uart_serial", what are you gaining from
the clock-names property inside the actual device definition? You're
encoding the "ipg" root clock name twice, and "per" doesn't make any
sense here.

What's the difference with moving ALL the definitions of clock values
from the driver (such as arch/arm/mach-imx/clk-mx51-mx53.c) into the
DT and parsing it all out of the DT? Once it's registered then you
have to look it up by name, but if each DT driver node (uart@ for
example) references the clock node by phandle, it will be able to look
up that exact clock by that phandle, correct? What I'm confused about
right now is what the difference is between naming them "ipg" and
"per" vs. "donkey" and "shrek"? This is just a driver-specific naming
such that it can find these things and turn on and off the right
clocks at the right time, but it doesn't make any sense to refer to
the CCM node, then an index to a an array of names, then two more
names defining the clock definition. uart_serial cannot be used for
ANYTHING besides the uart "per" clock, so just encode this as a clock
type in the individual clock node. The clkdev subsystem can resolve
"per" to some magic value or the string in the tree...

uart_ipg_clk: clock@foo {
     clock-name = "uart";
     fsl,clock-type = "ipg";
     ...
};

uart@bar {
     clocks = <&uart_ipg_clk, &uart_per_clk>
};

I counted here and we're not "bloating" anything in terms of bytes
used to define the clocks - what we save in not doing an array lookup,
we lose in defining a node. Tthis is not going to end the world. What
you "waste" in the device tree, you get to automate in the Linux
driver anyway and remove a bunch of tables, which is what Shawn's
trying to do anyway. If the UART driver needs to do;

        sport->clk_ipg = devm_clk_get(&pdev->dev, "ipg");

Then it has all the information it needs here; one of the phandle
references points to a clock which has "ipg" as it's fsl,clock-type
property. Or something else.

It is going to be an SoC-specific binding, that's for sure, but since
there is a definition for a fixed clock, why can't there be a
definition for a gated clock (enable/disable), mux select defined as a
group and possible selections, and the right clocks being defined with
the right potential parents? The entire clock tree AND it's lookups
can be built from device tree, per documentation, per actual SoC
layout and the driver has to live with getting the information from
somewhere other than the heady mix of a table in DT, and a table in
Linux which don't necessarily depend on each other?

You only have to do these lookups once when the clock subsystem starts
on Linux, it's not like every time you want to go find a clock you
have to actually enter a firmware interface, parse the entire device
tree, come back out with a small snippet of data and then go off and
do the stuff; it's been put in a readily-accessible structure, and
gets done at device probe. Register them at boot, find them in the
clock subsystem, you're ready to go.

I would rather see every clock defined in the tree, as much "bloat" as
you would seem to think it is, it makes no sense to have a huge table
of clock definitions who's names and numbers are defined in the device
tree, yet register offsets and bit widths and values and defaults and
parents are defined in the driver itself along with lots of other
lists and tables. The table in the DT is making a huge assumption
about the subsystem needs to do the clock lookups and the way the
*Linux drivers* themself actually works; this is wrong, wrong, wrong
on so many levels.

You only need to define the inputs and outputs you use, and in the end
I think referencing an array of strings by phandle and index into a
property contained in that handle, then looking up another string in
it's own device node to make sure which clock is which, is more
complex and takes longer than referencing a clock by phandle and
looking at two specific properties defining that clock. If we're going
this far, we should DEFINITELY be encoding the clock subsystems in the
SoC entirely in the device tree and automating clock setup. If the
common clock framework lives up to it's name, all you'd need is a
single arch/arm/mach-imx/clk.c to map the specific operation for every
i.MX SoC (i.e. bindings for i.MX) and not one for *every* i.MX SoC,
and all this data can be adequately encoded in the DT.
