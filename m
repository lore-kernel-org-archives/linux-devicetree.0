ok. This is on zynq platform which enables ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM.
It means that both these options are enabled by default and

Does it mean what Russel mention that within means from ram start address
+ 16MB (from my test that limit is 128MB - but maybe memory tests can
find some bugs
but the kernel boots)

The fact is that I can't disabled these options because of
ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM option.
I am running AMP which means on the second ARM runs rtos.
Rtos on the second cpu needs to access vectors started at 0x0 that's
why I need to move
the kernel to higher addresses.

As I see from the exynos4210-origen.dts they use 4 memory banks
        memory {
                reg = <0x40000000 0x10000000
                       0x50000000 0x10000000
                       0x60000000 0x10000000
                       0x70000000 0x10000000>;
        };

I expect that kernel starting address is 0x40000000 (+0x8000) and
everything works as expected
but if they will try to use( without changing dts which describe exact
and real hardware configuration)
0x50000000 starting address than kernel won't boot.
What it is interesting on this is that Linux can work with all memory
banks which are in DTS
on higher addresses than starting address but can't work with memory
banks which are on lower addresses.

That's why I have created these patches (it is just c&p just to see
what I am talking about)
which ensure that kernel will boot not failed in these two cases.

Case 1:
The kernel starting address is at 0x10008000
dts memory reg = <0x0 0x40000000>;
which ensure that kernel will work only with 0x10000000 - 0x40000000
address space
Kernel bootlog will contain: "Change memory bank to 10000000-3fffffff"

Case 2:
In two bank solution with the kernel starting address at 0x10008000
will be the first bank ignored
which ensure that HIGHMEM will work and kernel will boot
reg = <0x0 0x10000000 0x10000000 0x30000000>;
Kernel bootlog will contain: "Ignoring RAM at 00000000-0fffffff

Also these two patches ensure that kernel can be placed to any memory location
and will work with the rest of memory which is defined in the dts
without changing
dts to reflect different loading address.

Michal
