Richard, this design isn't going to work. We need to have both kernel
and user space consumers. We don't want all GPIO's in a common timestamp
buffer either, as it presents problems I mentioned previously. Currently
the network input is a gpio. After some discussion here I think we'll
have to keep this driver out of the kernel for now.

Thanks.
