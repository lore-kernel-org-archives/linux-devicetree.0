It's arguable that this irq_set_irq_type(,NONE) shouln't be there but
still ... it's been around for ever and things worked :-) So something
-else- is causing the problem and I'd like to understand what exactly.

(When I say arguable, I do mean it. There are some reasons to keep it
even if we agree that it's not "setting a default" but marking the
interrupt as somewhat disabled as Russell wants, that's fine with me, an
MPIC external interrupt should -always- have a proper type set before
being used).

First we need to fix that business with NR_IRQS/nr_irqs everywhere, then
if the problem persists, check why we aren't calling the proper
irq_set_irq_type() after the mapping is established (we should be).

Cheers,
Ben.
