That is a _Linux_ detail, not a _UEFI_ detail.

Anything which only handles UEFI and knows nothing of reserved-memory
(e.g. GRUB) will be broken and/or break the Linux use of the region, as
it will happily try to allocate memory in the region (and could even
decide to reserve it permanently for its own usage).

If the memory is truly specific to the mailbox, then UEFI needs to know
that it is reserved as such. If it is not, then it need not be described
in the DT and can be allocated dynamically by the kernel.

It shouldn't need to change if that memory is truly reserved for the
sole use of the mailbox. If that's not the case then we have a different
issue.

If the memory range to use can be allocated by the driver, then I don't
see why it should be described in reserved-memory. It certainly should
not require a no-map attribute.

Additionally, the driver needs to ensure that the requisite cache
maintenance takes place prior to the use of the memory region given
prior agents may have ampped it as cacheable, leaving stale (perhaps
dirty) lines in the caches.

I did _not_ suggest that Leo use discrete memory. I suggested that
reserved regions should not be described in the memory node (the same
premise applying to the UEFI memory map).

w.r.t. UEFI, please see my comments above. If you're using the UEFI
memory map, you have to use the UEFI memory map, not the UEFI memory map
with additional (non-UEFI) caveats applied atop.

This relies on Linux, and ignores other UEFI clients.

I did not say that.

I said that describing some memory in a memory node, then also
describing that in reserved-memory with a no-map property was wrong. If
it's never meant to be mapped then there's no reason for it to be in the
memory node.

The memory node describes the memory available to the OS. There are some
caveats w.r.t. /memreserve/, regions which may be mapped but remain
unused and so on, but the memory node does generally encode a policy
that the memory may be used.

Describing unusable memory in a memory node is pointless, and has an
adverse effect on clients which don't support reserved-memory. It's
doubly harmful when that memory should never be mapped.

Thanks,
Mark.
