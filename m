So we'll get a new binding when that happens? That will break 
compatibility.

If we wanted a generic mechanism for single register bits/fields in DT, 
we'd have one already. A node per register bit doesn't scale.

Maybe this should be modelled using GPIO binding? There's a line there 
too as whether the signals are "general purpose" or not.
