Am happy to be one.

Sure, Will do it in next version.

Yes, I can see more than 60% of them are atmel,at24* eeproms in DT. We 
have some plans to migrate at24 and at25 eeproms to this framework once 
the the framework itself is accepted.

Correct me if I miss understood.
Is serial number any different?
Am hoping that the eeprom consumer would be aware of offset and size of 
serial number in the eeprom

Cant the consumer do:

eeprom-consumer {
	eeproms = <&at24 0 4>;
	eeprom-names = "device-serial-number";
};
