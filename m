Yes. There has basically been zero traction on that front. I'm trying to
push a scheme that requires minimal changes to dtc itself in the hope
that will move /something/ forward at greater than zero speed.

I've come around to thinking that using something external to dtc is
actually very advantageous. The main benefit here is that a C-syntax
(well, cpp-syntax) header file can be included by both DT code and C
code, and hence there's no need to duplicate the constant definitions.
Equally, this way, anyone is free to go ahead and use whatever tools
they want for the pre-processing; as long as a valid DT comes out the
end of it, dtc can eat it. This gives us flexibility to change solutions
without having to change dtc. Plus, we don't all have to be
language-lawyers and invent yet another language inside dtc; all the
parts are already written for us, except for a tiny amount of glue.
