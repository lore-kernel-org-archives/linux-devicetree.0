Currently, the ASoC machine driver is responsible for requesting a 
certain frequency of MCLK be generated from our driver and then also 
sending the frequency information along to the external device (codec).
This is done via the snd_soc_dai_set_sysclk.  That is the only clock 
interaction we have needed for the core part of the driver.  For 
enhanced features, we also have the need to make minor adjustments 
(tweaks) to the PLL.  The tweaks are used to make the PLLs output 
frequency match as closely as possible to a true reference frequency. 
As such, we would like to provide the finest adjustment resolution as 
possible. The clocking framework only seems to allow for a 1 Hz 
adjustment. This limitation and the fact that no other device seems to 
need to interact directly will the PLL are why we have not put it in the 
clocking framework.
