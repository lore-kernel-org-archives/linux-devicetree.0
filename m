Arnd,

As the driver is responsible for configuring the device to support the 
device functionality, it make sense to do this in the device driver. The 
driver enables clock to the IP and this is an addition thing to be 
configured so that when the device is powered up, it should function as 
RC. The IP can be configured to work as Root Complex or Endpoint. So not 
sure why you want to me to move this functionality to boot loader.
