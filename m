The PXA platform CPU DAI still has it, and grepping also reveals some 
Freescale and Samsung platforms.

If that's considered legacy, we shouldn't add bindings for it of course. 
I can look into the PXA driver and see if it can auto-detect the 
dividers itself. It won't be straight forward though as the clocking 
setup also depends on configurations such as TDM slots, external vs. 
internal clocks etc. Meh.


Thanks,
Daniel
