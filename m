OK, so the number actually is an arbitrary piece of data associated
with the key "port" and the interpretation of that piece of data
depends on whoever asks for that value.

IOW, the core doesn't care.

With all due respect to whoever invented this on the DT side, this is
just bad design to me, because it causes the "port" property to serve
two different purposes at the same time.  First, it tells the core
that this object is a port.  Second, it is expected to provide a piece
of data of unspecified interpretation to somebody.  Which means that
the "port" property is both general and device-specific at the same
time and the sanity of that is quite questionable IMO.

Thanks,
Rafael
