You make a fair point, and I'd much rather it was bullet proof.

Ok, will look at adding set() and get() functions for the controls affected.

That's fine if the registers are clumped closely together. Will have a look and
see if it works out cleaner. Thanks.

Ok, will add comments to clarify.

Yes, there's a disable_pin() call for micbias. However that will not
disable the pin indefinitely which is what I would require for this. I need to
know that there's no chance of the pin being enabled prior to jack insertion.

Agreed. Will update accordingly.

If I had used bulk_read() and an array of 2 u8 values instead, and then
converted what was read into a u16, would that have been better/clearer? I can
do that, but figured this might be a more elegant soluion. Either, way I'll
add some comments to clarify what's going on.

Ok, understood.

Ok, thanks. Will update.

Just didn't seem necessary. However, will change it as requested.
