Hi,

here is an updated version of the imx-drm DT binding series.
These patches apply on top of Russell's imx-drm-staging branch
that just got merged int staging-next. I have added device tree
bindings between IPU and the encoders as documented in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt
and used those to determine the possible_crtcs and mux_id,
and to find all necessary components that hang off of the display
interface ports.
This allows to move the imx-drm node into the SoC level dtsi.
The existing i.MX51 and i.MX53 device trees are updated and device
tree binding documentation is included.

Changes since v3:
 - Kept the -EPROBE_DEFER in of_parse_endpoint and removed LVDS
   output ports for now. This can be revisited once drm_panel support
   is added.
 - Dropped the temporary of_graph helper copies, so this depends on
   the patch that moves the v4l2_of helpers to drivers/of.

regards
Philipp
