This patch adds the device tree support for FSL LS2088A SoC based on
ARMv8 architecture.

Following levels of DTSI/DTS files have been created for the LS2088A
SoC family:

     - fsl-ls2088a.dtsi:
            DTS-Include file for FSL LS2088A SoC.

     - fsl-ls2088a-qds.dts:
            DTS file for FSL LS2088A QDS board.

     - fsl-ls2088a-rdb.dts:
            DTS file for FSL LS2088A RDB board.

Changes for v4:
	- Incorporated Shawn's comments by reorganizing
          DTSI, moving all include definations to the top
	- add missing files
Changes for v2:
	- reorganize LS2088A device tree to use common
	  nodes from LS2080A device trees.
