I believe this is necessary for all the platforms where the UART has a 
clock described in the firmware.

This workaround was first required on the arndale. Note that UART on 
Juno r2 has a clock described but 'clk_ignore_unused' is not necessary. 
I am wondering why it is working.

The number of devices used by Xen is very limited (UART, timer and 
SMMU). However we may also want to consider device passthrough where a 
clock would be handled by another guest.
