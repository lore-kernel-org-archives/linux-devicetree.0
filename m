This is like template/wrappers, smart card phy driver will write API 
functions. And smartcard controller will call these functions.
With proposed approach, smartcard controller can communicate with any 
smart card phy (TI/NxP) without change in code. Using DT entry smartcard 
and PHY will gets connected with each other.
Refer diagram given @Documentation/sc_phy.txt.
