I had a closer look, but I'm sorry, I don't really see how
drivers/power/reset can help here. In drivers/power/reset, there are
only drivers that handle powering off a platform, or rebooting a
platform. They hook up by setting a value to the pm_power_off and/or
arm_pm_restart function pointers.

But in my case, what's needed is neither a power off nor a reboot, but
an entry to suspend to RAM, which is a different state. I don't see how
the drivers/power/reset driver would get "called" by the suspend/resume
procedure.

I also don't see how notifiers can help here. On which notification
would the drivers/power/reset driver register itself? By creating a new
notification type, specific to the mvebu platform?

I'm fine with reworking the implementation I've proposed, but if you
could shed some more light on what your proposal would look like, it
would be useful, as I currently don't see how drivers/power/reset fits
the need of the Armada XP suspend/resume mechanism.

Thanks,

Thomas
