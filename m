Hi PrasannaKumar,

thanks for taking the time to review my submission.

A couple of files in drivers/char/hw_random have the same copyright
statement. So it looks like copy&paste. I'll remove it.

You're right. I'll fix this.

That looks like mxc-rnga.c was taken as a starting point. I'll change
__raw_read() to readl and __raw_writel to writel.

Ok, I'll move the check right after reading the status register.

The "key" is probably the internal state of the PRNG, which uses the
mechanism described in FIPS 186-2.

No idea why Freescale added this check before the self test. I guess
that we can safely run the self test and check for errors afterwards.
I'll remove the check.

Interestingly, this "bad key" error status is one of the few differences
between RNGB and RNGC, both of which should work with this driver...

Agreed. Switching the clock on should be sufficient to get the
oscillator to run. And if not, we should see an error after the self
test.

I'd say the self test should be run once when the driver is loaded. I'll
try to move the self test to the probe function.

Ok.

I doubt that I have enough info to set the quality. I'll see what I can
dig up.

I'll try to upload v4 as soon as possible.

Thanks,
