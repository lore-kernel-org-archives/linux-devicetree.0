Yeah, it's kind of a mixture of board/soc bindings mostly with some
ARM architecture, ARM, Ltd. IP, and SoC system reg bindings.

Eventually, I'd like to not split board bindings by arch and maybe we
should move all the system/misc reg bindings out.

This I believe is mostly SoC system reg bindings though there's
probably a few other things.

Top-level SoC/board bindings in arm/ and anything else elsewhere ideally.
