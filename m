The idea here is to have a generic driver, if a driver needs to know
about a specific clock, it will likely be another device specific
driver and it can use its own dt-bindings and clock names. I believe
that for a generic driver meant to cover common hardware configs,
simply having X clks and then on power_on enabling clk1, then clk2,
then clk3, etc. and on power off do the same in reverse other is
a good approach.

I don't know about data-sheets, but an example of a driver
with 3 clocks is drivers/usb/host/ohci-at91.c fwiw it uses
"uhpck", "hclk" and "usb_clk" as clk names.
