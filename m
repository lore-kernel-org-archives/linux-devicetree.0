That's weird, because I sent it all with git send-email and the
patches did reach lkml [1] and patchwork has them too [2][3]. I
have also verified that you were indeed on the Cc list, and I have
not seen any errors (yet). I'm not sure if it's going to matter if
I send them again, or if it is fastest/simplest for you to get them
from patchwork?

Cheers,
Peter
