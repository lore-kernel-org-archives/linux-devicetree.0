Yes, a machine driver is quite a sane way to manage the huge range of
variability of a machine's audio complex.  If it turns out that an SoC
only ever has one machine driver that handles all possible
configurations, it still isn't really more complex.  If, however, the
permutations are sufficiently different to warrant separate driver
then the groundwork is already established to support it sanely.

BTW, this isn't a question about "what OF is all about".  It makes
perfect sense in the OF context to have a node describing how multiple
devices are aggregated into a single logically composite device.

Do a machine driver.  It's the right thing to do.
