I'm honestly not sure if we have much of a choice right now. I've only
recently hit the stable ABI wall, which effectively keeps me from adding
new functionality. Even worse, the matter isn't that some patches would
need more work or anything, but the problem is that we can't merge code
until everybody and their cat has acked the patches, or more precisely,
the DT bindings. Typically this is a subsystem maintainer, the port
maintainer and now with DT also the device tree binding maintainers.
That's an awful lot of people you have to convince. In this particular
case these patches were even required to be acked by yet another group
of people.

Now, I can't blame anyone in particular and I certainly made my own set
of mistakes in the process, but the issue is systemic. If you need to
run a set of patches by three or four groups of people, each with their
own set of interests, it becomes very difficult to find any sort of
concensus. And not only that: it also means that every group needs to
find the time to at least look at the patches and to some degree
understand it.

So instead of requiring concensus on the binding from everyone involved,
I went to investigate alternative means to get the code out and provide
new features to our users with the goal to migrate to a proper device
tree binding incrementally. The problem is that we can't expose all the
device nodes in DT because their bindings haven't been acknowledged, but
without a device node there won't be a device for the driver to bind
against. So the obvious solution seemed to be to just create the device
programmatically. Naively I thought: "Well, this won't be pretty, but
it should be easy."

Far from it. It turns out to be very difficult to do. With all the
cross-referencing that DT allows to do so easily, the same is very
cumbersome to do with code. Not only do you need to look up device nodes
by path, but you also need to do things like fixing up phandles because
the DT doesn't contain them for all nodes, yet the kernel needs them to
look up the corresponding devices.

Once you've actually created a device node, you still need to inject it
into what the device tree core created from the DTB at boot time. Turns
out that there's actually some code to do that, but it requires the
OF_DYNAMIC option to be selected. Turning that on triggers a couple of
warnings because code doesn't take and drop references on device nodes
properly.

To round things off there's the problem on how to preserve compatibility
with future device trees where the nodes already exist because we've
finally agreed on a binding...

So unfortunately there is no easy way to mix DT with non-DT. So we can
decide to just merge code that's not supported on DT platforms, but what
good is that if the platform we want to run that code on supports only
DT?
