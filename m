Thanks a lot for getting this rolling!

I guess you mean "dma-ranges" here, not "ranges", right?
I don't see how "ranges" is even relevant for this.

Don't you need arguments to the phandle? It seems that in most
cases, you need at least one of a dma-ranges like translation
or a master ID. What you need would be specific to the slave.

It may be best to make the ranges explicit here and then also
allow additional fields depending on e.g. a #dma-slave-cells
property in the slave.

For instance, a 32-bit master on a a 64-bit bus that has master-id
23 would look like

	otherbus: axi@somewhere{
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
	};

	somemaster@somewhere {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		slaves = <&otherbus  // phandle
				0     // local address
				0 0   // remote address
				0x1 0 // size
				23>;  // master id
	};

How about being slightly more specific, using "dma-slaves" and
"dma-slave-names" etc?

I would prefer not having to have subnodes for the simple case
where you just need to reference one slave iommu from a master
device.

It could be a recommendation for devices that have multiple slaves,
but I still haven't seen an example where this is actually needed.

I wouldn't be worried about cycles. We can just declare them forbidden
in the binding. Anything can break if you supply a broken DT, this
is the least of the problems.
