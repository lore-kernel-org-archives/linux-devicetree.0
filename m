Yes, sounds fine. I was thinking that we grab the reference to the node 
in of_clk_add_provider() so dropping it here was to undo that, but that 
isn't true. It probably can be dropped after we register the provider 
because adding the provider will keep it pinned, but this way is more 
symmetric so it's fine.

Either way, the error path on probe doesn't call of_node_put(), so 
that's a leak.
