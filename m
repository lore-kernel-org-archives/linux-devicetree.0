Ok, that is fine. Everything he says there is ok, but it's easy to
miss the point that he is only talking about general-purpose servers
there.

It's the server people that see themselves as something different
though. Which is funny because they came up with the idea to use
ACPI in order to improve interoperability between hardware vendors,
and now that they actually want to come out with systems, everything
can already be interoperable, except that ACPI support is getting
in the way.

I don't think they are in a position to make that a requirement
for servers in general. There is a boot architecture document that
requires the use of ACPI for compliant systems. That doesn't prevent
anyone from shipping a noncompliant system. I think it's similar to
the SBSA specification: It's nice for companies to build a system
compliant with that in theory, because then they get support for
any OS that supports compliant systems, but in practice, I expect
most of them to treat the spec as more of a suggestion and take
shortcuts wherever it suits them.

I'm very strongly supporting the idea that we should not have two
different kinds of device abstractions for a given SoC family. I also
think we have two very distinct groups of SoC vendors here:

* One side actively wants to use APCI, as they want to support MS Windows,
  and they have fast and simple general-purpose SoCs designed around
  the ACPI concepts and SBSA compliance. They wouldn't ship an open
  system anyway, and when they can show a reasonable implementation
  of ACPI that works on their systems, we will very likely merge that.

* The other side has existing special-purpose SoC designs with ARM32,
  PowerPC, MIPS or other CPU cores and they want to migrate to ARM64
  because everyone else is doing that too. They ship whatever their
  customers want, but they care little about Windows support, or strict
  standards compliance as long as their customers are happy. There is
  a lot of opposition to ACPI both in the customer base and the upstream
  Linux community for these machines, so these are likely to stay with
  DT for the foreseeable future. In fact, fear over fragmentation with
  ACPI on these systems one of the issues currently holding up merging
  ACPI for the first category.
