IMHO that would be quite a "soft" dependency: it's just about adding symbols
or not. No real dependency on Linux or kernel features.

Removing unwanted symbols is indeed easier than adding them to an
existing DTB.

That's not a fair comparison: DTB symbols are not debug information,
but an ABI. It's more akin to exporting kernel symbols to (possible
out-of-tree) kernel modules, which is controlled by CONFIG_MODULES.

So a Kconfig symbol to enable it, and a dtc_strip for removing them,
makes most sense to me.

BTW, we do run strip on vmlinux ;-)
