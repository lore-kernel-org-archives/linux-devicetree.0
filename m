Bjorn has reviewed the quirk patch and wanted to check the device ID and 
vendor ID to avoid applying the quirck when bridge is non TI and same 
device ID.

So support for two PCI port requires only the PCI device id related 
change. So I will modify the subject and commit log to reflect the same 
and re-send the patch.

Thanks again Arnd for your comments.
