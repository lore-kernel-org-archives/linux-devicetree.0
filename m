Yes indeed, thanks for pointing it out.=0A=
=0A=
For the sake of current patch, please clarify whether a v2 is needed.=0A=
IIUC:=0A=
-sec_mon node name could stay the same (existing binding)=0A=
-label names are ok, since underline is the only option allowed by DTC=0A=
-alias names are out-of-spec but accepted by DTC; if changing underline=0A=
to hyphen is requested, I will push out v2=0A=
