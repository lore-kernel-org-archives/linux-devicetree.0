Wait, everyone in the world knows where we (Linux kernel developers)
are, and how to contact us, how are we supposed to know we are supposed
to go after these various companies and contact them directly?

So this SoC vendor doesn't want to merge their code upstream, fine, we
(kernel community) don't really care, and it's obvious the company
doesn't care, so what really is the issue here?

Eventually, the SoC will realize that they do need to get their code
merged, and we will still be here, as we aren't going anywhere.  At that
point in time, we will be glad to review patches and code like we do
every day for all of the thousands of other companies we deal with on a
weekly basis.

I don't see the problem here, do you?
