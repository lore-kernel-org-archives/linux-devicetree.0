Yes, for DT point of view, but every clock nodes has a rate. Variable or 
fixed.

But, if we go that way the DT clock node will become more and more 
complex with less and less chance to use some common function like 
set_rate or clk_enable.
If the notion of clock blob is needed we should maybe consider another 
binding like clock-group and let the clock node be a single source of clock.

Yeah, maybe you're right, but the goal of the common clock fmwk was to 
avoid duplication everywhere. If everybody start implementing its own 
definition of the clock nodes here and there, I'm not sure that common 
clock fmwk will be that useful compared to what we have today.

For sure we should allow some custom clock implementation, but that 
should be the exception.

I don't think anybody is necessarily complaining about potential code 
change.

The goal, however, is a pretty good question. I'm not sure it is well 
defined or at least the same for everybody.

One of the main incentive for OMAP at least was to get rid of the huge 
static files inside arch/arm/mach-omap2 used so far to define the clock 
nodes.
The issue is that an OMAP4 clock file contains ~250 clock nodes in a ~4k 
lines file.
Moving that into a DT file will for sure reduce the size of the 
arch/arm/ that was one of the complain of Linus but at the price of 
creating an even bigger DT file.

One potential need for DT will be to get rid of the static device -> 
clock mapping table we have at the end of the clock definition file.

   CLK("usbhs-omap.0", "usbtll_ick", &usb_tll_hs_ick, CK_443X),
   CLK("usbhs-omap.0", "fck", &usb_tll_hs_fck, CK_443X),

This is even mandatory considering that the device name currently used 
will not exist anymore with DT devices.

That means, that at least every leaf clocks used by drivers have to be 
exposed in DT.

Should we then expose as well the whole clock tree?

We clearly should exposed the ones that are configurable at board level, 
like the main oscillator for example or the ones that are generated by 
an Audio codec.

But then, like Sascha was saying IIRC, having a mixed of DT and static 
data might be a total mess at the end, so we might end up defining 
everything in the DT file.

Benoit
