That's my point. I'm not a LISP programmer.
Personally I think it makes readability worse.

I know that.

They should use GPIO lookup tables.

We don't encourage people to use platform data anymore.

We have unified device properties for something like "timeout-us", we
have look up tables when you need specifics like pwm, gpio, pinctrl,
...

Abusing platform data with pointers is also not welcome.

It's dead de facto.

When last time did you compile kernel for it? What was the version of kernel?
Did it get successfully?

When are we going to remove avr32 support from kernel completely?

There are more places including data structures assignments.

Exactly. You overlooked due to enormous LOC in the one change. See my
point below.

That long arithmetic with some data.

I dunno, I'm asking you. Usually if I see a pattern I got a clue to
check lib/ and similar places. From time to time I discover something
new and interesting there.

Yes, because my point is *split* this to be reviewable.
