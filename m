Please include bcm4708.dtsi instead here.

I assume this is a bcm4709 SoC, then you should used this line:
compatible = "brcm,bcm94709", "brcm,bcm4709", "brcm,bcm4708";

If you would put these device tree files into the bootloader and we
would have to do an workaround for all bcm4709 SoC, but nor for the
bcm4708 Soc Linux would be able to detect this.

What is the difference between bcm53012 and bcm4708?

Currently we have the bcm4708.dtsi and the bcm47081.dtsi file one is for
dual core SoCs and the other for the single core versions, does one of
them fit BCM953012K, then you should include it?

I assume this is a bcm53012 SoC and a BCM953012K board, then you should
used this line:
compatible = "brcm,bcm953012k", "brcm,brcm53012", "brcm,bcm4708";
