Yes, why would anyone want to use single if sg is available?

Can you explain what these are, how they are used by clients?

Okay, why would anyone want transactions at fixed interval. We are talking
about DMA, so please give me transfers without delay or whenever bus is
available!

And why would they want that?

So max burst lengths then, why would anyone configure lesser?

Looking at above I think we do not warrant programming them. Assume defaults
in your driver for performance. Like max burst lengths, Max transactions,
without delay scheduling.

If you disagree, which is fine, please provide the cases where a client
would need to program these to different values.

Well that is precisely a  problem. The generic applications wont know "your"
custom API and will not configure that!
