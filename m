Hi Lee,

I'd like to combine elements of your V3 and this series (V4?). Firstly
let's stay away from modifying the semantics around CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED.
There was discussion around adding a new flag which I'd like to avoid if
possible.

If we're leaving clocks enabled then it would be best to reflect that
reality with the prepare/enable refcounting in the core. The best way to
do this is with clk_prepare_enable(my_alwon_clk). Drivers already do
this today by hacking calls to clk_prepare_enable into their driver's
probe function, and we can support it more explicitly in DT.

Since we already have assigned-clock-rate and assigned-clock-parent in
drivers/clk/clk-conf.c I propose that we add a third property here,
assigned-clock-alwon. I don't really care about the name, so feel free
to change it, so long as your suggestion is Measurably Better.

This property can only be added to clock providers (not consumers),
because if we have a clock consumer then that consumer should just call
clk_prepare_enable. See the pseudo-code below:

Amazing, I know. Is there any aspect of this approach which does not
solve your use case?

We should mark this new property (assigned-clk-alwon) as unstable since
it can (and likely will) grow into more stuff in the future (e.g.
Stephen Boyd mentioned a "hand-off" which tells the core to keep clocks
enabled until the correct driver claims them).

Mike
