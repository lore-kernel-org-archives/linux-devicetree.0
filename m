Simply using DT would help avoiding the awkward situation where a driver
of a device only works with one of the two description formats and not
the other.

They can ship with ACPI if they want to, what is important is that they
ship with device tree too.
Encouraging them to do that is definitely the right thing to do today,
regardless of the medium to long term ACPI strategy for the Linux
kernel.

Well said.
