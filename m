While using the pci-host-generic driver to add PCI support for the
Cavium ThunderX processors, several bugs were discovered.  This patch
set fixes the bugs, a follow-on set will add the ThunderX support.

Changes from v1:

  - "PCI: generic: Allow bus default MSI controller to be specified."
    patch was dropped as it is no longer necessary.

  - "PCI: Make global and export pdev_fixup_irq()." and "PCI: generic:
    Only fixup irqs for bus we are creating." were rewritten to move
    the support into a somewhat more generic form in setup-irq.c.

  - Add some clarifying text to host-generic-pci.txt

  - Add some Acked-by:

David Daney (5):
  PCI: Add pci_bus_fixup_irqs().
  PCI: generic: Only fixup irqs for bus we are creating.
  PCI: generic: Quit clobbering our pci_ops.
  PCI: generic: Correct, and avoid overflow, in bus_max calculation.
  PCI: generic: Pass proper starting bus number to pci_scan_root_bus().
