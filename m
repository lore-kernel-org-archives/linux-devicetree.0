A33 Q8 tablets with the ippo-q8h-v1.2 pcb will work fine with the
generic q8-tablet.dts and given the many variants of PCBs found in
Q8 tablets using such a specific dts name was a mistake in hindsight.

We cannot just drop the ippo-q8h-v1.2.dtb as existing u-boot configs
may very well point to it.

The plan is to remove the matching u-boot config after v2015.10 (which will
ship with a generic q8_a33_tablet_defconfig file), and then once the
next u-boot has shipped for a bit we can consider removing the symlink
and Makefile entry for this.
