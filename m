This is all that this pair of registers provide.

The SoC has other clocks handled by other DT nodes - for Dove, we now
have:

        gate_clk: clock-gating-ctrl@0038 {
                compatible = "marvell,dove-gating-clock";
                reg = <0x0038 0x4>;
                clocks = <&core_clk 0>;
                #clock-cells = <1>;
        };
        divider_clk: core-clock@0064 {
                compatible = "marvell,dove-divider-clock";
                reg = <0x0064 0x8>;
                #clock-cells = <1>;
        };
        core_clk: core-clocks@0214 {
                compatible = "marvell,dove-core-clock";
                reg = <0x0214 0x4>;
                #clock-cells = <1>;
        };

and all three of these are part of the PMU register block.  I'm not sure
why the mvebu maintainers decided to minutely describe the PMU like this,
but unfortunately that's the structure we have.

What's more silly is that the "dove-core-clock" appears to disagree in
terminology with the manual - there's a "Core PLL" which supplies the
dividers in the "divider_clk" block, and is entirely separate from the
CPU PLL which "core_clk" is describing.

IMHO, it would've been cleaner to have these components registered
separately from a central PMU driver (as I'm doing with the power
domains, resets and IRQs that are part of the PMU), but my view is
limited to Dove and not the other mvebu clocks, so there may be a good
reason for it.
