Actually, the only one missing something here is myself, as I do not 
quite have the full picture :-)
Mine was a bit of a "reverse allocation" -- we know we must end up at 
0xf4000000. Since all the addresses are shifted by 0xf1000000, here 
comes 0x03000000... But please see my last question further down.

I believe that makes a lot more sense this way... I guess this feature 
(device bus) requires your latest set of patches, right? (either v7 as 
you posted yesterday or your tree at 
git://github.com/MISL-EBU-System-SW/mainline-public.git/marvell-mvebu-mbus-v7)

I sort of had the impression I could do already do that somehow, though 
I am not quite sure anymore...

So, in the end, you think it's OK to have a set of nodes with "relative" 
addresses (gpio@10140, serial@12000 etc...) and some with "absolute" 
addresses (nand@0xf4000000, where the ranges property does a 0-offset 
translation)?
Even though I understand this is just some transitional state, and it 
will all be fixed like your example above, once we get the rest of the 
rework merged (mbus/devbus).

Thanks a lot for your patience!
