Ooh, this is exactly what I wanted for of_iommu_xlate(), and would be 
much nicer than the current bodge using system_state that I ended up 
with. The context there is very similar - if the device has a parent 
IOMMU then we want to wait for that to probe first if possible, but with 
a deadline such that if it doesn't show up then we can go ahead and make 
progress without it (on the assumption that DMA ops can fall back to 
CMA). The modules problem doesn't currently apply to IOMMU drivers 
either, although we do use a special of_device_id table for detecting 
built-in drivers via OF_IOMMU_DECLARE() to avoid deferring at all when 
we know it would be pointless - a more generic solution for that could 
certainly be useful too.

I agree with Greg that the naming here is a bit tricky - FWIW my initial 
thought would be something like driver_defer_until_init(), which is 
still clunky but at least imperative.
