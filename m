for now I've implemented something less hacky: I made the reset
optional and only specified it for phy0.
During Jerome's tests the reset was not needed, while on my board it's
required to bring both PHYs up.
Additionally the USB PHY reference driver does not have any reset
logic for newer SoCs (GXL), so making the reset optional doesn't sound
that bad to me.
