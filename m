Ok, fair enough.

Ok, thanks.

Right. Most clock controllers tend to be initialized at early boot
time, but some of them are on external PMICs that are only probed after
i2c or some other subsystem is up.

Ok, looks good.

Hmm, that file seems to do two things that ehci-platform doesn't:
It handles big-endian controllers and it has special initialization
for compatible="ibm,usb-ehci-440epx". It also uses a different way
to get to the resources because the driver dates back to before the
unification of platform_bus and of_platform_bus, but that can be
trivially changed.

I would hope that we can eventually merge the two drivers, and I'm
guessing that we will sooner or later need the big-endian support on
non-ppc machines anyway. The question is what to do about the 440epx
hack. It may be small enough that we can just leave it as a quirk
inside #ifdef CONFIG_PPC in the unified driver, or it may end up
being shared with arm64 X-Gene, which seems to share a common
ancestry with some of the ppc4xx socs.
