Really? Actually this should be more like pine64-pine64.dts, but since
the company name is identical to their (first?) product, I found it
rather weird to have this double naming.
The ARM DTs for instance are also just "juno.dts" and "juno-r1.dts".

Good point, will fix it!

Repeated rationale for the below comments.
