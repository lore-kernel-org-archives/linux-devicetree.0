There may be future changes necessary which may be done by people who do
not know which hardware this. For them it will be convenient to be able
to search for the hardware and maybe even find a schematics. Anyway, it
will just help to have that information around.

Yes, they can, but that still doesn't make these node references necessary.
If I read this it seems to me that you explicitly want to disable these
nodes. A reader can't know you add them for convenience here.

Then you should bind the pwm-beeper driver to it, not a backlight.
