It came up a while ago on Freescale community, but I think that user
used downstream BSP's:
https://community.freescale.com/thread/332326

The Colibri VF61 board overwrites the latency, so it is not really
critical for this board.

The Freescale Tower runs at 400MHz by default, but has a CPU which would
support up to 500MHz. I am pretty sure with 500MHz CPU clock, things
will go south with current settings.

Regarding stable: Would probably be consistent...
