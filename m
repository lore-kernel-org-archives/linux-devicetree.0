Well, given that in your case, the IOMMU never sees the MSI write, it
definitely falls into the "not translated" category.

As for handling it on top of Eric's series, that's probably the most
reasonable thing to do, which also means that none of this should appear
in the ITS driver. Robin seems to have an idea on how to approach this.
