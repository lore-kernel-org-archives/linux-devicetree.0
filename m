Some of your comments have been addressed as changes and some as replies.

Yeah it would have been great to have some ack. It has been many
months now, but I see its not uncommon for bindings go in via
maintainers. I assume folks find it just normal.

I will reply in yet another way.... the spec I have don't mention that
(and it makes sense) and your platform doesn't do that either. I would
have had to do something about it, had there been such a weird setup,
but there's none known.

 So let us please avoid getting into bikeshedding discussion yet
again. Otherwise almost every binding is broken because there could
always be some platform that does weird things with irqs.

In your last post you said:
  "Sorry my statement was not clear, I wanted to ask you to add that info
to the binding."
  Not that it makes sense to say the obvious, I added it just to
address your comment.

Abort should have happened years ago if someone _tries_ to access a
secure resource from non-secure mode ;)
How do you protect such people from "trying to" dereference NULL
pointers?  (you made me repeat Nth time).

I did not miss your last mail. Let me try to reply in even simpler
terms... PID[0,3] identification is fine grained enough. If/when we
have some platform with non-ARM MHU, we could catch that in this
driver. Most likely even then the reg-map won't change drastically, if
at all. So we could ignore the PID4, otherwise we check PID4 in this
driver and adapt the behavior.
