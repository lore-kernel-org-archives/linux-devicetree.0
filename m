IEEE1275 (Open Firmware) specification has details on it in the MMU
(section 3.6.5), Memory (section 3.7.6) node specifications and the
glossary defines how the property should look. How you find that
document is.. up to you (I have a PDF of it I got hold of around 2004,
it used to be linked at www.openfirmware.org but I've not checked). I
think it's missed from the devicetree.org spec since it's already very
well defined and there's no reason to reinvent (or redefine) the
wheel.

Essentially it follows the same format as "reg" - phys.hi phys.lo
length - which define regions which are ACTUALLY available to the
system. The intent is that it would be used to define the memory as
going from an address for a certain size, but mark sections of it the
device tree user could use (further intent being that you would want
the OS to know that there is, for example, 4GiB of memory there and
set up any mappings to suit, but the last 256MiB is where you've put
some important data and you would rather it didn't just allocate it to
something else..).

Linux doesn't actually parse and use the information in the available
property (or care about "existing" property in an MMU node since it
replaces page tables super early and has different ideas about mapping
than most bootloaders), but other operating systems possibly do. It
would not be a significant hardship for Linux to actually parse the
property if present and use that information after a bit of sanity
checking rather than just trusting reg. And in that sense, it would
not be a significant hardship to use existing specifications to define
nodes that describe memory, since if there IS parsing code available,
it will be re-used, which is good all round.
