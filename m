Do you mean implemented in user space or the driver? Obviously the
latter is against the API specification, since VIDIOC_STREAMOFF is
expected to instantly stop any pending hardware operations and
gracefully discard any queued buffers or processing results.

I've talked with Alex and he should be able to convert our internal
document and post it as the initial draft RFC. Help with review will
be definitely appreciated, thanks!

Note that we shouldn't repeat the same mistake as with stateful codecs
and allow merging drivers without the API being specified. That led to
drivers doing this their own ways and having to account for those
quirks in the stateful codec API specification we're working on right
now.

Best regards,
Tomasz
