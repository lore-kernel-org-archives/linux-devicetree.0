Except that SPMI supports bus configurations with multiple masters.
Unless by 'bus' you meant 'bus controller' here?

The SPMI spec says nothing about partitioning up the slave address to
support multiple functions.  AFAICT, this is a Qualcomm-created
construct (QPNP) for the 8x41 PMICs.  It's difficult to tell at this
point whether or not other vendors might implement a similarly
partitioned scheme.

I suspect the intent is that implementations make use of logical slave
ID for each function in a multi-function device.

It is certainly possible, and, as you've seen, is how the current
codeaurora.org tree implements SPMI.  But, I'm actually actively trying
to avoid doing so, as it conflates Qualcomm-implementation details and
what is actually in the spec (and not just the address space
partitioning, but also the of_spmi.c[2] parsing must know about
interrupts, which are _also_ completely outside the SPMI spec).

Instead what I hope to do for v3 is either:
  A) Make QPNP its own bus type (for which I have a prototyped
     implementation).  A PMIC driver sits on the SPMI bus and registers
     itself as a QPNP controller.  QPNP controllers have very
     simple 8-bit register read/write operations used by QPNP devices.
  B) Effectively the same as A, but gets rid of a special QPNP bus type
     and uses mfd/platform devices, similar to other in-tree PMIC drivers
     (currently working on prototyping this approach)

Great! Thanks for testing.
