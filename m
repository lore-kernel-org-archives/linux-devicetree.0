Both actually, I think. If a power supply input for a device has 2 
supplies connected then list both of them for that device rather than 
create a virtual device in DT. Of course, you could keep a virtual 
regulator independent of DT. That is more of an implementation choice.

None of this has anything to do with the binding other than you can 
write a regulator driver and already have the mechanism to instantiate 
it with DT.

Either you could keep the driver and the consumer driver is responsible 
for instantiating the regulator. It could also be implemented as a helper 
library in the regulator core.

That's a good point. Perhaps the regulator core needs to be able to 
parse the list and return the single ptr to the virtual regulator.

Support of out of tree things has never been a winning argument for 
upstream.

With an out of tree binding as well?

I think this case is somewhat different. What I'm suggesting is closer 
to the hardware which is what Mark also argued for, but we should let 
him speak. If the input supply name on a device is VCC and you have REG1 
and REG2 attached, then having "vcc-supply = <&REG1>, <&REG2>;" makes 
perfect sense in terms of matching the h/w.

Also, simplefb is not a good thing to compare with.
