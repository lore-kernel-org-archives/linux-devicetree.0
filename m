A Kconfig sounds fine to me. Altogether, I don't think it's that bad
because only these boards are known to have broken because of this
series:

at91-sama5d3_xplained
sama5d35ek

ste-snowball

vexpress-v2p-ca15
vexpress-v2p-ca15
vexpress-v2p-ca15_a7
vexpress-v2p-ca15-tc1
vexpress-v2p-ca9

I assume there's only 3 different bugs to fix there, plus a race in
imx boards that I have only papered over with a delay so far.

The failure rate seems to be so high because each boot is a
combination of board+defconfig and there are duplicated boards in
several labs and many were just offline at that moment.

But I agree that there's no way I can test it on all supported hw, so
a Kconfig that people can quickly switch on to disable the feature
sounds good to me.

The gpio-ranges fix for Tegra has a commit that safeguards backwards
compatibility, and the typo in regulator names for ux500 doesn't
really break anything that I can see, I just stumped into it when
trying to blindly fix the boot for ste-snowball (I don't have access
to that hw).

Now I realize what you meant, that makes sense to me.
