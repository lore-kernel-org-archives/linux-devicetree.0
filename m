In x86 there could be two ranges, one for softiotlb under 4G and another
for range over 4G, but kexec_crash_size only shows the size of
over-4g-range.

It is better to use /proc/iomem, most arches use /proc/iomem. Do you
have any reason why it will be obsolete? At least for the time being it
is fine.
