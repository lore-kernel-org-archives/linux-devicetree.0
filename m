OK then mention it as the firmware. Don't tell anything about what the
driver assumes, that's Linux/driver specific.

It does.

What if there's a platform with broken irq, it just can skip that in DT
if we use named interrupts in the binding.

Sorry my statement was not clear, I wanted to ask you to add that info
to the binding.

Exactly, it can and you have already handled it in the probe, and it
must be that way. Else you are confusing the state machine in the
mailbox core and working it around in your driver, which is wrong.

Agreed, and that's how it's done. But I was thinking of cases where
there are multiple clients transferring small data.

Here you are assuming the fact about HZ value in the driver. Leave that
to timer subsystem for the conversion(msecs_to_jiffies takes care of
rounding) and put values based on what hardware expects IMO.

No that's wrong IMO. You mask is incorrect as it doesn't include PID4
which in this case contains
[3:0] DES_2 JEP106 continuation code that identifies the designer.
Set to 0x4 for ARM.

IMO it's not a proper comparison/match as you are not including part of
ID that identifies the designer.
