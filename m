Like I said above we can tell if the hardware was reset because
mark_dirty() is called.

Well, remember that it's very expensive to remove a value from the cache
so actively trying to prune the cache would be bad.

That'd happen on first read, yes.

Could you articulate what changes you believe would be seen?

I'm not suggesting that we do anything based on the presence of a cache
entry, I'm suggesting that we could avoid having to ever cache values
that never get referenced on a system (which can be a lot of them for
common use cases) saving us memory.  Maintaining a dirty bitmask would
work too, but it does push the memory consumption up further which might
be a concern.
