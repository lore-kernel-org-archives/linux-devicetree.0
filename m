I have some doubts here, i.e. the order in which clocks are being 
configured may be important in some cases. Should the binding then be
specifying that the clocks will be configured in a sequence exactly 
as listed in the clock-parents property ?

E.g. consider part of a clock controller where one of frequencies fed to
a consumer device cannot exceed given value:

                mux1
 200 MHz   0 .--------.
----->-------|--.     |
             |   \____|__                    f1 
 400 MHz   1 |        |  `-+------------------->--
----->-------|-       |    |
             '--------'	   |	  mux2
                           | 0 .---------.
                           `---|--.      |   f2
                               |   \_____|_,---->--
                 100 MHz     1 |         |   (max. 200 MHz)
                 ----->--------|         | 
                               '---------'		

In this case we want to set frequency f1 to 400 MHz and f2 to 100 MHz.
To ensure f2 doesn't exceed 200 MHz at any time, mux2 has to be switched 
to position '1' first and then mux 1 to position '1'.

> +        clock-rates = <460800>;

For clock-rates it's a bit more complicated, since it might require
setting up frequency of some clocks twice - first to a low and then 
to a higher value. Such details could likely be handled by bindings 
of individual devices. Also we could assume the clock tree 
(re)configuration is being done when any consumer clocks are masked 
at the consumer clock gates.

I'm no sure if we should sort the clocks to ensure any parents are set
before the child clocks, or should we rely on the sequence specified 
in devicetree ? I'd assume sorting it wouldn't hurt, there should not 
be relatively many clocks in a single dt node.
