I thought when we had discussed the subsystem specific bindings, the
consensus there was to have subsystem specific accessors and
properties/tables.

I would argue that for everything that ACPI already has (interrupts,
registers, gpio, dmaengine, ...) the native method should be used,
possibly using _DSD to provide naming for otherwise anonymous references.
