That'd probably be best.

As far as stable goes, I can't convince myself that it is really stable
kernel material.  I'm not aware what happened to the eth* renumber patch,
was that applied to stable trees?  My view would be that the lan*
renumbering should be applied to the same trees which include the eth*
renumbering and no further, iff the eth* renumber was even backported.

Talking to Jon Nettleton @ SR, he's in favour of it being applied to
stable kernels.
