In fact it was the other way round. We modeled the IPU devicetree
binding after the hardware and bended the driver around it. The DRM
single-card model is the limiting fator here, not the devicetree.

Indeed. The drm_encoder_slave stuff depends on the I2C bus driver being
compiled into the kernel. Once the I2C bus driver is modular and the DRM
driver is not it won't work anymore. The drm_encoder_slave only works
properly for PCI/AGP cards which have their own I2C bus master on the
card (which is implemented by the same monolithic DRM driver).

The problem probably was that most people (including me) were simply not
aware of the idea to have class specific platform data.
