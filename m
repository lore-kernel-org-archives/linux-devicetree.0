Can you elaborate with an example of why not? Why can't the overlay
happen at a later stage in the kernel boot as Tony suggests?

One thought would be that ideally devices that are dependent on a
particular board variant would be disabled in the base DT blob until you
know what board you are. However, that assumes that they can be
initialised at a later stage in the boot process and may be for some
regulators or other devices this is not possible. I know you mentioned
some time restrictions for some devices, but I still don't see why it
could not happen later.
