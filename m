The issue with the adau1977 is slightly different, there is only one single 
register which is not affected, so we need special handling for that 
register. For all other registers the default behavior of regcache_sync() is 
correct.

I think a better approach is to introduce a new flag internally, similar to 
the cache_dirty flag. Set both this new flag and cache_dirty when 
regcache_mark_dirty() is called. But only cache_dirty when a write is 
performed when the regmap is marked as cache only. Now in regcache_sync() 
and friends check this new flag and only when it is set skip registers which 
match the default. At the end of regcache_sync() clear both flags.

Probably factor the check whether wee need to sync or not into a helper 
function, that can be used here and below in sync_block_raw().
