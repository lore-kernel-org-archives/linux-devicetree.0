Xen does not disable the clock(s). The problem is Linux thinks the clock 
is not used and therefore will disable the clock.

Actually Xen does not have any knowledge how to handle clocks (i.e 
setting rate, enabling/disabling). I would recommend you to read the 
binding description in the patch and not the implementation which is 
IHMO misleading.

Xen is removing the node from the DT. Not removing the node will not 
change the problem. Linux is disabling the clock because there is no 
driver which used those clocks.

As the clock subsystem will disable any unused clocks (from Linux point 
of view), the UART will get disabled and the console will be lost.

What we want to achieve with this patch is to let Linux knows that this 
clock is in use by someone else (hypervisor or guest) and:
     * If the clock is not shared: don't disable it
     * If the clock is shared: don't change the rate

I don't have any knowledge on the Renesas SH/R-Mobile. However, we 
expect some cooperation between DOM0 and Xen to handle the power.

For instance managing the clocks in Xen would require to implement clock 
driver for each SOC because it does not seem to have a generic way to do it.

Given that Linux already knows a lot about the clock, we want to hand 
over the clock control to the hardware domain (i.e dom0). This means 
that we have to find a way to cooperate with it to keep enable clocks 
that we care about.
