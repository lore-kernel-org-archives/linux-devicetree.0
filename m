Since everybody copied my own mistake from the DT binding example,
let's address all the offenders in one swift go.

Most of them got the CPU interface size wrong (4kB, while it should
be 8kB), except for both keystone platforms which got the control
interface wrong (4kB instead of 8kB).

In the couple of cases were I knew for sure what implementation
was used, I've added the "arm,gic-400" compatible string. I'm 99%
sure that this is what everyong is using, but short of having the
TRM for all the other SoCs, I've let them alone.
