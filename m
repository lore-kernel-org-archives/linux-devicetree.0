The main advantage I see is that you explicitly don't need any platform-
specific functions to do the switching; you end up with platform-agnostic
code (the I2C GPIO mux driver) and platform-specific configuration for
that driver (the GPIO ID to use). The display driver just talks to the
I2C API for the DDC I2C bus, and doesn't do anything to switch between
the busses; the I2C GPIO mux driver does all that internally. Thus, the
display driver will work fine on boards that don't need this muxing with
zero changes; the board simply wouldn't register the mux driver.

Well, the EDID needs to be read on every hotplug event, so it's certainly
not a one-time thing.

Other I2C users/devices also shouldn't be impacted by the mux; they
would continue to use the existing I2C APIs for the bus their devices
are attached to, and not know about the mux. The overhead should be
almost zero; the I2C GPIO mux driver could remember the previous bus
selection and only modify it (gpio_set_value) when switching between
busses. I guess there might be a small overhead to taking a lock to
protect the bus selection; I'm not sure whether the I2C core serializes
access already or you'd need to add this; check the existing I2C I2C
bus mux implementation I guess.
