No, either you have 1 interrupt and it is the combined one. or you have
the 9? separate interrupts.  Having both combined and separate hooked up
is a bit dumb, so I would not worry about that case. I would just define
the event counter interrupt 1st as that is probably the primary use.
Also, I think that was the only interrupt on the L2x0 controllers IIRC.

It's also conceivable that some of the interrupts get routed somewhere
else rather than just into the GIC.
