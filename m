Hi Vineet,

Yeh, for me it prevents the following build lines appearing every time:
DTC     arch/metag/boot/dts/tz1090_01sp.dtb

but it still does these every time:
DTB    arch/metag/boot/dts/tz1090_01sp.dtb.S
AS      arch/metag/boot/dts/tz1090_01sp.dtb.o

Adding dtbs o targets actually didn't seem to be necessary with $(dtb-y)
added.

Cheers
James
