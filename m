Well, as far as I'm concerned right now, it's for Mark to sort out this
situation, and tell us what he wants to do with the Kirkwood stuff.  I
suspect he's keeping quiet because he doesn't care about it.

Given that he's the one with the knowledge of DPCM, and he's the maintainer
of ASoC, he has the ultimate responsibility for sorting out this and
giving direction as to how he wants to proceed.

As I understand it though, my solution is the full and proper DPCM solution,
and I believe that what's currently in mainline is not a DPCM solution.

Mark needs to correct that, because he is one of the few who knows this
stuff.
