These are already specified in imx6qdl.dtsi.

I think the naming schema below matches DT convention better, i.e. the
node name should be generic.

Drop this new line and have 'status' be the last property.

I'm not sure why this and a 'reg' property in sub-nodes are necessary at
all, but ...

... at least the 'reg' property should match the unit-address after node
name.
