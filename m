Now using it in most cases, except for two or three functions that would need to have a handle
passed to it solely for the purpose of using dev_*.

> This all looks like a very simple demux of a single register - don't we have a generic irqchip
that can handle it?  It looks like that's what you're trying to implement here, each DMA channel
could be requesting the three interrupts it has separately rather than open coding an interrupt
controller here.

do it if we used a regmap, though it assumes threading and isn't a great fit).

I will look into this.  If one fits perfectly, great. If not, then I will add one.
