No, that's not the functionality you want.  You want for the clock not
to be RE-gated (big difference).  Currently, the STFE clock will never
be gated, even when a) it's not used and b) can actually be disabled.
You're needlessly wasting power here.

Also, in your use-case there is a visible user, and the prepare/enable
counts will be correct.

Using existing sub-system supplied mechanisms in the way they were not
intended is sub-optimal (read "hacky").

That would also be fine(ish).  The issue is that this problem is
board specific, so the platform clock driver would have to contain
board level knowledge.  Also, if you were to implement this, it would
too mess up reference counting in the core.

In this instance, since the STFE clock is only used by this IP, I
would choose to handle it in the driver.  This can be done using a
single flag stored in pdata which should be fetched using
of_match_device().  This way there is no need for any more API abuse;
either by incorrectly identifying the STFE clock as critical OR
invoking any internal __clk_*() calls.

Enable the clock once in .probe(), which you already do.

Then, whenever you do any power saving do:

suspend()
{
	if (!ddata->enable_clk_once)
		clk_disable(clk);
}

resume()
{
	if (!ddata->enable_clk_once)
		clk_enable(clk);
}

However, looking at your driver, I think this point might even be
moot, since you don't have any power saving.  The only time you
disable the clock is in the error path.  Just replace that with a
comment about the platform's unfortunate errata.

I'm glad you mentioned this.  Let's take a look:

Not the case here.

This clock *can* be gated and can be turned off *sometimes*.

This clock *does* have a driver and correct references *can* be
taken.

[...]

All I'm saying is, and it's the same thing I've said many times; these
types of issues do not exhibit the same set of symptoms as a critical
clock by definition.  Critical clocks are those which references can
not be taken by any other means.  Think of the critical clock
framework as a mechanism to circumvent the requirement of writing a
special driver which would *only* handle clocks i.e. an interconnect
driver in the ST case.
