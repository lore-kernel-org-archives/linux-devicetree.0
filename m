Well, if we follow that policy, we would have to remove almost anything
from the -colibri.dtsi device trees...

The Colibri standard defines standard functionality, which is kept
compatible across modules with different SoC's. However, on almost all
pins different functionality is available, and we have some customer
which make use that....

So far we followed the policy that we define the pin/device
configuration of the standard functionality in the -colibri.dtsi files
(since this is the most used functionality). This allows us to also
"bug-fix" standard functionality without having to touch customers
(often out-of-tree) device trees.

This change is not different from that approach, it merely splits the
pin configuration in two individual pinctrl nodes. This makes sense for
PWM signals since they can be used individually (compared to, lets say,
I2C, where it is more like "all or nothing")...  It turned out that
several customers used PWM<A> for the display back light, while using
PWM<C> in a different function, therefor that change.
