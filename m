Good idea.
If you have any patch, I will be very happy to verify.

How about adding these things in drivers/phy/phy-core.c, it is also 
sharable, though not in usb core.

Just tried adding one member struct usb_otg otg to struct phy, since not 
find any good member can hold usb_otg.
In drivers/phy/phy-core.c, adding extcon_register_interest, 
phy_vbus_notifier, phy_set_peripheral, it works for me, dwc2 on hikey board.

Understand.

That's great, thanks.

Thanks for the explanation.
