Ignoring status is a bug for a static DT. There could be places that
expect the node to be present, but disabled. Those may be bugs too.

For many nodes, status simply makes no sense or at least is undefined.

I'm surprised it's that many. It's a low-level detail that the core
should handle. We'd also need to make things like of_find_node_by_name
honor status.

I'm not sure this is really something we want or need to fix.

I could just make this depend on OF_KOBJ instead. Then practically no
one would see any change as almost everyone enables sysfs (and in turn
/proc/device-tree).
