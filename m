The behavior of local controller and remote firmware clubbed together
is what mailbox drivers have to deal with.

 For example, if the remote f/w doesn't clear the STAT register after
reading it, this driver won't have a way to know if the last tx has
been done or not, i.e, mhu_last_tx_done() won't work. And that
behavior is not decided by Linux/driver, so is in a way a h/w feature.
Does your remote f/w not clear the STAT?

The MHU chapter in my SoC manual suggests the specification requires
an RX-IRQ per channel. Does your platform omit the irq?

I am aware and it is perfectly possible to not touch the secure
channel from NS mode.

I think (val == 0) is less cluttered.

Our bootloader also uses mhu so we could have failed/pending bits in
STAT when Linux first tries to use it. However since then the driver
clears the STAT register upon startup, so this could probably be
dropped. Will do.

If your usage of mailbox is so frequent that request-release of irq
proves expensive, maybe you could fix your client to hold onto the
channel for the lifetime. I don't see why your scpi_protocol.c
shouldn't do that, even if request_irq was in probe.

Hmm... this was supposed to be tested before sending out the patchset,
but probably overlooked because we have shim api for before mailbox
driver is probed. Yeah we need to drop the amba_request_regions.
Thanks.

Similar on my platform.  However 1 isn't much meaning in milliseconds
because mod_timer works in jiffiy which is usually atleast 5ms. If we
are polling we can't anyway expect latency critical stuff, so 10ms
seems like a safe bet.

How is that a problem? AMBA chooses to compare 32bits of PID for the
class. The PID4 might change across versions of MHU, which we could
figure out in the mhu driver in future.
