I think you are barking in the wrong thread here.
I deliberately sent some code to bring this discussion back to a more
technical level.

But anyway...

Actually I am trying to help that it doesn't need to stay this way. I
don't see a real reason why a distribution should support a particular
platform, they certainly don't for x86, for instance.
I think a stable DT would help to overcome this limited support that we
see here and would allow distributions to not need to care about sunxi
in particular.

There should be one good DT for all kernels - it may be updated
(especially if new features get supported), but should never break.
Also please note that the DT is not only for Linux, BSDs for instance
use it too - for instance FreeBSD on ARM64.

That there are technical ways to mitigate the problem doesn't count as
an excuse to break DT.

To make this clear: The original PLL6 clock _binding_ is actually fine:
it describes the clock as per the manual with two clock outputs.
It's just the driver that is ignoring the clock-output-names that causes
the issue.
So we can happily keep the binding, fix the driver and re-use that very
binding for PLL8, as well.
This fix series here was the easiest approach in terms of changed code.
I can make some patches that implement the proper solution - if you
promise to not shoot down 0/x again easily.

I see that good DT bindings are not easy to come up with. Yes, we are
not perfect and especially for sunxi with it's bad original
documentation we won't create perfect DTs from the beginning.
But I think we should at least _try_ to make a DT what's is meant:
describing the hardware, part of the firmware and OS agnostic - which
implies compatibility.

I think this argument has been discussed quite a bit in the
other thread.
What I am really worried about is that this now creeps into the arm64 world.
Yes, I see your point that it was a no-brainer so far, but that doesn't
mean that it has to stay this way. For the A64 for instance there are
more devices with eMMC in the pipe (Remix Mini PC and the Olimex board),
so we can just put our firmware bits and the boot loader on there and
distributions don't need to ship those.

Seriously?

I would prefer if you would save your NACKs for patches that break
something instead.

If you are concerned that this fix is too involved, that's mostly due to
the reason that I couldn't revert the original patch easily due to
conflicts in subsequent patches, so I did a bit more for the rollback.
The actual core fix is pretty easy.

So I hope we can come to a conclusion about this one before I prepare
the next set of patches.

Cheers,
Andre.
