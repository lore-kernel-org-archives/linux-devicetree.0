Your 32-bit DTS:es lack copyright headers alltogether, and this is GPLv2 only.
Given the movement to use dual GPL/X11 on DTS contents, it might be a good idea
to kick off that process with your legal team if you haven't already. Please
follow up with copyright revisions as appropriate, on both 32 and 64-bit.
