Hi,

this is v2 adressing the two comments that Marc had on the previous
version.
Changelog:
- remove bogus affinity field from GICv3 maintenance interrupt
- replace commit message for patch 2/4
----------------

The freely available ARM Foundation model [1] supports emulating a
GICv3 interrupt controller (--gicv3).
To provide the kernel with the proper information, prepare the
existing model .dts to be split up and eventually create a new .dts
file which can be used to boot a kernel using the GICv3 in the model.

Patch 1/4 changes the common device tree to allow sharing most of the
definitions later, while patch 2/4 is a drive-by-fix to add support
for the recently enabled EOImode=1.
Patch 3/4 splits the existing DT up to have a common .dtsi file and a
stub foundation-v8.dts in preparation for the final patch 4/4, which
adds a new foundation-v8-gicv3.dts that has the required GICv3 node.

Together with the GICv3 support of the bootwrapper this allows to boot
Linux and make it use the GICv3 interrupt controller.

Cheers,
Andre.
