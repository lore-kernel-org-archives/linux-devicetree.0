Thomas,

thanks for the info below. Reading a little bit through the GPL'ed
source, I also quickly came to the same conclusion. It is more likely
we can reuse some stuff from other SoCs than Orion or Armada 370/XP.

I have already moved it under mach-mv88de3xxx as for now, all SoCs
Marvell is providing as DE (Digital Entertainment) fit in that. I like
mach-codename style more than plain numbers, maybe I rename the folder
to mach-berlin before posting.

Speaking of "berlin", they found a 2WW bomb in my home town center today
and are evacuating apartments. Mine too, so it looks like I'll have
some time to prepare v2 tonight..

Ok, I'll add that info to Marvell SoC documentation also.
