That's a good rule.  But if we add a generic implementation used only
by one architecture, the overall complexity has increased (we added
new unshared code), so the next person has to look at N+1 existing
implementations.  If we even convert one existing arch, that seems
like an improvement: we have N implementations with one being used by
at least two arches.
