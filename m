that should work. Let the enabled IPU create the imx-drm platform device
on probe, parse the device tree and ignore everything only hanging off
of the disabled IPU.

That might work, too. Just let the each IPU scan the graph and try to
find the imx-drm master before creating the imx-drm platform device.
The first IPU fill find no preexisting master and create the imx-drm
platform device as above, adding the other IPU as well as the other
components with component_master_add_child. It just has to make sure
that the other IPU is added to the list before the encoders are.

The second IPU will scan the graph, find a preexisting master for the
other IPU node, register its component and just wait to be bound by the
master.

Here the second IPU would not be connected to the first IPU via the
graph - it would not find a preexisting imx-drm device when scanning its
graph and create its own imx-drm device just like the first IPU did.
As a result there are two completely separate DRM devices.

That being said, this change could be made at any time in the future,
in a backwards compatible fashion, by just declaring the imx-drm node
optional and ignoring it if it exists.

This is what is happening right now, except that the two IPUs are not
obtained from the graph but are given as starting points via the ports
property in the imx-drm node.

Did anybody propose such a generic term? How about:

-imx-drm {
-	compatible = "fsl,imx-drm";
-	ports = <&ipu1_di0>, <&ipu1_di1>;
-};
+display-subsystem {
+	compatible = "fsl,imx-display-subsystem";
+	ports = <&ipu1_di0>, <&ipu1_di1>;
+};

That is the exact same problem as having multiple drivers that can bind
to the same device.

And two graphics cards connected to the same output with a multiplexer
are a mess. This only works well if it is tightly integrated.

For i.MX, for now, let's keep the mandatory imx-drm node. Maybe rename
it so nobody can say we are leaking linux subsystem names into the
device tree.
