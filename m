I couldn't find any power sequencing information on the RTL8201CP,
which is what I assume these boards are using.

The RTL8211E does mention after power ramp up, there's a 20ms
delay before the core is ready.

If 20ms works for you, I've nothing against it though. Just putting the
information out there.
