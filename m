Ok, but how does that change using kcalloc over kzalloc? I must have
missed something.

Well sysfs is not really for humans. It's for machines. The nvmem
devices could have a name property so that a more human readable string
is present.

Can you assign the attributes to the device_type in the nvmem::struct
device? I don't see why these attributes need to be part of the class.

I found this post on the cpu class that Sudeep tried to introduce[1].
And there's this post from Kay that alludes to a unification of busses
and classes[2]. And some other post where Kay says class is dead [3].
