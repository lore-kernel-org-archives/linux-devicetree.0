I haven't seen that one before. Thanks.

Indeed.

Apparently, I missed this requirement. It looks like I am going to have to
rework things so that there is some coordination between the PLL and the
PLLDIV clocks in order to get the < 300MHz operating points.

It looks like I am going to have to make a custom implementation for parts
of this clock anyway, so I will probably just make new enable/disable
callbacks that set both OSCDIV_OD1EN and CKEN_OBSCLK.

Yes, I noticed that I missed this after I submitted this series. And I
will have to rework things to coordinate with the PLL as mentioned above.

FYI, I do have cpufreq-dt working, although the LEGO EV3 has a fixed 1.2V
regulator, so I am limited in what I can test. Basically, I can only switch
between 300MHz and 375MHz according to the datasheets. The chip is technically
the 456MHz version. What would happen if I ran it faster or slower with the
wrong voltage?

I omitted it because no one is using it (same reason I left it out of the
device tree bindings). We can certainly add it, though.
