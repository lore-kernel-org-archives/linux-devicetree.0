Sorry for the late reply, I've only been able to test this yesterday.

With "snps,dwmac-mdio" provided in meson-gx.dtsi, the mdio_node is
defined in stmmac_mdio_register and auto-detection of the PHY is
disabled for all meson-gx boards.

I wonder if this is desirable ? or maybe this something we could fix in
stmmac ? (perform auto-detect the mdio bus is provided without a PHY)

Also, I think bisect is broken between patch 1 and patch 4: The PHY of
some boards won't be detected between these patches. Should we squash
them ?

Last remark, about the use of ethernet-phy-idXXXX.XXXX in the odroid
and the vega: Isn't it better to let phylib do the autodetection of the
phy id ?

If we want to specify the id in DT, we should probably add it for the
Micrel PHY of the p200 as well, for consistency.
