You're welcome, but Laurent is the one to "blame" for hooking you
up... :-)

I only added the "bus-type = <0>;" in order to disallow any other
value for the bus-type to make it clear that any non-zero value would
be a bug in the device-tree and not in the driver...

...but I can certainly drop "bus-type = <0>;" from the binding if it
is going away anyway. However, I wonder why it's ok to silently drop
the autodetect meaning of zero? What about old device-trees that do
have that zero there? Are those suddenly not conforming? Wouldn't a
deprecation notice be better so that old existing device-trees can
be parsed/understood even when using modern bindings documentation?

Cheers,
Peter
