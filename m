The property name vddpe-supply is not included in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/qcom,pcie.txt
nor in the pcie-qcom PCIe Root Complex driver.

This property name was used in an initial patchset for pcie-qcom,
but was renamed in a later revision.

Therefore, the regulator is currently never enabled, leaving us with
unoperational wlan.

Fix this by using the correct regulator property name, so that wlan
comes up correctly.

Bluetooth needs a similar patch, but since bluetooth needs some more
work, submit this right now, so we at least have working wlan.
