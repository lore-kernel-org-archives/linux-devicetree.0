I think the guest's PoV is fairly simple and understood. The DMA channel
is pased in as with any passthrough of any other platform device.

No communication with the host is necessary -- an isolated channel is
usable.

The larger concern is isolation, given the lack of IOMMU, or anything
obvious w.r.t. pinning of pages.

I don't believe this requires any context-switch -- it's the same as
assigning any other platform device other than additional proeprties
being controlled in the managament interface.

I'm concerned with how this is safe, and with the userspace interface.
e.g. if the user wants to up the QoS for a VM, how to they find the
right channel in sysfs  to alter?

Likewise.

Thanks,
