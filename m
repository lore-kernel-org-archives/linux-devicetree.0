I have no idea if you need all the clocks or not, but they certainly 
shouldn't be a node per clock. Rather the codec and/or cpu dai should be 
a clock provider and can provide N clocks.

In clock providers, you just add #clock-cells. Then the consumer side 
defines 'clocks'. Which clock(s) comes from the dai is defined by the 
index in the 'clocks' property for that node.

Both ends can be providers, but who is active is determined by defining 
the actual connections with 'clocks'. Or perhaps you have both 
directions shown and there is some other means to select which one is 
active such as solving for who can provide the desired freq.

Hope that helps.
