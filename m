Yes. On the later SoCs such as the A31, the user manual actually has
timing diagrams showing this.

Unlike the TCON, the HDMI controller's timings lists the front porch
separately, instead of an all inclusive Xtotal. This is what made me
look twice. This should be easy to confirm though. Since the HDMI modes
are well known and can be exactly reproduced on our hardware, we can
just check for any distortions or refresh rate errors.

If you drive the display at SDTV resolutions, then yes. Mode lines from
my HDMI monitor:

  720x576i 50 720 732 795 864 576 580 586 625 flags: nhsync, nvsync,
interlace, dblclk; type: driver
  720x480i 60 720 739 801 858 480 488 494 525 flags: nhsync, nvsync,
interlace, dblclk; type: driver
  720x480i 60 720 739 801 858 480 488 494 525 flags: nhsync, nvsync,
interlace, dblclk; type: driver

AFAIK these are standard modes that all devices should support. Whether
they are used daily is another thing. Maybe block modes with dblclk
in .mode_fixup for now?

There's also DDC_SEGMENT_ADDR (which is 0x30) you can use to replace 0x60.
The 1 bit shift is probably something related to I2C.

Hmm, I guess it only serves to debounce the detection, i.e. extend the
time period of validity from the instance the function is run to the
instance plus 500 ms.

To be clear I'm not against it. However this only really works when
the DRM subsystem is brought up. We still need something else for
hotplugging, which is what I was arguing for.
