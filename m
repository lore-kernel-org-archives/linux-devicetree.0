I'm never against allowing users enough rope to hang themselves
as long as the defaults are sensible :)

If there is only ever one sensible answer, fair enough on not being
able to pick and choose.

Would this be directly exposed in terms of the 'maximum value' that
could come out?  If so we could use the existing range description
callbacks (called _available though that's somewhat missleading in
this case).

Sounds to me like it would be sensible to do restrict things somewhat
in the first instance, and perhaps rename them as 'defaults' in the
future if we decide that userspace control does make sense.
Basically do it the first time someone bashes us over the head with
a usecase we aren't supporting well.
