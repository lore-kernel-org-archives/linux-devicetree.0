This hub is an actual USB hub? If so, then you should probably model the 
USB bus topology (which we have a binding definition for).

I'm okay with a hub if it is modeled as a USB hub. Here though, it 
looks like you are just trying to group things which doesn't need to be 
in DT.

You can have generic drivers without a generic binding.
