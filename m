This is the difference between a commercial effort and a hobbyist
effort.  I think I have a plan for how we can both get what we want.  I
could change the argument to 'dtc ... -L arch/arm/boot ...'.  Thus:

$ cd arch/arm/boot
$ ls -l *.dtb        # minus a few columns
...
globalscale,mirabox.dtb -> dts/armada-370-mirabox.dtb
...


This way, aftermarket users (debian installers, etc) could go to the
same place they go for zImages, and find a standard named dtb.  They
wouldn't need to parse the dtbs, just look at the current compatible
string for the board they are installing on and find the matching file.
For commercial efforts, nothing changes, the well-thought out *.dtb
filenames are still in the same place they always were.  A self-imposed
vendor ABI, if you will.

Then, in situations where dts filenames need to change, that can happen
(typically per vendor) because the ABI, from the kernel maintainers pov,
is the symlinks in arch/arm/boot/.

As for the migration, there wouldn't need to be one beyond this first
step of providing symlinks.  That way, vendor-preferred filenames stay
as they are.

Would that work better for you?

thx,

Jason.
