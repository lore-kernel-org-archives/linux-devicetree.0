Hi Lee,

That's impressive ... :D

Ugh ... how messy ... but yes - I agree it may be too late to change
back as rngd already defaults to /dev/hwrng

Perhaps you could just use your time machine to continue back in time
to before it was used :-) In fact can I borrow it after you're done
please :)

Other than 's/2099/2009/g' - The patch is OK. All entries to
/dev/hw_random in hw_random.txt converted,
but outside of Documentation, drivers/char/hw_random/Kconfig also
references /dev/hw_random ...

Therefore perhaps that could be updated in this patch too?
