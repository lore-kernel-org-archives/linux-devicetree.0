I'm not sure what's wrong with that.

I'm not really seeing any configuration problem here. This is an 
artificial problem created by looking at device tree way too 
conservatively, without any significant reason.

Hardware initialization is not really a hack...

Going this way, why to keep any initialization code inside drivers at all? 
Let's initialize USB, MMC, display controllers in the bootloader and just 
make the driver handle user requests assuming that the hardware is already 
initialized.

...or 200 or 300 or 400... (yes, there are platforms which have so many 
elements in their clock networks and they are not uncommon), good luck 
with parsing this at runtime (either with CPU or yourself when reading
a dts file).

It would make some sense if all those basic elements (divs, muxes, gates) 
on all platforms would be identical, but each platform will have its own 
specific quirks, for which such uber-generic binding would have to 
account.

Now, why the other option is to have multiple ways? What's holding us from 
defining a single way of doing so?

Best regards,
Tomasz
