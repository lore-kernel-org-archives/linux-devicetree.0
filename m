Okay. I really think you can easily deal with asynchronous request (I
had a look at the datasheet), but I'll let maintainers decide whether
this is important or not.

I'm not denying the fact that you need some locking, just how this
locking is done: you're preventing the all system from receiving
interrupts for the all time your doing your crypto request.

Here is a suggestion (if you still want to keep the synchronous model,
which IMHO is not a good idea, but hey, that's not my call to make).

1/ wait for the device to be ready (using a waitqueue)
2/ take the lock
3/ check if the engine is busy (already handling another crypto
   request).
4.1/ If the engine is not busy, mark the engine as busy, release the
     lock and proceed with the crytpo request handling.
4.2/ If the engine is busy, release the lock and go back to 1/=20

Hm, you're not even using the interrupts provided by the IP to detect
when the engine is ready to accept new data chunks (which is another
aspect that should be addressed IMO), so I don't get why you need to
disable HW interrupts.
If you just want to disable SW interrupts, you can use spin_lock_bh()
instead of spin_lock_irqsave().

Maybe you can call kmap_atomic when you're in standard context (even if
I'm not sure this is relevant), but you definitely can't call kmap when
you're in atomic context (see the might_sleep() line here [1]). And
since you've taken a spinlock (and disabled all the interrupts) a few
lines above, you're in atomic context here.

Okay, then maybe you should reconsider using readl/writel, unless you
really know why you're using relaxed versions.

Yes...

and I was takling about this specific aspect here.

If that's something you're willing to address in a future version, then
I'm fine with that.

Okay, just sharing my vision of this thing (I'll let Herbert comment on
this aspect): I'd say that theoretically nothing prevents one from
splitting its sg list in chunks smaller than the block size, so I'd
say you should use the same trick for AES.=20
