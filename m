No I am referring to:

(a) PowerPC code relying on cpu nodes to be cpus node's children
(b) code that parses the DT cpus/cpu node for ARM that does require cpu
    nodes to be cpus node's children (but that has nothing to do with
    the bindings, code can be changed)

I think that our definition of cpu nodes does not comply with ePAPR 3.7,
since an MPIDR corresponding to an SMT thread cannot be represented with
one CPU node "A cpu node represents a hardware execution block that is
sufficiently independent that it is capable of running an operating
system without interfering with other CPUs possibly running other
operating systems".

This also has consequences on the cpu node bindings I am about to post
since if we go by the definition above a cpu node representing an SMT
core should contain a list of MPIDRs.

Well yes, that's why we used another (optional) node to define the topology.

Eh, the cluster does have an id, that depends on the MPIDR du jour.
I will give it more thought.

See above, I need to investigate what this implies.

I am not sure what "external" means here, but basically it looks like
our DT cpu bindings are non-compliant, the interrupt controller cannot
address a cpu by using an MPIDR (yet).

Again, see above, HW threads do share an MMU so we have to make a
decision here, either we make ARM comply with ePAPR or change the
bindings for ARM.
