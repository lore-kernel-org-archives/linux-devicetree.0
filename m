As Andrew just brought up, the drivers are common across all of them,
but the registers and irqs are different.  Which would seem to shoot
down the need for an orion.dtsi.

The registers/irqs are common across kirkwood, so the best place
probably is kirkwood.dtsi.

However, if they are placed in kirkwood.dtsi, having compatible =
"mrvl,88f6821-rtc" probably is not a good idea.  Not all kirkwoods have
the same dev_id.

Hehehe that was in the Manual, right?  ;-)

So, in kirkwood.dtsi, compatible = "mrvl,kirkwood-rtc", "mrvl,orion-rtc";

and, drivers without tweaks would match "mrvl,orion-rtc".

Okay.

thx,
