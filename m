You are confusing DTS labels and node names. Labels are global and
just convenience for the DTS source only instead of using full paths
(and can be anything you want). The node name is local to the level it
is at.

label should come from the label property I think. This is one of the
problems with the GPIO sysfs interface and why it is being replaced
with the char dev interface.

Again, I'm talking node names. You are talking labels. And yes, DTS
labels can't use '-'.
