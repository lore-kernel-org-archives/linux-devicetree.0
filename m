Sorry for not carefully reading the docs and many thanks for the helpful comments.

So a gpio driver is responsible to read status of gpio lines and flag any gpio line 
currently configured as out (base on the information read from hardware registers) 
on driver probe time - correct? If yes is the driver allowed to call 
gpiod_get_direction() to have the FLAG_IS_OUT set in the gpiolib layer?

Makes sense.

Thanks again
