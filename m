I understand the logic behind your concern, but I wonder if it is really
an issue. My knowledge ans my background around crypto is very limited,
so I really would like the opinion of other people on the subject.

But I guess that some users will want to use the new driver on the "old" marvell
SoCs (especially kirkwood and dove). If we go to this path, then the best solution
would be to still update all the the dts, and modifying the old driver to be able to
use the new binding: for my point of view the only adaptation should be related
to the SRAM. It will be also needed to find a way to be able to load only one driver
at a time: either the old or the new, but not both.

However I still wonder if it worth the effort.


Thanks,

Gregory
