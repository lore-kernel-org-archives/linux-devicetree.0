Fully agree that we should forget the clk_disable_unused stuff entirely.
Mark's copy above is good, and just for the fun of it I have provided an
alternative version. Feel free to pick and choose what you want:

- clocks: one or more clocks to be enabled.
  Xen hypervisor drivers might replace native OS drivers. The result is
  that some important clocks that are enabled by the OS in the non-Xen
  case are not properly enabled in the presence of Xen. The clocks
  property enumerates the clocks that must be enabled by the Xen clock
  consumer.
  An example is a serial driver enabled by the hypervisor. Xen must
  consume and enable these clocks in the OS to ensure behavior continues
  after firmware configures the UART hardware and corresponding clock
  harder.

Mike
