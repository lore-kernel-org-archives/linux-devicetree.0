Quite honestly this seems totally unrealistic for the majority of users,
especially given the very poor documentation for this stuff which SoC
vendors typically provide.  It's a reasonable amount of work to go back
and figure this stuff out (especially given that it should be varying
depending on the transition in question), and it's going to give us a
bunch of magic numbers in people's bindings.

No, add a new API.

As soon as a regulator is available your code will insist that we're
able to set the voltage specified to set the frequency, and since it's
using tolerances not ranges to whatever the chip maximum is that'll mean
it'll stop doing frequency scaling at all.
