I don't think so. I can't see any commonality of register structure or
data transfer approach (neither PIO nor DMA).

There have been exceptions but, in general, STM32 microcontrollers
seem to have very little in common with ST SoC/ASIC devices except for
the manufacturers id.

I'll take a look although, as above, I suspect any similarities in
structure will be based on the problem domain rather than shared
heritage in the hardware design.

The register window for the STM32 RNG is only 0x400 (and I'll fix the
DT for v2 ;-) ) so the STM32 version isn't primecell-like.

Not sure about this, but I'll take a closer look. There is a certain
family resemblance in the register set but there are significant
differences in data transfer between the Nomadik and STM32 hardware.

Nomadik driver doesn't seem to have to set anything to enable the RNG,
so assuming the CR is resets to zero on nomadik I guess the bit
meaning is inverted on the two platforms.

Bit 3 is reserved on STM32. I don't think the STM32 has logic to hang
the bus if the cell doesn't have data ready (it's not mentioned in the
datasheet but I've not verified what happens if we read when things
are not ready).

I'll fix this. Choosing writel/readl was deliberate (STM32 is a niche
platform so I *really* wanted COMPILE_TEST to work) but this reasons
is no longer relevant.

There are also bits 1 and 2 but these are non-sticky versions of bits
5 and 6 so it should work... but I agree its not very conservative.

I plan to combine both branches into a simple "if (sr != RNG_SR_DRDY)"
since any other value indicates an error condition that we should warn
about anyway.

I'll have to benchmark this. clk_enable/disable have pretty simple
implementations on STM32 so there might not be much in it.

Insisting on minimal power (which I think it important in
microcontroller platforms) does hurt bandwidth more than you might
expect because the framework does not pass big userspace reads to the
underlying driver. This means the costs of clock control are spread
over 32 bytes rather than over the whole of a big read.
