There is no advantage, but it seems to me that the sound device is a
software entity which should not appear in the devicetree.

Russell's "Componentized device handling" would permit to synchronize
all components avoiding the PROBE_DEFERs, but there is a problem with
the tda998x: this one is a component of both the audio and video
subsystems, and the bind() callback does not indicate by which master
compoment it is called...
