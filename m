Sure.

Yes that's how it's used. Presence of subnode with reg=0x14 indicates
clock protocol and #clock-cells to indicate that it's clock provider
expecting 1 parameter from consumer which is the clock identifier.

or do we look through the sub-nodes to

Not this way. Do you see any issues ?

Unfortunately true.

Yes.

I got the concept. But are you also suggesting that in bindings it shmem
should be associated with mailbox controller rather than client ?
