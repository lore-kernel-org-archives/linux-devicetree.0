Ok.

The FIFOs are only 8 frames in size, so I am not sure there is an
issue with these frames being lost.

I think it also makes sense to keep the blocks consistent with each
other. The spdif (out and in), and parallel out, all flush automatically
when stopped, and the fifo for the i2s out block is cleared when the
reset is asserted.
