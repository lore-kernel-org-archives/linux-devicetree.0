That is exactly what I tell folks not to do. Design the DT based on h/w 
blocks, not current desired driver split for some OS.

If there's nothing shared then it is not a syscon. If you can create 
separate address ranges, then 2 nodes is probably okay. If the registers 
are all mixed up, then 1 node.
