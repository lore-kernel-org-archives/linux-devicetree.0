I must admit that my first implementation even used arch_extn (through
the mask/unmask stuff). Then I saw the routable domain stuff, which
looked more like a fit. But when I realized that only GIC has support
for that, I soon realized that this might either need a proper
framework... my hackish NVIC extension probably won't be acceptable...

Stack-able IRQ domain sounds like exactly what I was looking for...

What do you mean by the shared state in the drawing above? Currently, I
check whether a interrupt is already used by the other core by reading
the register (do this configuration register reflect the "shared state"
in your drawing?).

Thanks for the link. So my work would involve to support domain
hierarchy for NVIC (proper irq_domain_ops, introduce arm,routable-irqs
property, anything else?) and then make use of the hierarchy code in my
MSCM driver like for instance the mtk-sysirq driver...?

What is the state of the IRQ domain hierarchy, when will it go upstream?
