FWIW, we asked Pawel to rework the sysreg and config parts of the
vexpress driver, make it an actual MFD driver, and spread the remaining
bits of the code into their respective subsystems. I don't think
this is an eccentric requirement.

Which is what some people think drivers/mfd/ is...
I don't mind merging Lorenzo's SPC driver as it is if he can explain to
me how it will eventually evolve into an actual MFD driver. If that's
not the case, I don't see how I could justify merging it through the
MFD tree.

Cheers,
Samuel.
