Yes obviously this can be done, my main point was that it will require 
building some sort of infra within the driver to handle this. With 
separate nodes, none of this is going to be needed. Also, we will lose 
any kind of configurability via DT if we don't have separate nodes; now 
we can select the available clocks / genpds via the compatible string of 
the clocks/genpd nodes themselves (this isn't clearly evident as of now 
as we only support a grand total of one device, which is k2g-evm.) 
Otherwise we need to probe against the main node and add a separate 
compatible string for every device, and carry this information to the 
sibling devices also somehow. It is just so much simpler if we can just 
keep separate nodes for them.

Also, plenty of things are doing this kind of stuff already in 
DT/kernel, having a parent node in place and sub-functions added 
separately for ease of use, with apparently no visible point for having 
the nodes within the DT.
