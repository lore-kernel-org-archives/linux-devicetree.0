Thanks, that rules out memreserve for this.

The OP-TEE message protocol is primarily for the OP-TEE driver. Other
TEE drivers plugging into this framwork may use this protocol too, but I
guess that most will use their own message protocol.

Provided that each TEE driver rolls their own protocol I'm expecting one
counter part in user space for each TEE driver. The user space client
will know which kind of TEE it's talking to through TEE_IOC_VERSION.

Each client loops through /dev/tee[0-9]* until it finds a TEE it can
communicate with, or if the client is looking for a specific TEE until
it's found. 

TEE_IOC_VERSION is used to tell which kind of TEE the client is talking
to. For a library that implements Global Platforms TEE Client API I
imagine that in TEEC_InitializeContext() the lib will detect which TEE
it's talking to and initialize the TEEC_Context appropriately.

For clients that doesn't care about Global Platform APIs I guess that
they will search for a specific TEE and give up if it's not found.

tee-supplicant is a special case since it's a helper process for the
TEE. The will likely be one tee-supplicant implementation
(tee-supplicant-optee, tee-supplicant-xyz, etc) for each TEE that user
space can support. tee-supplicant is looking for a TEE to connect to
through /dev/teepriv[0-9]*. 

The reason for having /dev/teeX for normal clients and /dev/teeprivX for
tee-supplicants we'd like to have any easy way to set different permission
on the devices.

Each TEE gets its own /dev/teeXX when the specific TEE driver registers
in the framework.

OK, I see the problem. Is it OK only specify the attributes that need to
be compatible like:
#define OPTEE_SMC_SHM_ICACHED           (1 << 0)
#define OPTEE_SMC_SHM_IWRITE_THROUGH    (1 << 1)
#define OPTEE_SMC_SHM_IWRITE_BACK       (1 << 2)
#define OPTEE_SMC_SHM_ISHARABLE         (1 << 3)
#define OPTEE_SMC_SHM_OCACHED           (1 << 4)
#define OPTEE_SMC_SHM_OWRITE_THROUGH    (1 << 5)
#define OPTEE_SMC_SHM_OWRITE_BACK       (1 << 6)
#define OPTEE_SMC_SHM_OSHARABLE         (1 << 7)

#define OPTEE_SMC_SHM_CACHED \
        (OPTEE_SMC_SHM_ICACHED | OPTEE_SMC_SHM_IWRITE_BACK | \
         OPTEE_SMC_SHM_ISHARABLE | OPTEE_SMC_SHM_OCACHED | \
         OPTEE_SMC_SHM_OWRITE_BACK)

I'll drop the OPTEE_SMC_SHM_NONCACHED define as it's currently not used.

OK, I'll make separate structures.
