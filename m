It actually seems a bit silly to put the internal regs into the ranges
property at all. It's not like they need to be translated or provided to
any child nodes. Just give the root node a reg property with the correct
base for the internal regs.

As for regenerating the ranges; I have no problem with the kernel
allocating ranges at runtime, but that code should not be creating a new
ranges property and adding it to the tree. The knowledge should be kept
internal to the driver and it should use an of_bus translator
(drivers/of/address.c) to tap into the ranges parsings code.
