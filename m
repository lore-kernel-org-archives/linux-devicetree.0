Step by step, improve the DT support for the mmci host driver.

This enables us to move the final pieces of platform data for mmci for ux500
into DT. We are then able to remove yet another machine specific file for ux500.

This patchset needs to be merged together. I suggest we go through Russell's
ARM tree, since most of the patches are mmci specific which he maintains -
unless someone think there is a better alternative.

I will thus seek acks from the SOC maintainers as well as the regulator
maintainers. Note, one minor patch was needed for a specific regulator used by
ux500, I assumes it will be a trivial patch to ack, but let's see. :-)

The goal is to queue this for 3.16, thus I might need to rebase the patches for
3.15 rc[n]. Still I would appreciate any comments at this point.
