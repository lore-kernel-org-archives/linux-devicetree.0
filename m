Yes, you're right about that.

Can you change tinydrm_xrgb8888_to_gray8 to match the other
copy/conversion functions so we can pass it a clip rectangle:

int tinydrm_xrgb8888_to_gray8(u8 *dst, void *vaddr,
                 struct drm_framebuffer *fb,
                 struct drm_clip_rect *clip)

And move the import_attach part to the driver (repaper).
repaper doesn't do partial updates, so pass a full clip.

You can't know, and it's part of the review process to sort that out.
That being said, I really should have fixed mi0283qt, because it will
be copied...

You don't need to know all the details. If I make a change, you can
assume that I know what I'm doing and ack it, but I need someone to
look at my patches, I can't apply my own patches without anyone looking
at it, we all make mistakes. And if someone else sends a patch and you
don't know if it is good or not, just ping me and I'll look at it.
Either way I have to look at all tinydrm patches before applying them.
I'm not keen on being default maintainer on drivers that I can't test.
The upside of being a maintainer is that you control the future of the
driver, what changes goes in.

And I'm kind of in the same boat as you, I know tinydrm, but drm is
very complex and I don't know half of what's going on. If I'm stuck or
out of my league, I have to ask for help. Like with adding drm formats.

Noralf.
