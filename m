I think you misunderstood the question. The difference is that in ACPI you
are required to specify the domain, while in DT it is optional with your
implementation.

I think in general it would be nice if we could mandate that in DT you also
have to always provide a domain number, however the problem is that we can't
change the existing DTB files that people are using that do not specify a
domain.

We could possibly make this an architecture specific setting though and
mandate that all ARM64 platforms have to set it, while ARM32 does not need
it.
