Given what it fixes, arm-soc probably makes the most sense.

Daughterboards on connectors is one. Another somewhat different case
is non-probeable buses hanging off of probeable devices where the host
system may not even be DT based. For example, GPIOs, I2C, UART, etc.
devices behind a USB serial chip and standard USB connector.

Agreed. I'm happy for you to own that. ;)
