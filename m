The general rule is that regulators should only be omitted if they are
physically absent, we can describe simple fixed supplies with no control
so we should do so (though in practice Linux is much more forgiving and
will provide one if the supply is just plain missing from the DT).  This
is a simpler rule for people to follow than making them officially
optional and is more robust in the face of things like implementation
changes that allow supplies to become controlable or drivers that
suddenly form a desire to look at their supply voltages, as well as
allowing other OSs to have simpler implementations if it's followed.
