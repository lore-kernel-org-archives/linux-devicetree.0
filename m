Jason,

Sounds pretty much like what we are doing.  I am using u-boot and my
current code looks like this:

        /*
         * Peripheral Config:
         *  remove nodes by alias path if EEPROM config tells us the
         *  peripheral is not loaded on the board.
         */
        if (!test_bit(EECONFIG_ETH0, info->config))
                fdt_del_node_and_alias(blob, "ethernet0");
        if (!test_bit(EECONFIG_ETH1, info->config))
                fdt_del_node_and_alias(blob, "ethernet1");
        if (!test_bit(EECONFIG_HDMI_OUT, info->config))
                fdt_del_node_and_alias(blob, "hdmi_out");
        if (!test_bit(EECONFIG_SATA, info->config))
                fdt_del_node_and_alias(blob, "ahci0");
        if (!test_bit(EECONFIG_PCIE, info->config))
                fdt_del_node_and_alias(blob, "pcie");
        if (!test_bit(EECONFIG_SSI0, info->config))
                fdt_del_node_and_alias(blob, "ssi0");
        if (!test_bit(EECONFIG_SSI1, info->config))
                fdt_del_node_and_alias(blob, "ssi1");
...

I've submitted my code to u-boot and have been asked if its more
appropriate to remove nodes as I'm doing above or to mark them as
'disabled'.  From what I can tell there really isn't a rule or
recommendation for this so I think I'll keep doing what I'm doing
above.

Thanks!

Tim
