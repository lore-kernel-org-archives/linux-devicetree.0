The current problem with simple-fb is that the clock subsystem
contains code to automatically shut off clocks that aren't in use. A
similar problem exists for regulators. And I agree that code like that
makes sense.

Simplefb does not mark these items as being in use, so they get shut
off. So how can we communicate to these subsystems that these
clocks/regulators are actually in use by simple-fb? Simple-fb is
generic code and it does not know about specific devices or clocks or
regulators.

Uboot could individually mark each one.  But then how does uboot tell
the OS that a simple-fb has been set up? You could make a node like
'chosen/framebuffer'. But then how do you tell where the reserved
memory is? Making a <boot> node inside the specific device makes more
sense to me. That also makes it easy to determine what
clock/regulators apply.

Also note that things like the console are also vulnerable to this. If
I switch from a built-in serial driver over to a modprobe one, the
UART clocks will get disabled in the interval between the clk shut off
code and the loading of the module. This is the same window that makes
the framebuffer flicker during boot.  And generic ARM kernels modprobe
in all of their drivers.
