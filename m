It will if the SPDIF stream is already running when the driver is started 
up, but if for some reason the sample rate changes or the SPDIF source is 
not transmitting anything when the stream is started it won't work to do 
it hw_params. A changing sample rate might be an unusual usecase, but one
could imagine having an SPDIF source which is silent (e.g. not even 
plugged in) when the stream is set up.

Like I said, it might not be a problem in many applications. And I'm not 
really sure how to solve it. Perhaps someone else knows. ALSA likes to be 
in control of parameters such as the sample rate, but it can't with an 
external device controlling the sample rate of the SPDIF receiver.
