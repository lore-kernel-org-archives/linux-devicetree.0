Subject: [PATCH v2] ARM: dts: da850: Add new ECAP and EPWM bindings

From: "Cooper Jr., Franklin" <fcooper@ti.com>

For some devices, the PWMSS is a parent of eCAP and ePWM and provided the
functional clocks for those submodules. The ti,am33xx-ecap and
ti,am33xx-ehrpwm were based on this parent child relationship where the
functional clock would be grabbed from the module's parent.

However, DA850 doesn't have a PWMSS and the eCAP and ePWM provides their
functional clock themselves. Therefore, prefer the new binding that doesn't
assume this parent child relationship.
