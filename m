We need to deal with the debug and CPU power domains.

For the former I suggest we do what coresight does and use the
"power-domains" binding[1].  For the CPU power domain we can re-use
the "nohlt" flag.  In the probe function if the "nohlt" cmd line flag
is not set the code bails out.  If it is set pm_runtime_put() is _not_
called and the driver can be used without worries of hanging the
system when the panic handler is invoked.

Am I forgetting something?
