I can test the cpufreq-dt.  Are there additional patches or are they
part of the same git repo I have been testing?

The DA850 I have may not run all the way to highest speed, but I'll
see what I can find.  I think I had a few at one point, but I don't
think it was part of Logic PD's standard product lineup.
