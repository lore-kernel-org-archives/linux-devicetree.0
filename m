Right now there isn't any power collapse support in mainline so
there's no immediate problem. Once we add power collapse support
(i.e. cpuidle) to the Scorpion and Krait platforms we'll need to
do something in the perf event code to properly maintain the
counts across idle. I imagine it would be done by registering for
cpu_pm notifications and then doing the save/restore on
CPU_PM_ENTER and CPU_PM_EXIT. At least, that's what you started
doing in this patch[1]. And then it seems the patch you mention
came after that and actually did the save/restore of the counts.
