Stephen Warren posted some patches to fix this.  The u-Boot maintainer 
was having some "issues" with them.  I don't know if this has been 
resolved at this point.

Of course this would help if more people other than Stephen and myself 
were putting some pressure on the maintainer for this problem to get 
fixed satisfactorily.

I have changes to the kernel which are pending some resolution on the 
u-Boot side for this very issue at the moment which is getting rather 
annoying.  If nothing moves I might just go ahead with those changes and 
simply rip the uImage make target out of the kernel as well.  Maybe the 
inconvenience will be a sufficient incentive for people to lobby proper 
u-Boot support.  And it is not like if the u-Boot patches didn't exist 
already.
