I don't think that works.

The include path used is "include", which means that we force people
to use:

#include <dt-bindings/foo.dtsi>

in their DT files.  This means that we'd need to populate $topdir/include
with per-architecture symlinks on top of the 26 or so directories already
there, so that:

#include <arch/foo.dtsi>

would work.  That's quite horrible, since $topdir/include is the main
include path for C headers.

I guess we could have symlinks inside include/dt-bindings, but that
makes the includes:

#include <dt-bindings/arch/foo.dtsi>

but that's rather absurd because these _aren't_ dt-binding definitions.

Maybe what we should do is:

mkdir include/dt
git mv include/dt-bindings include/dt
for arch in arch/*; do
  dts=$arch/boot/dts
  if [ -d $dts ]; then
     a=include/dt/$(basename $arch)
     ln -s $dts $a
     git add $a
  fi
done
... fixup scripts/Makefile.lib ...
