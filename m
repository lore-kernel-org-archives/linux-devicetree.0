Yes, thats correct, further :

Section H9.2.32: EDPCSR

"For a read of EDPCSRlo from the memory-mapped interface, if EDLSR.SLK == 1, meaning
the Software Lock is locked, then the access has no side-effects. That is, EDCIDSR,
EDVIDSR, and EDPCSRhi are unchanged."

And since we do a CS_UNLOCK, that should be fine. Please ignore my comment.

You're correct. Thanks for the pointer. I got confused, as there was no bit
dedicated in the DBGPCSR bit assignment figure.

Ok.

Also we need pm_runtime_put() here to balance the pm_runtime_get_ from AMBA
device probe. More on that below.

Btw, I don't see any PM calls to make sure the power domain (at least the debug domain)
is up, which could cause problems with accesses to some of these registers (leave alone the
ones in CPU power domain), especially the EDPRSR. We could also do pm_runtime_get on the
CPU's power domain, if the CPU is online, before we access the pcsr.
