Reading your patch, it looks like to handle the two different firmware
files, you're simply adding a command-line switch, there is no
detection involved.
Am I understanding correctly?
If this is the case, two things:
1. I'm not too sure having the user choose this via cmdline is the
right way. I think I'd rather have it set by userspace. (though that's
not a strong opinion).
Or if cmdline is being changed... how about having DTS (or just an
overlay on top of it) being changed instead?

2. This could still be declared by DTS. For instance, assuming your
i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match:
&i2c0 {
        touchscreen1: gsl1680@40 {
                reg = <0x40>;
                compatible = "silead,gsl1680";
                enable-gpios = <&pio 7 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PH1 */
                touchscreen-size = <1024 600>;
                touchscreen-fw = "gsl1680-a082-q8-700.fw";
                filter-names = "touchscreen_variant";
                filter-0 = "none", "gsl1680-a082-q8-700";
                id = <0xa0820000>;
                status = "disabled";
        };
        touchscreen2: gsl1680@40 {
                reg = <0x40>;
                compatible = "silead,gsl1680";
                enable-gpios = <&pio 7 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PH1 */
                touchscreen-size = <480 800>;
                touchscreen-fw = "gsl1680-a082-q8-a70.fw";
                filter-names = "touchscreen_variant";
                filter-0 = "gsl1680-a082-q8-a70";
                id = <0xa0820000>;
               status = "disabled";
        };
        touchscreen2: gsl1680@40 {
                reg = <0x40>;
                compatible = "silead,gsl1680";
                enable-gpios = <&pio 7 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>; /* PH1 */
                touchscreen-size = <960 640>;
                touchscreen-fw = "gsl1680-b482-q8-d702.fw";
                filter-names = "touchscreen_variant";
                filter-0 = "gsl1680-b482-q8-d702";
                id = <0xb4820000>;
               status = "disabled";
        };
        i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match = <&touchscreen1>,
<&touchscreen2>, <&touchscreen3>;
}

With "none" value being the value when the "touchscreen_variant"
option is not defined in cmdline.

Please note that I'm not too sure whether SILEAD_REG_ID represents an
OTP which can be changed by OEM, or if it's more of a hardware
revision. Depending on this, this would either fit into a id =
<0xa0820000> DTS line, or a compatible = "silead,gsl1680_a082",
"silead,gsl1680"; DTS line.

How about something like:

&i2c1 {
    touchscreen1....
    touchscreen2....
    touchscreen3....
    accelerometer1....
    accelerometer2....
    accelerometer3....
    accelerometer4....

    select-one {
       compatible = "i2c-select;
       group-names = "touchscreen", "accelerometer";
       group-0 = <&touchscreen1>, <&touchscreen2>, <&touchscreen3>;
       group-1 = <&accelerometer1>, <&accelerometer2>,
<&accelerometer3>, <&accelerometer4>;
    };
};

Right, so let's concentrate on reasonable bus-es first then. (I can
think of I2C and DSI)

I do believe this can all be done in DTS, and at the moment, what
you're describing seem to happen often enough to be worth writing
generic code for.
But then, I can't really tell which makes the most sense between
source-based and devicetree-based.
I prefer doing it in device-tree, since it means that any OEM can have
his device supported by only providing DTB, and won't need to provide
kernel patches.

With things like mount-matrix devicetree property, the goal is to have
such informations in the DTS.
I'm not seeing every cases should be handled in DTS, but ATM I see no
good reason.
