Yes; status defaults to "okay" (presumably this is listed in
the overal DT binding spec somewhere), and secure-status
defaults to "same as status, which might in turn be defaulted".
We can list the complete set of options (neither present,
both 'okay', status not present but secure-status present, etc),
though it gets a bit long-winded, especially if we later add
more secure- properties (they'd all have to have verbiage about
"if not present, same as non-prefixed property; if both not
present, both take the default the non-prefixed property takes
if it's not present; if prefixed property not present, it
defaults to same as non-prefixed property", which we already
say in the introductory section). Still, for just status it
would be easy enough to add a couple of lines:

+    status = "okay"; secure-status = "okay"; // ditto
+    secure-status = "okay";                  // ditto
+    // neither explicitly defined: ditto

(Do you want the full set of 9 options you get from multiplying
out "okay" vs "disabled" vs not-set for each property?)

It's perfectly possible to design hardware like that (though
I can't think of a reason to do so offhand). I think it's the desire
to be able to describe all the possible valid h/w combinations
that brought us to this secure- prefix design. Plus it
extends nicely to cover other possibilities as we need it;
for instance "device A is at S-0x10000 but NS-0x20000" can be
done by specifying a device like:
   status = "okay";
   secure-status = "okay";
   reg = < 0x20000 0x1000 >;
   secure-regs = < 0x10000 0x1000 >;
(apologies if I've messed the syntax up there).

Just going for 'status=secure' would deal with the immediate
requirement, but my preference is for a description that
lets us describe all the possible configurations, not just
the ones we think are common, and secure-* is a neat way
of doing that (IIRC it was Grant's suggestion; speaking of
whom, I just noticed I forgot to cc him on the original patch).
