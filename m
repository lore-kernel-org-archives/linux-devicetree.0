I didn't say we can't define regulator supply properties as optional in the DT 
binding.  If we define them as such and any of these *-supply properties is 
missing in DT with regulator_get() the regulator core will use dummy regulator 
for that particular voltage supply.  While with regulator_get_optional() 
-ENODEV is returned when the regulator cannot be found.

We should not be defining DT binding only with selected use cases/board
designs in mind.  IMO all three voltage supplies should be listed in the
binding, presumably all can be made optional, with an assumption that when
the property is missing selected pin is hooked up to a fixed regulator.
