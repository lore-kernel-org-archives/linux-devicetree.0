You're right, I'll remove the 'bool completed'.

OK, I'm updating these functions with more comments. The purpose of
these functions is to deal with resource shortage in secure world.
There's a limit on how many threads that execute concurrently in secure
world. optee_cq_wait_for_completion() waits for any task returning from
a call to secure world, optee_cq_complete_one() doesn't care who's
completed as long as tasks aren't stuck when there's available resources
in secure world.

Thanks, I'll update.

The platform device(s) are created here because the optee node is below
"/firmware" instead of the root where it would have had the platform
device created automatically.

I think it's useful to be able to unload the module, the early reviews
of this patch set was much focused around that. Regardless I'll need
some device as parent for the devices created during optee_probe() and
using a platform device for that seems natural.

I'd rather keep the platform driver. Perhaps some variant of the pattern
in qcom_scm_init() (drivers/firmware/qcom_scm.c) is useful, except that
I need to find out what to do about the life cycle of the objects
created with of_platform_populate().

Does the platform devices really need cleaning? I mean
of_platform_default_populate_init() creates a bunch of platform devices
which are just left there even if unused. Here we're doing the same
thing except that we're doing it for a specific node in the DT.

You're right, OPTEE_MSG_OS_OPTEE_REVISION_* should be removed. The
actual version the secure OS is of a mostly informational nature. The
same goes the OS UUID, but I suppose the actual UUID used by the
upstream version of OP-TEE OS could be interesting to know.

The UUID and version of the message protocol are important to match
correctly as otherwise it could mean that there's something unexpected
in secure world that following the message protocol would be undefined
behaviour. All changes to the message protocol should be backwards
compatible in the sense that the driver and secure world need to
negotiate eventual extensions while probing. That's what we're doing in
optee_msg_exchange_capabilities().

I'm updating the comments for OPTEE_MSG_RPC_CMD_WAIT_QUEUE with:
"If secure world need to wait for a secure world mutex it issues a sleep
request instead of spinning in secure world. Conversely is a wakeup
request issued when a secure world mutex with a thread waiting thread is
unlocked."

The way we're waking up a sleeping thread is a bit limiting in some
circumstances.

One case is where we need to do it from a secure interrupt handler.
Because there's no way of doing this kind of RPC to normal world from a
secure interrupt handler. In that case it wouldn't be mutex the thread
is waiting for though.

Another case is where there's several guest running in the system and
more than one guests has access to secure world. If guest2 waits for
mutex which guest1 is releasing, how can guest2 be notified? Normal RPC
is impossible here also.

The only way around this limitation I've come up with so far is by doing
the wakeup via a software generated interrupt destined to the correct
guest. However this problem is beyond the scope of this patch set.

OK.
