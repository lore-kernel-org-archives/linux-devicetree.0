Apparently, it's supported since 3.0.0, that got released on the 24th
of february.

I mass converted the yaml-bindings code to use the draft 7, and the
tests are passing (and a dtbs_check run seems legit too). So that went
smoothly...

... except that after adding if, then and else to the meta-schemas, a
schema using that construct doesn't do anything (well, anything more
than what it is doing without if / then / else).

Apart from the fact that it doesn't work as expected (yet), the syntax
is pretty elegant, so I guess we should go for that.
