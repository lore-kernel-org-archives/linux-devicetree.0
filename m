    I remember I suggested "usb-xhci" but the author didn't want to do it and 
I said that I have no strong opinion (along with Alan Stern, IIRC), so we have 
it now...

    Sorry, I have been generally lacking the time to read linux-usb recently.
I only bumped into your patch randomly, despite me being interested in this 
matter for my own platform...

    Not true about it being entirely PPC specific: the driver actually looks 
for another "compatible" property to make it truly PPC specific (and apply 
some errata fixes for that specific PPC platform) and "usb-ehci" is used in 
many non-PPC binding examples as a backup still. Valentine Barshak's did his 
work on ehci-ppc-of.c when DT was used only on PPC and SPARC, so it was kind 
of a honest mistake on his part to name the driver so that people would think 
it's PPC specific (not only his, it seems, as the driver was based on the 
other two). This does not seem a fatal mistake, and we could limit the driver 
to match only on that IBM 440EPx platform it was designed for and tested on, 
making ehci-platform.c handle "usb-ehci". This is more work but I believe it's 
the Right Thing. The problem is that we'll have to do this atomically with 
ehci-platform.c change since 2 other PPC platforms use "usb-ehci" as a backup 
to their specific "compatible" props and don't have the platform-specific 
drivers for them, and we probably wouldn't want to break them.
I would like to help you here but the matter is not urgent for me, so cannot 
work on it right now... :-(
    Anyway, I'm strongly against such names as "mmio-[eo]hci". But I could 
live with just "[eo]hci" if you don't follow my advice and unravel the 
ehci-ppc-of.c knot...
