Hi Christoffer,

Qemu or kvmtool. I never know what generic term to use for these.
virtual-machine-monitor?

Yes, good point.

I was expecting this patch to provoke some wider discussion on how to delegate
SMCCC/HVC calls to user space. Do we want per-API KVM_CAP's, or one that dumps
the whole range on user-space when enabled. It came up (as a tangent) on another
thread:

Qemu 2.2.0 in ubuntu 15.04 ignores the 'sdei_version' hvc/hypercall-exit and
re-enters the guest with the registers unmodified. I think this is 'weird', I
assumed it would exit.

I'm probably being too trusting here. Today an unknown HVC will cause KVM to
inject an undef, whereas with this change it might get handled by user-space if
the kernel recognises the range, and user-space might just skip the HVC and
carry on...

I will change this to support KVM_CAP_ENABLE_CAP_VM to enable the SDEI CAP and
pass that HVC range through to user-space using KVM_EXIT_HYPERCALL and
populating as much of that structure as makes sense...

You're right it doesn't depend on anything in KVM, but adding it unconditionally
here will enable it on 32bit too, and the spec says this is aarch64 only. So
#ifdef ARM64 would have been better.

That works fine (its how it was developed!).

'Virtual machine monitors' should be able to pick a RAS notification method for
guests independently of what the host is using (if anything). If this doesn't
work it means we've accidentally created some ABI.


Thanks,

James
