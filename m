Ah ok, I am relieved its only for controller-client, and not for the api :)
Yes I will use mhu_mbox_message as you suggest.

I don't think we could sleep there but that should be ok because the
code is used only when we don't have mailbox framework ready i.e, in
very early boot before timers are ready and also as late as during
reboot/poweroff. Also I realize long delays like those for I2C would
never use this code - they would always have mailbox usable during
their lifetime.

The remote f/w expects data to be contiguous and we can't assume how
it reads the packet. So our firstmost priority is to have no holes in
the region... like, say, USB descriptors.
