The fact that you have no-map means that the memory should not be
described to the kernel as mappable in the first place. It's wrong to
place such memory in the memory node, even if listed in reserved-memory.

If your EFI memory map describes the memory as mappable, it is wrong.

If the memory shouldn't be mapped, it should neither be in the memory
node nor EFI memory map (with attributes allowing it to be mapped) to
begin with.

As far as I can see you do not need to use reserved-memory.

Thanks,
Mark.
