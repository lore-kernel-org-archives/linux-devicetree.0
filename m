So you want to have generic bindings for every clock which implies a
bunch of nodes if not a node per clock anyway, but then object to 3
nodes for fixed clocks.

I don't think I've ever seen a chip with more than 3 clock inputs
anyway. There are cases with additional clocks like a CMOS sensor or
audio chip which provides a fixed input clock, but those clocks should
reside with the nodes that generate them.

I'm talking about the bindings and you are pointing me to an
implementation with no bindings. It's 2 different things. The
implementation can fully be the generic clk implementations, but the
clock bindings can still be either a node per clock or a monolithic
clock module node. There is no fixed rule here and there should not be.
We can each chose what works best for us.

I see a couple of examples that your clocks are still SoC specific
despite your claims.

Your clock gates may reuse clk_gate struct, but they still have custom
ops to handle the 2-bit field. Obviously, you decided not to merge 2-bit
field support into the existing clk gate code (the correct decision
IMHO). I made a similar decision.

For practically every clock, you need to set the spinlock to
imx_ccm_lock. How are you going to know which clocks to set this lock
for with a "generic" binding? You have to distinguish those from IPU
clocks for example.
