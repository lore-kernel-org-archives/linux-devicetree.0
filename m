#define field_relaxed(addr, mask, val) \
	writel_relaxed((readl_relaxed(addr) & mask) | val, addr)

Is it time to remove this useless code?

When the I/O registers are in memory (that's the case), you may access
them (read and write) thru /dev/mem.
Also, is a register access trace really needed in this driver?

The pain is to define the regmap_config (which registers can be
read/write/volatile and which can be the values the u-boot let us in
the registers at startup time), and the lot of code which is run instead
of simple load/store machine instructions.
