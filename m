I was confused by a node being its own parent, but that seems to be the
case elsewhere for parent_node() implementations. Please at least have a
comment that we're assuming a flat hierarchy (for now).

I am recommending that we make the relationship explicit. If anything,
using the cpu-map (with phandles) seems like a better approach.

Sure. Moving the "NUMA turned off" print into numa_setup would mean you
could just print "Using dummy NUMA layout" or something to that effect
here -- the function has no need to care about the value of numa_off.

I meant the longtrail workaround, hence my comments on that below.

I've Cc'd a few people who have worked on the stub and/or EFI memory map
stuff. It would be worth keeping them on Cc so as to keep them informed.

I believe that the EFI stub is doing the right thing by ensuring that
the EFI memory map is used, so this is just another configuration that
your binding has to consider.
