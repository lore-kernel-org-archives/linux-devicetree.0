OK, now I understand what you mean. Maybe you should phrase it a bit 
differently to make it clearer ? How about

dc-gpios: Specified or the GPIO connected to the panel's D/C pin (also called 
A0). The property is required when the panel operates in 4-wire mode (IF[3:1] 
= 011) and prohibited when the panel operates in 3-wire mode (IF[3:1] = 010).

By the way, if the signal is named A0, why don't you call the property a0-
gpios ?

My bad, I should have read the panel datasheet before replying :-S Please 
ignore this comment.
