Thanks for all the comments Vinod. Looks like I made a bad judgement, 
clearly I wouldn't want to rewrite the code twice :) I'll take a closer 
look at using the framework and maybe start with the features that we 
know will work and build up the rest incrementally and address problems 
from there.

Thanks,
