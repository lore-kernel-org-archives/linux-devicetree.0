Driver complexity: obviously.

DT is only meant to abstract away the configuration part.

That is effectively the point of DT.

This is not a new problem.  Before you had to figure out which kernel 
would go with which board.

That's the bootloader's job.  Nothing magical actually: just have U-Boot 
or whatever load the DTB from some flash area.

For one target, this is indeed the simplest way.

I kinda agree with you, but this is too late for that now.

We have DT, and the best way forward is to fix the process which is, 
arguably, somewhat obstructive and broken at the moment.
