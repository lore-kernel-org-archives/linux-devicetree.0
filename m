We already have platform-uhci too, and this matches the name of
the .c file so that people can actually correlate the 2.

I can make OHCI_MAX_CLKS 4 or 8 if that makes you happy, other then
that I greatly prefer to keep this KISS. Devices with 3 clks are already
quite rare, so its not like we're going to need to bump this every other
week a linked list where a simple array suffices is just overkill and
unnecessarily complicates things.

This can already be done by having a platform driver with its own
compatible string providing platform data with the hooks. The whole idea
here is to avoid having to write such a glue driver for every other soc,
so cover the common simple case, and use glue drivers for more complicated
scenarios.

Lets first get the generic devicetree support merged as is, if after
that people want to extend it, so that (more) existing ohci drivers can
be removed, they are very much welcome to do so. Preferably people
with access to the hardware, so that they can actually test the changes.

Add-on patches extending my initial work are welcome. Again probably
best done by people who actually have access to the relevant hw.
