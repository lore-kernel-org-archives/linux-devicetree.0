=46or aes_cbc it exists a test with 3 SG with .tap =3D { 496 - 20, 4, 1=
6 }
But my driver handle that. (multiple of 4)

What do you think about adding a test with 16 SG of 1 byte ? (or 3 + 2 =
+ 3 + 8 * 1)

=46urthermore, I need to re-read testmgr.h but it seems that no aes tes=
t exists with odd SG size.
