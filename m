I think I start to understand the point here: If a user only needs to playback
the default case - 44.1KHz for example, the driver can just configure all the
dividers once at the beginning, not every time, so that we can save further
register overriding operation or even complicated clock selection and divisor
calculation, which obviously makes the procedure clean and reduces the system
loading even if it might be just in a slight level.

Is this the reason, or maybe one of the reasons, to the defaults providing?
