Correct, which is why Doug's changes allow chaining of handlers.

Sure, but that still allows you to send the correct signal to a faulting
application (unless I am missing something here).

Which is exactly what is being done here, with the help of platform
specific information (we would not load brcmstb_gisb.c if we were not on
a platform where it makes sense to use that HW).

OK, that could presumably be fixed though.

I disagree here, since this is a platform specific SError exception that
we can actually handle correctly there is a chance to actually not take
down the system on something that can be made non fatal and informative
at the same time.

Partially disagree, in the absence of a way to specifically deal with
the exception, I would almost agree, but this is not the case here, we
have a piece of HW that can help us locate the problem, display an
informative message, and send a SIGBUS to the faulting application.

Anyway, I won't argue much further than that, but I certainly don't
think taking down an entire system is going to prove itself useful when
you need to deploy such a kernel to hundreds of people who have no clue
what so ever what their actual problem is in the first place. Taking a
SIGBUS and printing a message can at least allow us to say: read more
carefully, it say exactly what's wrong.
