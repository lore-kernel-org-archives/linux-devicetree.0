PCIe link up fails with few legacy endpoints if root port advertises both
Gen-1 and Gen-2 speeds in Tegra. This is because link number negotiation
fails if both Gen1 & Gen2 are advertised. Tegra doesn't retry link up by
advertising only Gen1. Hence, the strategy followed here is to initially
advertise only Gen-1 and after link is up, retrain link to Gen-2 speed.

Tegra doesn't support HW autonomous speed change. Link comes up in Gen1
even if Gen2 is advertised, so there is no downside of this change.

This behavior is observed with following two PCIe devices on Tegra,
 - Fusion HDTV 5 Express card
 - IOGear SIL - PCIE - SATA card

V4: No change

V3: No change

V2: Updated commit log to reflect why this issue is observed on Tegra with
these particular cards
