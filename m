I do not represent all linux kernel developers by any means. I am just 
stating current policy of SoC/board support maintained by ARM Linux, which 
is common for all Linux kernel devlopers, or at least ARM Linux kernel 
developers.

Personally I am happy with numerous companies backing this policy and not 
making problems like this with Allwinner and I am really surprised that 
you are supporting a troublesome company like this.

There are many other SoC vendors making low cost SoCs, like Rockchip, 
Boxchip, Telechips. Maybe they would be better candidates for being 
promoted as vendors of choice for hardware running free software? (Just 
saying, as I do not know anything about their view on this. There is a lot 
of cheap tablets built using their products as well.)

Best regards,
Tomasz
