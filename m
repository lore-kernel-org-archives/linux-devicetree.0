So, i can add stuff in board file for pinmux for now?

Would make it very confusing if we merge these two. Some clock
structures are same, but others are not. Mostly differences are in the
macros (or bit positions in registers), rather than hierarchy. So, i would
like to keep them separate. But still have a look again to see if they can
really be merged.

it has more than clock stuff. it is used in pinmux and some other places to=
o,
that may not be in mainline for now.

plat-spear would be required for 13xx too. So, merging 3xx and 6xx only wou=

be possible.

Ya. I just wanted to get some hands on experience with this new stuff, befo=

touching 13xx.

But, can i update padmux and clock framework of SPEAr platform? Because
without the latest code for both padmux and clock, other code for SPEAr
might not be that effective or usable.

Sure.
