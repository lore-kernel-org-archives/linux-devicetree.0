Hi Rob,

Reviving an old thread -- "rock" and "hard place" come to mind.

Having looked at the proposals, I'm personally much keener on the approach
above (modulo naming and wording) than trying to bolt memory nodes onto a UEFI
system, or using reserved-memory to describe the inverse of the allowable
range.

I completely agree that we want one solution for DT-only and DT+UEFI.

While those approaches reuse existing infrastructure, they end up creating more
work, and I believe that they create more scope for painful problems. As kdump
is already a constrained case, I think that it's reasonable to have a
linux-specific property as above.

I also think we need to figure out how we expect this to work for the
kexec_file_load case, as that has a criticial impact on the above (e.g. what's
preferable out of cmdline options vs dt properties).

Can we try to sync at connect to discuss this?

Thanks,
Mark.
