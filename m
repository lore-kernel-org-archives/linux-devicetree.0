That looks reasonable.

Ok.

Yes, this is the example I was thinking of. For mbus, we decided that
doing the full dynamic reassignment of addresses is too bothersome
for the OS, so the DT contains a "reasonable" default that the OS can
use. This is also what we do for most PCI host controllers on embedded
systems. They tend to have programmable translations, and the DT contains
the settings that are known to work and that the driver uses to set up
the I/O windows even if a lot of other settings would work just as
well.

A more traditional setup that we use on server-class machines is that
the bootloader decides what the windows should be, sets them up and
documents them in DT. The OS can still change them if it wants to,
but it doesn't actually have to worry about the fact that those are
programmable, or what registers are used for programming them.
