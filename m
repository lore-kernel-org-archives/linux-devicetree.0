Hi Artem and Huang,

thank you for your feedback!

Bad news is: No

Good news is: The previous DMA operation finished with an interrupt
which according to the manual should already corresponds to this
condition. Tests show that at this point of sampling:

>>> +       timeout = LPC32XX_DMA_SIMPLE_TIMEOUT;
>>> +       while ((readl(SLC_STAT(host->io_base))&  SLCSTAT_DMA_FIFO)
>>> +&&  (timeout>  0))
>>> +               timeout--;

... the condition is always true and always just jumps over this loop,
at least with my hardware.

As I understand loops_per_jiffy, this loop will take much longer than
the 100 ms you defined above?

Anyway, I will keep the loop for safety reasons, add an msleep() and add
a warning, should the loop be entered _at all_.

Maybe someone from NXP can give us more insight here? Maybe the
condition check isn't necessary anymore after I ported the driver to
dmaengine (this controller is always wired together with an amba-pl080
in the LPC32xx)?

Thanks in advance,

Roland
