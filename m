I just had a quick look to see what sig_bits does, yes this is a good
addition. Will post a follow-up patch based on the driver that you
already accepted into your tree.

(Btw I'm working on another codec driver and I don't stop getting
positively surprised how flexible and powerful the overall ASoC
framework is).
