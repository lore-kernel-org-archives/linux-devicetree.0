There are already bus-specific transations available. Take a look at
struct of_bus in drivers/of/address.c

Yes, the problem is that the DT probably can't have an accurate set of
ranges for the devices under the PCIe bus since they are dynamically
assigned. It would be really nice to wire this up properly so that the
DT states the layout of stuff behind the bar, but leaves it to the OS to
assign PCI regions.

However, if firmware enumarates PCI and wants that to be passed through
to the OS, then the DT really should be updated... even in that case
though Linux should be able to pick up the PCI settings from the BAR
registers and use those for dynamics translation.
