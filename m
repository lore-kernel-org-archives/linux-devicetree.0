If set_sysclk() is never allowed to do anything other than forward the
value it receives to the clock API, I'm much less concerned, althoguh
still a bit.

My main worry is that this patch opens the door for set_sysclk() to
perform some kind of calculation to determine the MCLK rate. Right now,
this patch doesn't do that, but there's nothing obvious from the code
that no CODEC is allowed to do that. After all, sysclk has a parameter
to indicate *which* clock in the CODEC to set. Some CODEC driver author
might write something where the machine driver tells the CODEC driver
the desired rate of some CODEC-internal PLL, from which set_sysclk()
calculates what it needs for MCLK, and then goes off and requests that
value from the clock API.

Ignoring that, I'm still not sure that the CODEC driver setting the MCLK
rate is appropriate. If we have 1 MCLK output from an SoC, connected to
2 different CODECs, why wouldn't the overall machine driver call
clk_set_rate() on that clock, and then notify the two CODEC drivers of
that rate. Making each CODEC's set_sysclk() call clk_set_rate() on the
same clock with the same value seems redundant, albeit it should work
out fine since they both request the same rate.
