Replacing DSP-based drivers with LPASS-based drivers would be something that
should be handled by Kconfig selections.  For the DT, the DSP-related
nodes and the LPASS-related nodes shouldn't overlap.  There should be a
DSP-based DT binding and a separate LPASS-based DT binding.  Tying one
or the other to the sound node (but not both), should work.
