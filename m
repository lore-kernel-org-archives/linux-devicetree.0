Prior to this patch, v4.7-rc6 would lock up immediately after:

[    0.000000] L2C OF: override cache size: 1048576 bytes (1024KB)
[    0.000000] L2C OF: override line size: 32 bytes
[    0.000000] L2C OF: override way size: 131072 bytes (128KB)
[    0.000000] L2C OF: override associativity: 8
[    0.000000] L2C: DT/platform modifies aux control register: 0x02020000 -> 0x02080000
[    0.000000] L2C: DT/platform tries to modify or specify cache size
[    0.000000] L2C-310 errata 588369 769419 enabled
[    0.000000] L2C-310 full line of zeros enabled for Cortex-A9
[    0.000000] L2C-310 cache controller enabled, 8 ways, 1024 kB

With this patch, I make it all the way to userspace. I have a Debian Wheezy
armel image which seems happy on the board so far.

So FWIW:
