OK, I hadn't heard that - it's good that folks made their mind up.

Given that a meaningful name was already specified for the handle it's
really not going to help anything - it's just going to duplicate that
most likely.  Given that it can't be actually used for anything it seems
better to just let people write whatever they feel like in there (even
if it's just a single letter to keep the parser happy) rather than
nitpick over their choices.

Really it looks like one of those silly things standards makers do where
they start specifying a feature (in this case device classes) but don't
define any useful behaviour for it.
