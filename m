I dont follow, isnt phy-cells a standard binding, what documentation is 
required?

Kishon, I did use the same names on purpose. The phy-names are actually 
irrelevant because I used the new api I created 
devm_of_phy_get_by_index. I actually wasnt sure if  should take out the 
phy-name field altogether or leave it as phy-names = "usb" for 
compatibility with other bindings. What are your thoughts?
