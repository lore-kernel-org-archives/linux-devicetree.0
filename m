Did anything ever get merged? Or the whole thing was dropped?

That branch looks like what I want, assuming we could get an agreement
on the binding. It looks like pretty much every SoC has this, and there
isn't any API or binding for it that I've seen. The only thing I see is
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/eeprom.txt and that doesn't cover the
client aspect at all.

Taking a quick peek at the code, it might be better to change the read
API to take a buffer and length, so that the caller doesn't need to free
the data allocated by the eeprom layer. It also makes it symmetrical
with the write API. We'd probably also need to make it work really early
for SoC's like Tegra where we want to read the SoC revision early. So
probably split off the device registration part to a later time to allow
register() to be called early.
