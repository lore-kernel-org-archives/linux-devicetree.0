I've had a look at my X-Gene board, and noticed the following thing:

Mustang# md.l 0x78020000 0x10
78020000: 000001e7 00000080 00000002 000003ff    ................
78020010: 00000000 000000ff 000003ff 00000003    ................
78020020: 000003ff 00000000 000003ff 00000000    ................
78020030: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000    ................
Mustang# md.l 0x7802f000 0x10
7802f000: 000001e7 00000080 00000002 000003ff    ................
7802f010: 00000000 000000ff 000003ff 00000003    ................
7802f020: 000003ff 00000000 000003ff 00000000    ................
7802f030: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000    ................

Notice a pattern? Yes, X-Gene is aliasing the GICC region over the 64k
page, repeated 16 times, as it should.

So either the DT is fixed to show GICC and GICV at offset 0xf000 (and we
don't support 64k pages with it), or we extend the binding to present an
offset inside the 128K region.

My preference goes of course to the latter, because for once we seem to
have something designed as expected.

Rob, what do you think?
