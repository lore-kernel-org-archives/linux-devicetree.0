Hi Nicolas,

Thanks for the comments. I have a question (below).

Thanks for your help,

I'm probably not understanding something here. When I look at the code
prior to my patch, it looks like lr is not initialized by head.S. It
also looks like this code makes use of lr when it relocates the code and
leaves it uninitialized when it jumps back to 'restart'.

Is this a bug in the previous code too?

What should lr be initialized to, or should we just be preserving it's
value?

I saw the comment about the performance is different with this patch -
something about a pause between 'Uncompressing Linux...' and the kernel
boot output. I'm not sure what's going on here. By the time
'Uncompressing Linux...' comes out all relocations and dtb discovery is
complete. Do you really think having lr uninitialized would cause this?
