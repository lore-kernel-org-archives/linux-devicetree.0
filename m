FKAN: are you asking for documentation? I don't see alot of example of
support for these.

FKAN: Thats a good idea. But the hardware in this case (SCU) system
clock unit has a bunch of registers used for different functions. If syscon is
used alot in this case and we pile more attribute into it. It would get kinda
messy after a while.

FKAN: I still haven't figured out how to generically tie to
the reset handler? Maybe the next person can use #define to bridge in the
reset handler they want to use.
