So basically you are making sure that they think they decision to reinvent 
the wheel by using proprietary FEX was correct and our decision to use 
generic, extensive and standard-based DeviceTree was self-oriented.

In addition you are telling them something completely opposite from how 
the Linux kernel community (and probably any other open source community 
works). This is _THEIR_ responsibility to consult things they do with us, 
_NOT_ the other way around, if they want to work with upstream.

 - joining the mailing lists by Allwinner people to remove any messengers 
from the way (don't say here that they don't speak English, as several 
people clearly confirmed that they do...)

 - adjusting their workflow to comply with rules of Linux kernel open 
source community (i.e. sending RFCs, getting code reviewed, addressing 
comments)

 - reworking existing code to use widely-accepted, standard solutions 
available in upstream Linux kernel (although this is already mostly done 
by sunxi community)

By the way, I haven't seen any explanation from you who (and by what 
means) gave you any authorization to speak on behalf of Allwinner or to 
represent Linux kernel community for them.

Seeing from your posts you don't have any knowledge on how Linux kernel 
development works and even on how Allwinner's cooperation with our 
community looks (and seem to be completely closed to our effort of showing 
you the reality), so I'm not sure if you are the right person to take any 
of those roles...

I'd suggest Maxime Ripard or someone else from Free Electrons to be 
responsible for communication with Allwinner instead.

Tomasz
