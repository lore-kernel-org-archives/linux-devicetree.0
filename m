I agree with this. The number of bits and offsets is too large to keep
it in DT properties, without running into backwards compat issues later
on.

No, the alias is a arbitrary number that can change from board to
board. It can, but doesn't need to, correspond to any real hardware ID.
If we need a hardware controller ID, then there is no way around adding
a property to the PCIe controller node for this.
