Sorry ;-)

There are many Linux-specific details in Linux's implementation of Open
Firmware Device Trees. Right now, thanks to Linux, Open-Firmware device trees
are used for much more hardware platforms than just Oracle hardware that
probably isn't manufactured anymore and IBM Power servers. For embedded
systems for example, DT's have been used on all PowerPC platforms and is being
introduced in arch/arm right now. On all these platforms, its sole existence
is purely for running Linux with minimal board support code in the kernel.
So, why not add a few more Linux-specific bits to it, if it helps get rid of
the last bit of board-specific code?
The platforms that will use those bindings, will never have
Open-Firmware bioses in the first place, and their DT sources will be part of
the kernel source tree anyway.

I was being careful.

Seems reasonable, but is correct autodiscovery really possible for all
configurations and all DAI-codec combinations?
