So, taken all together, your argument is:

- We want a user partition
- It's okay to destroy the data in the user's partition by moving it
  around randomly between kernel versions.

The two do not naturally go together at all.  You're messing with user
expectations in ways you should not be.  This really is not an acceptable
approach.
