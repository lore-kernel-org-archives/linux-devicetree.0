I see your point. My final concern here is that with device we got
entries in sysfs and uevents that could be used to automatically start
the correct supplicant. Different drivers are likely to require
different supplicants. Starting the correct supplicant based on uevents
is a quite elegant solution which I'm not sure how to support when
skipping devices. Perhaps I could create an object below
<sysfs>/firmware/tee ?

UUID and version of the message protocol is required by ARM SMC Calling
Convention. It will be there anyway so we could just as well check it in
the probe function to catch eventual mismatches in configuration. Since
we're using capabilities to manage extensions of the protocol I think
the minor version could be ignored by probe.
