I don't recall seeing any documentation about the secondary-boot-reg
property. Please make sure it is documented in the next patch series.

Do you have any devices where the enable-method and secondary-boot-reg
isn't the same across all CPUs? A lot of the complexity comes from
broken DTs that don't specify a secondary-boot-reg along with the
enable-method. From the description and the code it seems that we should
just always put these two properties in the cpus node to make things
simple and precise. I agree it's a minor duplication to read the DT
again to get the /cpus node and read a property out of it, but I doubt
you could even measure the difference.

Yes it wouldn't be possible to specify the entry address in DT (depends
on compile time factors). How is this different from cpu-release-addr
though? It looks like it describes something similar to what ePAPR
describes and how arm64 uses it (although those two slightly differ).
Assuming it's paired with a different enable-method than spin-table I
don't see a problem reusing the same name.

This was my train of thought. It annoys me that we have smp ops at two
levels. We already have SMP ops that deal with SMP things and now we
have another level that is associated with the enable-method. If we
really need this callback why couldn't we just collapse it with the
smp_ops we already have? When we do that we realize that
smp_prepare_cpus() is a fairly similar place to do this sort of thing,
but changing that callback to take the node is annoying to propagate to
all users. But do we really need that node? It seems simple enough to
just get the cpus node and then read out the property we care about and
we can do all that in smp_prepare_cpus() one time (and keep the mapping
around forever) without requiring any core ARM changes.

Do you have any more complicated use cases for this setup hook? RIght
now I'm not convinced that we need to add all this framework for
something that looks like it could be done in a couple lines in the
prepare_cpus() step.

	cpus = of_find_node_by_path("/cpus")
	ret = of_property_read_u32(cpus, "secondary-boot-reg", &addr);
