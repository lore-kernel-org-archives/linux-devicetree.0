Okay, that sounds good, I'll add it to my todo list.
I seem to remember some legacy driver relying on one of these mapping (cpufreq
for pxa relying on memory controller maybe ...), but that's a fix easy enough to
queue. Let's hope I'm not bitten by something else.

Okay, I'll verify that, especially that the ordering is ensured, ie. that
interrupts are available at the same time that when it was the machine code
calling the irq init, and that's also going to my todo list.

I think most of the required stuff is already done. The only remaining part is
the reset status clearing specific to pxa, which as you said would ask for a
very tiny driver.

As soon as I'm done with the ac97 rework and if no v4l2 pressure is applied to
pxa, I'll work on this and the MMP to pinctrl conversion.

Thanks for the comments, and cheers.
