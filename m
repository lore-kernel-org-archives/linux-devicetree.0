Normally the direction is implied by dmaengine_slave_config().
Note that neither the dma slave API nor the generic DT binding
can actually support device-to-device transfers, since this
normally implies using two dma-request lines rather than one.

There might be a case where the direction is required in order
to allocate a channel, because the engine has specialized channels
per direction, and might connect any of them to any dma request
line. This does not seem to be the case for "bam", because
the DMA specifier already contains a specific channel number, not
a request line or slave ID number.
