Agreed on all points and well summarized.
I would like to highlight (3) and (4) as it needs to be well understood.

"nohlt" has a *different* meaning already, so using that in this
driver for something else is simple wrong as it affects the system in
unintended ways. And yes if user (mis)uses it to get things working,
it's fine but shouldn't be recommended way.
