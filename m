Hi Ray,

Thanks for submitting the patch. It was nice meeting you at ELC as well.

This binding doesn't conform to the norms for clock bindings. It looks
like for each type of controllable clock node (e.g. pll, leaf clock,
etc) you have a dts node. Looking at the above example it seems that
those two nodes (genpll and genpll_clks) share the same register.

/me checks patch #5

Yup, you re-use the same register address for the *pll and *pll_clks
nodes. I'm not a DT expert but I think this is considered Wrong.

More generally your clock dt binding should be modeling the hardware in
terms of IP blocks. If you have a clock generator IP block it may
control many clock bits and output many clock signals. E.g. for your
hardware (based only on the addresses in patch #5 and not having seen
any data manual) I will hazard a guess that the genpll, lcpll and asiu
clocks are all part of the same IP block.

If my guess is correct then these clocks should all be represented by a
single node int DT. Lets say that the clock controller IP block that
manages the genpll, lcpll and asiu clocks (including their child/leaf
clocks) is called "foobar" in your data manual. You should have a dts
node with a compatible string such as "brcm,cygnus-foobar" or
"brcm,cygnus-foobar-clk".

Your clock driver should be responsible for registering all of the
clocks controlled by this IP block, regardless of the "type" of clock
node.

I think part of the reason for your approach is that the previous
(deprecated) binding/dts had a bunch of fixed-rate clocks in it. This is
a hack that we do every now and then to get a new platform up and
running with a mainline kernel, but we don't do per-clock nodes in dts
any more, we do them by clock controller ip block instead.

There are plenty of good examples of this for Exynos and QCOM SoCs if
you want an example.

Regards,
Mike
