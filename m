Another team will do the job, I can not give my estimation now.

Yes, ATF.

I think cpu hotplug can test it.

So, just booting one core may be the right choice now, right?

I understand your worry and will find the max offset of those clocks
under this controller.

There is no big difference between pm_ctrl and other controller,  they
are all designed as
the base address to control some functions of other modules (certainly
include some clock gates).

Maybe only one node is enough, not one node plus one sub-node ?
