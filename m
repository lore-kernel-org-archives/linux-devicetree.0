Erm, I think it was on Cc (devicetree-discuss@lists.ozlabs.org yeh?)

Oh, I wasn't aware of that limitation.

The SoC I'm working with has some registers full of clock enable bits (I
guess one could have a gate array component with up to 32 clock inputs
and outputs) and some registers full of clock mux switch bits (that
would get really messy to define as a block since each bit switches
between 2 parents, and some of the parents are other clock muxes in the
same block). Some registers contain a bunch of low power related bits
together, including clock enable bits in the same register as various
pinconf settings which is used by a separate pinctrl driver.

Cheers
