Great!

I used the existing documentation and the code as a guide in
crafting the text of those descriptions.  Some of them I had
to speculate though--especially for ARM64 (for which there is
documentation but nothing in the tree that uses it).  So it
needs some informed feedback.

We have no need for anything other than SMP startup at this point
on this platform.  If the framework were there for me to use I
would have used it.

Thanks again for working through this with me.
