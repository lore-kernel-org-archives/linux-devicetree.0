I tried to bring up exactly this issue, but I don't think I got my point
across
effectively.  (probably because I started off with "why the hell does
this exist???")
(face palm)  The amba_bus driver really deals with a bunch of issues
that
are specific to a very small number of platforms and the style of cores
from ARM.

Same here.  I don't know what the right solution for it is, but I find
amba_bus
solution to get in the way more than help.  I had to hack the etm/etb
driver
and the amba_bus to shreds to get it to work for me at all.
I think most of what amba_bus does could be better handled by:
1) generic support in platform bus for clock enabling/power domains.
These are system concerns that most drivers shouldn't really know/care
about, and
will likely vary between SOCs.
2) helper functions for drivers for primecell devices that does the
peripheral id checking.

I realize that this is to some extent, jumping to a solution (which got
me into trouble
the first time around), but if someone has a better suggestion for a
better way to do it,
then I'm all ears.
