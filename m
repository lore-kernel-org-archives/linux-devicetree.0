I guess that'd do the trick for us:
- we could use devm_reset_control_get_optional_shared() during probe
- power_on would then call reset_control_reset()
- the code in reset_control_reset would be changed: the if
(WARN_ON(rstc->shared)) would be removed. then we return 0 if
(rstc->shared && atomic_read(&rstc->shared_triggered)). otherwise we
proceed with the old logic, except that we use
atomic_set(&rstc->shared_triggerred, 1) in case of success (if an
error was returned we leave it as "not triggered").

Let me know if you want me to (at least try to) implement that and send an RFC.
