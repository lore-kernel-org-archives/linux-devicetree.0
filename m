Ok, I'll do a v2 with the custom OPPs dropped, but before I do that
lets get agreement on what to do with the i2c / spi pins on the
gpio header.

I'm not aware of such a policy and I actually believe that the policy
sofar has been to go with the function as which the pins are marked
in vendor documentation.

Looking at just SBC-s we're enabling at least 1 extra (unused other
then for a header) i2c controller on:

arch/arm/boot/dts/sun4i-a10-cubieboard.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun4i-a10-itead-iteaduino-plus.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun4i-a10-marsboard.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun4i-a10-olinuxino-lime.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun5i-a10s-olinuxino-micro.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun5i-a13-olinuxino-micro.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun5i-a13-olinuxino.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-bananapi.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-bananapro.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-cubieboard2.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-cubietruck.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-olinuxino-lime.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-olinuxino-lime2.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-olinuxino-micro.dts

And spi on:

arch/arm/boot/dts/sun4i-a10-cubieboard.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun4i-a10-itead-iteaduino-plus.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun4i-a10-marsboard.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-bananapi.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-bananapro.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/sun7i-a20-olinuxino-micro.dts

And note how the official documentation labels
the pins as sda / scl resp. miso/mosi:

http://www.bananapi.com/index.php/component/content/article?id=24

(you need to scroll down a bit)

As said this board is using the same header as found
on the banana pi and for the pi we are configuring
these pins as i2c / spi and looking at how I see
people use the raspberry pi at my local hackerspace
this is also what people want most of the time.

Hans
