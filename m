I think this should go into bindings/net instead of bindings/soc, since it's
mostly about networking rather than a specific detail of managing the SoC
itself.

That doesn't belong into the binding. Say what the hardware can do here,
not what a specific implementation of the driver does at this moment.
The binding should be written in an OS independent way after all.

You mean 'four interrupts', not 'four cells' -- each interrupt specifier
already consists of at least two cells (one for the phandle to the
irqchip, plus one or more cells to describe that interrupt).

Same here and in the rest.
