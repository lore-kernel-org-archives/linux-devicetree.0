When turning off TDM, will the set_tdm_slot function ever get
called? (Since the TDM was turned off the slots don't need to
be set.) Also, for this device TDM mode is automatically
selected based on the presence of a TDM clock, so there is
nothing to do to switch into or out of TDM mode. Similar
parts handle this the same way, such as: tlv320aic3x.c,
tas2552.c, tas5720.c, ssm4567.c

These conditions happened on the previous shutdown/reset
of the device. We are letting the user know about them, but
they are not critical to the current device state, so I have left
them as warnings.

Since this function is called every 200ms, if an issue comes
and goes, last_warn will be cleared during the next function
call after the issue ends; the function regmap_read will read
in a 0 for that flag's bit, and that new reg value will be saved.
Therefore, the user will be warned only once if the issue is
persistent, but rewarned if the issues leaves and comes
back, so I do not think clearing after a delay is necessary.

This is a single codec device, does it make sense to leave the
device running without its codec? Other single codec devices
initialize regulators in codec probe similarly.

Acked.

Unfortunately, the device runs diagnostics at this point,
which take upwards of 480ms.

What do you mean by this comment? The control register is
set to STATE_MUTE and STATE_HIZ depending on what the
device needs for the new BIAS level.
