Per the above, that does appear to be the case.

I assume that for devices with 0 in this register we do not produce a
warning. So where do we check the interrupt pin register, and when does
this happen relative to of_irq_parse_pci such that we do not produce
that warning?

I als assume that all instances of these particular devices broken in
this regard? If so, I think we need to identify them by Device ID and
Vendor ID, and treat them as if the interrupt pin register read as
zero, in the place we normally check the interrupt pin register.

Note that this is completely independent of the RID/BDF, so the
interrupt-*-mask approach is insufficient.

I'm not entirely sure, but I thought we handled the PCI I/O space as an
MMIO region on ARM64. Do you have many devices/functions attached? It
may be that our VA carveout of 16M is too small.

This is probably worth a separate thread.

This is very fragile, as it depends on the RIDs/addresses assigned by
the host controller. If devices are plugged into different slots then
that could change, you get the warning, and other devices may be
prevented from using wired interrupts.

As I mentioned above, I think we need to identify the buggy devices by
ID, rather than by topology.

Thanks,
Mark.
