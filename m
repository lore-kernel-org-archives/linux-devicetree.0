The same check shows up in numerous other drivers, including the one
for the audio controller on my board.

AFAICT, implementing the set_sysclk callback is mandatory, even if it
is a no-op on the codec side.  If I delete the stub function, audio
playback fails.

The default master volume setting on the TAS5717/5719 is 0x3ff (bits
9:0).  We only ever update bits 9:1 when the volume changes, because
the driver is only able to work with 0.25 dB resolution rather than
the hardware's native 0.125 dB resolution.  So this register write
sets the master volume to an even number, which we know we can handle.

Clearing just the LSB would accomplish the same thing, but would be
less obvious IMO.  It would also require an extra read, and the code
is less concise.

Is there a better way to handle this situation?
