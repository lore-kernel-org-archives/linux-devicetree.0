Jason, Ezequiel, Arnd,

sorry to kick into this thread that late but Ezequiel made me think of
address windows when asking on IRC. From what I can see from your and
Arnd's proposal the only real difference is that having it Arnd's way
allows you to have two or more windows mapped to e.g. devbus with
totally independent address ranges - while yours requires one large
window for all child devices?

Given the limited number of windows, I personally prefer your proposal
above - but nevertheless I can also think of separating target id from
ranges completely. (I know this discussion has been here for a while,
and I apologize if below was already NACKed before)

Although, not thought to the bare end this could also work and maybe
reflects the actual hardware more accuate:

mbus {
	compatible = "marvell,kirkwood-mbus";
	ranges; /* 1:1 mapping */

	internal-regs {
		ranges = <0 0xf1000000 0x800000>;
		/* target-id target-attr size */
		marvell,mbus-target = <0xff 0x12 0x800000>;

		nand {
			compatible = "marvell,orion-nand";
			reg = <0x10400 0x80>;
			marvell,mbus-target = <0x01 0x2f 0x100000>;

			/* in board dts */
			spansion-flash {
				...
			};
		};
	};

	sram {
		marvell,mbus-target = <...>;
	};
};

When removing size from marvell,mbus-target above, mbus driver could
also probe for required max size from the reg properties of the child
nodes. Arnd already said that mbus isn't "simple-bus" anymore, why
can't it just walk through the nodes and collect required windows?
