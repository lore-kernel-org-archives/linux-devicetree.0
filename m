For gpiolib I was trying to say that it would match what we did
for ARCH_QCOM on arm32. The same is true for COMMON_CLK_QCOM.

We don't select these configs because they aren't required to
boot into a ramdisk that contains the clock driver and gpiolib
framework plus whatever disk driver and filesystem we may need to
access the (presumably) much larger disk that contains the rest
of the modules.
