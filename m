Gentlemen reminder for this patch set. We would appreciate to have your
feedback on iec helper.
>From our point of view it could be useful to have a generic management
of the iec controls based on helpers instead of redefining them in DAIs.
Having the same behavior for these controls could be useful to ensure
coherence of the control management used by application (for instance
Gstreamer uses it to determine iec raw mode capability for iec61937 streams)


Thanks,
Arnaud
