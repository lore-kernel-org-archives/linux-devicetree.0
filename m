Then its gets enabled when the regulator loads, so assuming that the usb driver
is enabled in the kernel config 0.5 (built-in) - 3 (module) seconds earlier then
it otherwise would.

This is not a problem since usb-ports are normally always powered anyways, the only
reason they can be turned off on embedded systems like sunxi is for powersaving
during suspend (which actually goes against the usb spec, but usually works so
most tablets / laptops do this).

Hans
