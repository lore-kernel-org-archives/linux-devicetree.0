It looks like you forgot to CC the clock subsystem maintainers:

M:      Mike Turquette <mturquette@linaro.org>
M:      Stephen Boyd <sboyd@codeaurora.org>

The description above sounds like a neat solution, but has the
disadvantage that the clocks without a client won't show up in debugfs.
I wonder if the clock maintainers know of a better way?

Shouldn't this replace the old legacy code in clk-bcm2835.c?

I wonder if a separate Kconfig symbol is warranted for the clock driver.
Looking at the context in the patch, it's common not to do that though.

Why not just use the raw HW IDs (from the mailbox protocol) as the ID in
DT and the driver? The only thing that would need to change is to add a
error check for "clkspec->args[0] == 0" in
rpi_firmware_delayed_get_clk(). The advantage would be that
include/dt-bindings/clk/raspberrypi.h would exactly match the firmware
protocol, and hence be easily correlated with the documentation.

The docs indicate there's a third word here "skip setting turbo". Is
that optional?

Hmm. I wonder if that will confuse things; I thought the purpose of
round_rate() was so code could know exactly what would happen ahead of time?

I would move all that into this driver's probe().

Is it possible to add clock parent information to the driver, so the
clocks are all hooked together into the correct tree, rather than all
looking like root clocks?

One of the many reasons I didn't do anything FW-wise for the kernel was
the hope that such information would be forthcoming, and hence we could
have complete kernel drivers.

Oh, that's nasty. What would it take to fix the clock core to support
deferred probe? It really should.

Oh, I guess the same comment as for the firmware node applies re: the
over-genericity of the DT compatible value applies here too. Perhaps
raspberrypi,bcm2835-firmware-clocks to match Lee's proposal for the
firmware node?
