I stated that poorly.  It was intended conceptually, not literally.

One possible concrete implementation would be to use something other
than DTC_FLAGS, for example DTC_FLAGS_EXTRA, then have the build
system choose whether to fold DTC_FLAGS_EXTRA into DTC_FLAGS, based
on some sort of configurable value.
