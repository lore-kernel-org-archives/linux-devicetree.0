Where is this described? From the commit text that introduces
IORESOURCE_REG I see:

"Currently a bunch of I2C/SPI MFD drivers are using IORESOURCE_IO for
register address ranges. Since this causes some confusion due to the
primary use of this resource type for PCI/ISA I/O ports create a new
resource type IORESOURCE_REG."

And the comment next to the #define says "Register offsets". I don't see
anywhere where it mentions these are CPU addresses. Certainly the
current IORESOURCE_REG users aren't CPU addresses because they're
SPI/I2C device drivers.
