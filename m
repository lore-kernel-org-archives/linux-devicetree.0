APB is an AMBA bus, so this part is accurate.  The block diagram of
the SoC has the UARTs (and other perpherials) hanging off of the APB
bus.  So, this organization follows the block diagram.  While the
UART drivers are not AMBA aware, there appears to be no issues with
this layout (as the HW/drivers come up without issue).  Unless there
is an unforeseen issue with having non-AMBA aware devices on the DT
AMBA bus, I would think it best to organize it to match the block
disgram.

This is all that is currently needed.  I was planning on expanding it
as I added more devices.
