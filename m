Strange. Why do the even have names in there? What are those strings?

I noticed that ux500 has uses four different strings, one for each
instance, which is obviously a bug and should just be fixed. There is
no way this was intentional, and we can just rely on teh fallback
if you want to have that anyway.

Sorry, I don't understand the question.
