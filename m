If the firmware file is going to depend on the DT, then you might as 
well just put the data into the DT.

There's a similar issue on QCom Dragonboards. The WiFi (and BT?) 
firmware files are supposedly board specific, so folks don't want to put 
them into linux-firmware. But it also seems to be unknown as to which 
parts are board specific are not.
