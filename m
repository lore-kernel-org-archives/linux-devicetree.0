I can use device name here. However, the perf event names will be
different between DT and ACPI which I want to avoid.
And the names don't look good at all.
Also, specifically for MC and MCB PMUs, the indexes are compared
against the active MC/MCB mask to find out whether they are populated
or not.
Without using the index property, I will also need a mapping function
of physical device addresses and their physical ids.
