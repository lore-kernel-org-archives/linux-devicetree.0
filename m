This should have been in the binding description also.

The layout of the ARM ARM can change over time, so please refer to the
full document number, which can be found at the bottom of each page
(e.g. ARM DDI 0487A.j).

I would generally expect that the secure world would lock down
debugging, as this poses a security risk.

I take it that this is only unlocked on development firmware.

Given that cores can be powered down outside of our control, I'm not
sure that accesses to these registers is safe in general.

How does this interact with an external debugger making use of these
registers?

A per-cpu variable is preferred to an NR_CPUS sized array.

I do not believe this barrier is correct.

Per ARM DDI 0487A.k_iss10775, H9.2.32, "EDPCSR, External Debug Program
Counter Sample Register":

        Implemented only if the OPTIONAL PC Sample-based Profiling
        Extension is implemented.

So even if we have access to an MMIO debug interface, we cannot
necessarily acecess this register.

Is there no potential for deadlock with a CPU reading its own debug
interface registers?

The DT binding said nothing about Cortex-A53.

How variable are the MMIO registers in practice? Do we need to know the
particular CPU?
