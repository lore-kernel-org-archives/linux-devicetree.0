When user bindings told to setup chaining intermediate MDMA transfers are always
triggers.
For instance if a user requests a Dev2Mem transfer with chaining. From client
pov this is still a prep_slave_sg. Internally DMAv2 is setup in cyclic mode (in
double buffer mode indeed => 2 buffer of PAGE_SIZE/2) and destination is SDRAM.
DMAv2 will flip/flop on those 2 buffers.
At the same time DMAv2 driver prepares a MDMA SG that will fetch data from those
2 buffers in SDRAM and fills final destination memory.

Ok. I will to think about it how to proceed.
