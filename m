Well, looks we have been inconsistent here:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/amd/amd-seattle-soc.dtsi-           reg = <0x0
0xe1110000 0 0x1000>,
arch/arm64/boot/dts/amd/amd-seattle-soc.dtsi-                 <0x0
0xe112f000 0 0x2000>,
arch/arm64/boot/dts/amd/amd-seattle-soc.dtsi-                 <0x0
0xe1140000 0 0x10000>,
arch/arm64/boot/dts/amd/amd-seattle-soc.dtsi-                 <0x0
0xe1160000 0 0x10000>;

arch/arm64/boot/dts/arm/juno.dts-               reg = <0x0 0x2c010000 0 0x1000>,
arch/arm64/boot/dts/arm/juno.dts-                     <0x0 0x2c02f000 0 0x2000>,
arch/arm64/boot/dts/arm/juno.dts-                     <0x0 0x2c04f000 0 0x2000>,
arch/arm64/boot/dts/arm/juno.dts-                     <0x0 0x2c06f000 0 0x2000>;

If we are going to use 64K sizes, can we have some consistency here
please. Which ranges really need 64KB sizes? It should only be the
VCPU interface. right? Why does XGene need 128K? If XGene is doing
address swizzling, then the CPU and VCPU base addresses are wrong.
Seattle is also wrong for the VCPU, but no one has noticed because we
don't use the DIR register IIRC.

XGene should also add an "arm,gic-400" compatible string or something
XGene specific if in fact it is not GIC-400.

I think perhaps we need a specific compatible property to indicate a
GIC-400 with address swizzling. While we could get away with using the
aliased addresses, that seems to be hard to get right and we may
regret not doing it in the long term. It would indicate at least it is
64K page safe for example.
