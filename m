That is a bug in the ethernet driver, and we should not merge such code.

Please fix those drivers before submitting them, so they don't rely on
additional interfaces beyond what the DMA engine API provides.

If you need something that the common interface is missing, you can
send a patch to extend the dmaengine core driver, but more likely it
already does what you need and you are just not using it right.
