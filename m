Hi Neil,

Yes, exactly. It assured that 0..0x01000000 was always unavailable, as
intended, but at the same time it ignored any lowered or heightened
upper limit coming from the bootloader side.

As a rule of thumb, any nodes that have device_type set can be expected
to be modified during boot.

Thanks, its binary is called stress-ng in openSUSE Tumbleweed. ;)

I'll happily test once HDMI is ready. :)

Confirming no issues on three runs on meson-gxm-rbox-pro:

Yes, sounds fine to me, thanks. I'll note a few more nits to consider.

Kevin, I noticed that this supposedly applied patch did not show up in
linux-next for testing - could you merge your fixes branch into for-next
please for those of us working on new stuff?

I guess it would then be best to consider splitting this patch up per
board/SoC so that you can set appropriate Fixes: headers indicating how
far back each one needs to be fixed.

Andreas
