Basically, the same RTC that was used in SuperH devices is now used in
RZ/A1 devices. Therefore with some slight changes, that driver can be
reused.

Additionally, since ARM architectures require Device Tree configurations,
device tree support has been added.

This was tested on RZ/A1H RSK board. Once the correct time was programmed
into the RTC running off a 32.768kHz crystal, you can retain an accurate
system clock between reboots (hard and soft) until power is finally removed
from the board (there is no batter backup on the RSK board).

v3:
* remove 'power-domains' from example in documentation
* update commit message subject and body of dt-bindings

v2:
* removed HAVE_CLK from Kconfig
* when using DT, look for "fck" instead of "rtc0"
* changed (res == NULL) to (!res)
* added Reviewed-by for rtc-sh.c
* added interrupt-names and clock-names
* clocks now include counting sources
* added clock-names "fck", "rtc_x1", "rtc_x3", "extal"
* changed 'is a RTC' to 'is an RTC' in commit message
* changed "rtc0" to "rtc"
* Added clock nodes for RTC_X1 and RTC_X3 pin inputs
* each commit now has a log message
