I will add another patch to my set to correct this.

Thanks - I will add this to my patchset.

I can clean up all but ARCH_BCM_MOBILE_L2_CACHE.  This one is 
intertwined with SMC support and it looks like they want the option to 
turn on and off this feature.  This L2/Trustzone support will need to be 
cleaned up at a later time.  I heard Russell King says the PL310 cache 
code will be changing again soon.  When I add PL310 Trustzone support 
for the Cygnus SoC I can have a look at cleaning it up for the 
Mobile/Kona base SoCs at the same time.
