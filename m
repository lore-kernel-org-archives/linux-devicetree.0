Stephen specifically didn't like the chip ones due to churn.  We'd
have to add compat tags every time we got a new chip.... which is kind
of frequent.  So I opted for defining one compat for older A family
chips that require only 1 clock.  The qcom,scm would cover the newer
chips.

And it looks like i left a reference to apq8064.  That needs to be
replaced with a-family.  Sorry for that confusion.

Andy
