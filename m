Hi,

Thank you for some comments and pointing out.

I think it's more generic to define simple-reset with parent clock/reset
control without both SoC and device names.

However, such parent clocks/resets strongly depends on SoC, 
so I think it's difficut to lead generic definition in this case.

If we add generic compatible string, I also add "simple-reset".

Surely, it might be hard to understand that pro4-glue-reset is SoC-specific
but for generic-device.

Adding "glue-reset" is usable for devices having same parent clocks/resets as
usb3/ahci, and we can add the devices without patches.

However, if the device needs other parent clocks/resets for the same SoC,
we can't add "glue-reset" and we might add patches for the device as a result.
In this case, the "glue-reset" will become difficult to understand.

Since it's hard to lead the best result,
currently I'd like to suggest the current compatibles, with "simple-reset"
if necessary.

Thank you,
