In this case, that's certainly not an excuse unless you are worried about
400 bytes of .rodata in one driver and there are no side-effects of having
the device ID listed when it's not used. Even if it made a real difference
to another project, you'd need a much better excuse -- if you are worried
about compatibility between mainline and some downstream kernel, how about
changing that downstream kernel to use DT?

The dma_get_any_slave_channel() change is probably my fault. I suggested
both the initial dma_get_slave_channel() API and this one because the
original approach turned out too complicated. If dma_set_mask_and_coherent().

I don't think you have to merge other trees, to get both APIs, they should
already be part of the dma-slave tree that your patch would get merged
into. If not, we can probably come up with a different solution. The
dma_set_mask_and_coherent() suggestion is not as important as the
dma_get_any_slave_channel() one, if you have to choose between them.

The code I quoted is right after these lines:

+       /* Request DMA channel mask from device tree */
+       if (of_property_read_u32(pdev->dev.of_node,
+                       "brcm,dma-channel-mask",
+                       &chans_available)) {
+               dev_err(&pdev->dev, "Failed to get channel mask\n");
+               rc = -EINVAL;
+               goto err_no_dma;
+       }

If DT is disabled or not used, you return -EINVAL here.
