BTW, if you want to change the SCR.NS bit (and CNTVOFF), the kernel must
run in Monitor mode (by setting the CPSR mode bits, 32-bit only).

I think the context was slightly different. As I re-read the thread, it
seems that the discussion was around whether to use some SMC interface
or not based on whether the kernel is running secure or non-secure. The
argument made by Will was to actually specify the type of the firmware
SMC interface in the DT and use it in the kernel (and probably assume
the kernel is running in secure mode if no smc interface is specified in
the DT; you could have both though, running in secure mode and also
having firmware).

In this arch timer case, we need to work around a firmware bug (or
feature as 32-bit ARM kernels never required CNTVOFF initialisation by
firmware, no matter how small such firmware is). We don't expect a
specific SMC call to initialise CNTVOFF, so we can't describe it in the
DT.

One problem with undef for detecting whether the core is in secure or
non-secure mode is that sometimes the initialisation code needs to run
very early when the kernel hooks may not be fully initialised. We could
only detect this mode on the booting CPU and save it in a global
variable (of course, assuming the other CPUs boot in the same mode).
Other code could make use of such information as appropriate. Of course,
there is always a risk that it will be abused.
