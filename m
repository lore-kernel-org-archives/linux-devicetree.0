In case it's still relevant. The ICU has a limitation where the entire unit can be either secured or non-secured.
If the entire ICU is secured, It's practically useless in Linux. In the non-secure setup, Linux can technically modify configurations made by secure FW.
This means the secure FW can't reliably use the ICU for secure interrupts.
This limitation should be fixed in future revisions to allow secure FW to use the ICU for generating secure interrupts.
