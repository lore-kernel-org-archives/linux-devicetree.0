Right. I'll fix the document.

Hmmm, I did this by following brcm,bcm11351-pinctrl.txt:
- function: String. Specifies the pin mux selection. Values must be one
of: "alt1", "alt2", "alt3", "alt4"

But you are right, in the pinctrl binding document it describes the
generic pin multiplexing nodes use "function" and "group".

Let me try to explain how the Cygnus pinctrl controller works and maybe
you can help to comment whether or not it's suitable for what's
described in pinctrl-binding.txt for the usage of "function" and "group=
".

The Cygnus pinctrl contoller has a limitation that the mux configuratio=
n
can only be group based. "group" here is a real configuration in the
Cygnus pinctrl controller registers. One can configure a "group" to
alternate function 1, 2, 3, or 4.

=46or example, the group "lcd" covers 30 pins. When I configure "lcd" t=
o
alternate function 1, all 30 pins are muxed to LCD function. When
configured to function 2, all pins are muxed to SRAM function. Now, her=
e
comes the issue, when configured to function 3, pins 1-15 and 20-30
become GPIO function, but pins 16-19 becomes SPI5 function. When it's
configured to function 4, all 30 pins become GPIO.

In some other cases, when I configure a group to other functions, there
could be spare pins which become unused (not brought out to the pad).
Or, the spare pins may also become a separate function.

Based on the LCD example, I'd assume I would do the following for the
default LCD function:

lcd_node {
	group =3D "lcd_grp";
	function =3D "lcd";
};

And in the case of function 3, I would call the function "spi5" and
assume the rest of pins become either GPIO (or unused)?

spi5_node {
	group =3D "lcd_grp";
	function =3D "spi5";
};
