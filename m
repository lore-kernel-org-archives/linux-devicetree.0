Cool, thanks! This driver will be one of the early adopters :-)

A bit of mumbling to myself below:

Hmm, upon further reflection, walking the list of ccu clocks is rather
identical to walking the list of each clock type, as I do in the gxbb
driver, where ccu_common is the one and only clock type.

So that in itself is not a big deal and isn't a problem that needs
solving.

What needs solving is a way to populate base addresses for each clock at
runtime in a way that does not *force* you to invent something like
ccu_common if you do not need it.

You would hit this issue if you broke your common gate or divider clocks
out and did not wrap them in the ccu_common structure. I solved this by
overloading the ->reg value of each of the common types as static data,
and then did the following when registering them:

	/* Populate base address for gates */
	for (i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE(gxbb_clk_gates); i++)
		gxbb_clk_gates[i]->reg = clk_base +
			(u64)gxbb_clk_gates[i]->reg;

Any thoughts on how to fix this for other common gate types that need
their base addresses populated from an OF node at runtime?

But also not a big deal if you hide clocks from your DT ABI. You can
store NR_CLKS in kernel code, and never expose it to the DT ABI.

"the list of clocks to register" and "the clk_hw_onecell_data to deal
with the dt binding" are the same array.

You only need two arrays:

1) the ccu_common init data
2) the clk_hw_onecell_data array of clk_hw pointers that points to
clk_hw statically defined in the ccu_common array

And then only expose the clocks that you want via the shared header in
the DT include chroot. See:

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/clk/linux.git/diff/drivers/clk/meson/gxbb.h?h=clk-s905&id=738f66d3211d7ae0cd0012ba6457dac9a03bfd6b

https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/clk/linux.git/diff/include/dt-bindings/clock/gxbb-clkc.h?h=clk-s905&id=738f66d3211d7ae0cd0012ba6457dac9a03bfd6b

In summary, there is only one array of "clocks to be registered", and we
limit DT exposure via the shared header. Again, your choice to expose
whatever you want via DT, but I thought I'd explain my approach
(especially b/c the SoC I'm hacking on has incomplete docs).
