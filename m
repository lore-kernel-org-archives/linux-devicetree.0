A couple of quick rebuttals, but I imagine we're going to disagree on
the platform_driver thing as a matter of taste no matter what...

1) There should be multiple clk drivers in a properly modeled system.
Some folks still incorrectly put all clocks in a system into a single
driver because That's How We Used To Do It, and some systems (simpler
ones) really only have a single clock generator IP block.

Excepting those two reasons above, we really should have separate
drivers for clocks controlled by the PMIC, for the (one or more) clock
generator blocks inside of the AP/SoC, and then even more for the
drivers that map to IP blocks that have their own clock gens.

Good examples of the latter are display controllers that generate their
own PLL and pixel clock. Or MMC controllers that have a
runtime-programmable clock divider. Examples of these are merged into
mainline.

2) Stephen and I wanted clock drivers to actually be represented in the
driver model. There were these gigantic clock drivers that exclusively
used CLK_OF_DECLARE and they just sort of floated out there in the
ether... no representation in sysfs, no struct device to map onto a
clock controller struct, etc.

I'd be happy to hear why you think that platform_driver is a bad fit for
a device driver that generally manages memory-mapped system resources
that are part of the system glue and not really tied to a specific bus.
Sounds like a good fit to me.

If platform_driver doesn't handle the early boot thing well, that tells
me that we have a problem to solve in platform_driver, not in the clk
subsystem or drivers.

3) Lots of clock controllers should be loadable modules. E.g. i2c clock
expanders, potentially external PMIC-related drivers, external audio
codecs, etc.

Again, repeating my point #1 above, just because many platforms have a
monolithic clock driver does not mean that this is the Right Way to do
it.

Best regards,
Mike
