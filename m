One example is how all the drivers that use the generic dmaengine code
instantiate their DMA drivers, or how all the drivers for CODECs that
have both I2C and SPIi control interfaces instantiate - given that the
device specific code here seems to be mostly data tables that's probably
the closest thing.

My main concern here is to make sure that when you decide you need to
use the more complex hardware that this can be done without too much
pain to existing machines (and that they can benefit from as much of the
enhanced functionality as is possible).
