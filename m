I think the sub-node style above it nicer because it allows referencing
the individual clocks outputs with a phandle. We use this chip to
generate base-frequencies for audio clocks, and so we have to switch
between two freqs for the multiples of 22.5KHz and 24KHz at runtime.

The 3 clkout model is the only one I have access to as well.

That's great. Let me know if you want me to test anything.
