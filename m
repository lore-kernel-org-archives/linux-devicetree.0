Yes, I am - partly because I don't know what to do with many of the
patches I seem to be endlessly carrying (which depresses me).  I look
back to the days when I could be sure of completely emptying my tree
at each merge window, something which /never/ happens anymore.

As you may have seen, I've mailed out the licensing patch, and I've
also mailed out two patches - one for PWM stuff and the second one
being the RTC change broken out from my sgtl5000 hacks patch.

I've also cut a v4.0-rc1 patch set, in the usual diff.bz2, tar.bz2,
and separate patch forms which include those three patches.

RTC is the easiest bit of the problem, as you've discovered it's just
a matter of uncommenting the bit in DT.  (It's even better if you have
a battery to plug into the little connector!)

Audio needs more than just DT changes, and there's recently been some
SGTL5000 patches submitted which change the way power is controlled
in the SGTL5000.  I don't yet know whether those patches solve the
problems I was seeing with the kernel powering down the SGTL5000's
internal regulator, thereby making the device totally inaccessible
until the next power cycle or not.

Whether I'll get a chance to look at that this week or not, I don't
know... (see my privately shared G+ status from yesterday, which
people in my G+ circles should be able to see.)
