I think the main advantage of tying this to a PCIe endpoint driver
is that this would give us a logical object in the kernel that we
can add the user space interface to, and have the protocol on
top of it be portable between different SoCs.

32-bit ARM SoCs can be built with a 64-bit dma_addr_t. Would that
help you here?

Simplicity is important indeed, but we have to weigh it against
having a consistent interface. What the dmaengine driver would
give us in combination with the PCIe endpoint driver is that it abstracts
the hardware from the protocol on top, which could then be done
in a way that is not specific to an AST2xxx chip.

I don't think that replacing the ioctl() with a write() call specifically
would make much of a difference here. The question I'd like to
discuss further is what high-level user space interface you actually
need in order to implement what kind of functionality. We can then
look at whether this interface can be implemented on top of a
PCIe endpoint and a dmaengine driver in a portable way. If all
of those are true, then I'd definitely go with the modular approach
of having two standard drivers for the PCIe endpoint (should be
a trivial wrapper) and the dma engine (not trivial, but there are
many examples), plus a generic front-end in
drivers/pci/endpoint/functions/.
