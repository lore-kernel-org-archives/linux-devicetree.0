No it is not, in this case we also want to be able to specify
different fw names on devices using the same base dts, here
is a tablet for all the q8 tablets with gsl1680 I've:

I'm working on a q8hardware-mgr (inspired by the beagle bone cape mgr)
to automatically detect the touchscreen controller as well as the controller id
(the 2nd column above), and it will need to set a filename for the firmware
file based on this, deriving this from the machine compatible will
simply not work here.

Hans
