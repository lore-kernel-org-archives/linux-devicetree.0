Which audio controller?  There may be several CPU side audio interfaces
in the same card.  For example people often want to have both low
latency and high latency audio paths from the CPU into the hardware (low
latency tends to increase power burn).  SoC centric system designs do
sometimes also have PDM I/O, expecting to be directly connected to DMICs
and so on, which results in a relatively large number of CPU interfaces.

Please do try to understand the idea of representing simple components
on the board and analogue interconects between devices - it's really
important and not something that can be neglected.

That DT binding was done entirely in the context of video applications
IIRC, this is the first time it's been discussed in this context.
