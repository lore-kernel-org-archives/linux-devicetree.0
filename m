Correct. Parameters are probably different, but it is internal to your =
driver so
you can do whatever you want there.

How did that work with my v9 patchset? How does it work for other MSI-a=
ware platforms?
Are they not using pci_scan_child_bus()?

Bjorn can comment here, but there seems to be a long standing desire to=
 make
pci_scan_root_bus() more useful. If your change is generic enough, how =
about proposing
a patch for pci_scan_root_bus() and see what feedback you get.

Judging by the complete silence I'm getting on my change (patch 9/10) o=
f the same function,
we might be lucky enough and no one will notice ;) (Bjorn, I'm kidding =
and I know you
are busy).

Best regards,
Liviu
