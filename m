Our internal MIPI DSI SoC owner gave me some feedbacks on the clock sources.
According to him, the Synopsys DesignWare MIPI DSI host controller needs four
clock sources from an application platform - pclk, refclk, cfg_clk and dpipclk.
These clocks are mentioned in the "DesignWare Cores MIPI DSI Host Controller
Databook, 1.01a1.30a.pdf" documentation.

Quote some words from the documentation:
pclk    - APB clock signal.
refclk  - D-PHY reference clock used for Master-side serial clock generation in
          clock multiplying unit(PLL).
cfg_clk - D-PHY Configuration clock used for the initialization of the PHY. It
          is also used for exiting ULPS state.
dpipclk - Input Pixel clock signal.

The below table reflects how does i.MX6Q/DL provide the pclk, refclk and cfg_clk
for the DesignWare MIPI DSI host controller, according to the SoC owner.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Synopsys      |                     i.MX6Q/DL MIPI DSI                     |
| DesignWare    |------------------------------------------------------------|
| documentation |    clock   |     clock root     |       CCM_CCGR bits      |

|    refclk     | pll_refclk | video_27m_clk_root | mipi_core_cfg_clk_enable |
|---------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
|    cfg_clk    |   cfg_clk  | video_27m_clk_root | mipi_core_cfg_clk_enable |
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think we should add a new clock "IMX6QDL_CLK_MIPI_IPG" as a shared clock gate
clock.  And, the clock-names property should exactly contain "pclk", "refclk"
and "cfg_clk", right?

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Yes, the "ips_clk" clock is the "pclk" clock.  The "ac_clk_125m" clock is
designed for test and should not be used by software development, according to
the SoC owner.
