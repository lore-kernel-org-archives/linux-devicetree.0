The clock is stuck at around 2 volts until the first clk_disable.
When the clock is disabled it drops to GND. Future clk_enables make the
clock come at the reported frequency.

As for the clock being initialized incorrectly, I selectively added
mdelay(100) at each dev_dbg with debugging disabled until the 
initialization came up correct.

I found that adding a delay at the end of si5351_msynth_round_rate
appears to be magically fixing the incorrect frequency settings.
Not sure if this sheds any light on the issue but I figured I would 
share this information.
