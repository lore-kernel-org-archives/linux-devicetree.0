I guess they're there as spacers to allow the AMBA bus code to get the
right clock when it calls clk_get(&pcdev->dev, "apb_pclk").  Everyone
seems to have worked around the binding rather than reporting the issue
or fixing it.

>From a quick grep, for pl022's SSPCLK we currently have the strings:

* ssp{0,1}clk
* spi_clk
* spi{0,1,2,3}clk

Though I may have missed a string or two where nodes get amended in more
specific files. A grep for apb_clk to find neighbours didn't highlight
any obvious ones.

Sure, I'll fix those up once we have a preferred name. I guess this
would be SSPCLK by Russell's comments, I wasn't able to find a prior use
in the git history, but it would be in keeping with KMIREFCLK as used by
the pl050 driver.

Given the general policy of trying to not break support for existing
DTBs we'll need some fallback, either using the first clock or getting
the driver to try the names above.

I thought one of the issues before dt was that clocks were in a global
namespace. Mark's reply implies that's not necessarily the case, so I'll
take a tour through clkdev to educate myself.

Cheers,
Mark.
