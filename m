Perhaps I am misunderstanding the nature of the .dts files, but I'm
puzzled about the dbg_clk. I cannot see anything in the architecture
or normal A53 implementation that mentions this.
To access external debug from the core/external debug agent then we do
need the APB clock, but the interface between the debug logic and the
processor core is clocked by the internal CPU clocks.

When I was looking at clocks for trace on the HiKey board I noted:
HI6220_CS_DAPB -- which I assumed was the debug APB clock.
HI6220_CS_ATB - which I assumed was the ATB (trace bus) clock.
