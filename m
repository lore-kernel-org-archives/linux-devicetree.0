Or 44k1, just something that works with internal dco. kirkwood-i2s
should request 256*fs, or 11289600 Hz for 44k1 audio rate from external
clock.

So you are actually testing 44k1 in any case. Let's stick with 44k1 for
now.

Ok, but 44k1 works with HDMI, we try to reproduce 44k1 with external
clock now.

Ok.

Can you add "usleep_range(10000, 12000);" after clk_set_rate(extclk) in
kirkwood-i2s. That should be enough to get around any issues with
external clock not being stable. I will look up real requirements for
si5351 later (and actually this should move to clk-si5351.c later too).

Please make sure, you stick with 44k1 (or something that works with
DCO).
