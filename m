Clocks are normally disabled during suspend.  When clocks are disabled
they give up their reference.  If references reach 0, the clock is
gated.  If one of these clocks is gated, the system will never come
out of suspend.

How is it a bug?

You can say that about any framework.  It's our responsibility to ask
the right questions and to disallow it from being abused.  The clocks
I use in the (real-world) example in this set are _really_ always-on.
If any of them are turned off the system will cease to perform in any
meaningful way.

The point of this is that even when these clocks are claimed, there is
an issue that when unclaimed (i.e. during suspend) the clk framework
will attempt to gate them, and when they do *boom*.

This has nothing to do with the initial state of the clock.  It's
whether the clock is integral (i.e. is part of a vital interconnect)
that's important.  For instance, ST's bootloader turns on lots of
clocks which can be safely gated if unused.  The clocks we're
registering with this always-on framework cannot.

I'm not sure I understand your point.  The current policy is correct
if it's power that you care about, which is invariably the point of
disabling clocks in the first place, right?  Also, this has nothing to
do with DT per say.  It's just another framework driver.
