Sorry for that. Liviu is on holidays, he usually reviews Juno DTS change
and provides ack. But missed to check with him before he disappeared.

We(me along with Liviu and Lorenzo) will try to group them together and
one of us can send you pull request.

I don't think there's any other fixes on the list though there are few
feature additions which I assume is too late for v4.5 now. But still I
prefer to wait till next week so that I can check with Liviu to see if
there are any other Juno fixes that can be grouped.
