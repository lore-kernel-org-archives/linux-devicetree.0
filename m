I'm not entirely clear, is the DT intended to replace the command line
for saying things like "console=XXX"?

Real example: I have a device where the bootloader decides which
serial port will be the diagnostic boot console, if any, based on a
specially wired serial cable detected at boot time, and it passes the
decision to the kernel.

In that case, does the console selection need to be easily accessible
to that early asm code, for early printks?
