4 means there are >= 4 empty slots in the FIFO, so there are no more
than 11 remaining data. This makes sense.

IIRC, the Freescale official BSP release for i.MX is used to set 6 to
TFWM0/1 in the old day, not sure about recent ones though. So I think
setting 4 to TFWM0/1 should work for most of cases. We may also let
others test it before merging it.

Actually a setting of 13 is much more risky in my opinion. It means
only two empty slots in the FIFO, so it might be easily to get under/
overflow if a DMA transaction gets delay somehow. The only benefit is
that DMA requests and interrupt (FIQ) can be reduced.
