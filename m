Sure, thanks for such a quick response and resolution :)

Indeed.

Yes Juno is almost 4 years old now, so it may not be too good a
reference platform for latest and greatest platforms like hikey2 ;)
As I said, Juno predates the recommendation in the PSCI spec.

Yes, I don't see any reason not to, as this may become reference to some
other platform, it's good to keep it aligned so that copy paste happens
in a good sense for future platforms. :)

OK

I would wait until ATF changes are merged before you patch DT in the kernel.
