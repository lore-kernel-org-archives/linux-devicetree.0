Well, I wouldn't be so certain about that statement. As I wrote in the
cover letter, most of the work is actually done, and I successfully
tested the new DMA support with a some of the drivers I ported. Others
were ported blindly, and in case of no reaction, I'd dare to merge them
and wait for people to report back in case of trouble.

The only real problem is the PXA camera driver, which does tricky things
like hot re-queuing of DMA descriptors. That one needs fixing before the
series can land.

That would cause tree-wide cross-dependencies between drivers, because
the two DMA controllers can't be used at the same time, and the PXA
specific API will be unavailable when the mmp-dma driver is selected. My
patch series (and the DMA controller framework for that matter) aims for
the opposite - the unification of APIs and drivers.

Well, given the feedback I got for the series so far, I fear we'll be
off to maintain two drivers for each peripheral for a very long time.

I'd rather propose cracking the last nut that's left, and then get the
thing merged.

Arnd, Haojian? Any opinion here?
