The fact that we disable some clocks at init time is a driver model
thing that depends on various factors (e.g. cmdline options), and it's
something that could be moved around. We only mention disabling, and not
rate change (which could happen, even if it doesn't today).

I don't think that we need to describe the Linux behaviour at all.

Something like:

- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs 
  Clocks described by this property are reserved for use by Xen, and the
  OS must not alter their state any way, such as disabling or gating a
  clock, or modifying its rate. Ensuring this may impose constraints on
  parent clocks or other resources used by the clock tree.

  Note: this property is used to proxy clocks for devices Xen has taken
  ownership of, such as UARTs, for which the associated clock
  controller(s) remain under the control of Dom0.

My point of contention here is that while this might tell a dts author
what to place in this property, it doesn't specify what the OS should
do.

Thanks,
Mark.
