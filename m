I think I understand that syscon is different (doesn't probe triggered
by its compatible string). And in this case it's the responsibility of
the "consuming" driver to ensure the DT semantics (see below).

I understand that, but the consuming driver currently follows the
semantics: I checks for a regmap offered by a proper device first, so
anything offered by a non-syscon driver. Then it only reverts to the
syscon method otherwise - to keep backwards compatibility.

OK, that seems to be true. ioremap doesn't seem to check for existing
users at all (that' probably due to the "re" in its name). But I don't
think the matters here:
- Either the kernel has support for the proper driver - then the device
should always get the regmap from there and will never try syscon.
- If the kernel does not have this driver, syscon will do the trick.
Without any proper driver there is also no concurrent user of the area
covered by syscon.
- If there is a consuming driver using syscon and another consumer
requiring the specific driver, that should be considered a DT bug. Or we
don't care, if both consumers don't conflict in their MMIO accesses.

So where would be the problem? I don't see a valid case with two
ioremaps on the same region.
I don't think we need to care about anyone adding a random syscon user
to the DT, which conflicts with the SRAM driver. This would be just wrong.

Cheers,
Andre.
