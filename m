Yea, what it means is I've no possibility to go back to what was
originally working now, since I don't understand how to get UEFI to
behave (Will set the machine up for me, I don't have any information
on how it was originally configured other than what was on the uSD
card, which appears incomplete.)

I've tried that, it still stops at the same point, after:

FV2 Hob           0xFE07B000 - 0xFE8253BF

and remains unresponsive.

I do notice that the uSD card becomes visible through USB at this point
though.

Okay, well, I'm going to have to disable Juno from the nightly boots
until we get some kind of resolution on this, as my Juno is now
incapable of booting anything.
