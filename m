According to ARMv8 architecture reference manual (ARM DDI 0487A.k)
Chapter 'Part H: External debug', the CPU can integrate debug module
and it can support self-hosted debug and external debug. Especially
for supporting self-hosted debug, this means the program can access
the debug module from mmio region; and usually the mmio region is
integrated with coresight.

So add document for binding debug component, includes binding to two
clocks, one is apb clock for bus and another is debug clock for debug
module self; and also need specify the CPU node which the debug module
is dedicated to specific CPU.

+* CoreSight Debug Component:
+
+CoreSight debug component are compliant with the ARMv8 architecture reference
+manual (ARM DDI 0487A.k) Chapter 'Part H: External debug'. The external debug
+module is mainly used for two modes: self-hosted debug and external debug, and
+it can be accessed from mmio region from Coresight and eventually the debug
+module connects with CPU for debugging. And the debug module provides
+sample-based profiling extension, which can be used to sample CPU program
+counter, secure state and exception level, etc; usually every CPU has one
+dedicated debug module to be connected.
+
+Required properties:
+
+- compatible : should be
+	     * "arm,coresight-debug", "arm,primecell"; supplemented with
+	       "arm,primecell" as driver is using the AMBA bus interface.
+
+- reg : physical base address and length of the register set.
+
+- clocks : the clocks associated to this component.
+
+- clock-names : the name of the clocks referenced by the code. Since we are
+                using the AMBA framework, the name of the clock providing
+		the interconnect should be "apb_pclk", and the debug module
+		has an additional clock "dbg_clk", which is used to provide
+		clock for debug module itself. Both clocks are mandatory.
+
+- cpu : the cpu phandle the debug module is affined to. When omitted
+	the source is considered to belong to CPU0.
+
+Example:
+
+	debug@f6590000 {
+		compatible = "arm,coresight-debug","arm,primecell";
+		reg = <0 0xf6590000 0 0x1000>;
+		clocks = <&sys_ctrl HI6220_CS_ATB>, <&acpu_ctrl HI6220_ACPU_DBG_CLK0>;
+		clock-names = "apb_pclk", "dbg_clk";
+		cpu = <&cpu0>;
+	};
