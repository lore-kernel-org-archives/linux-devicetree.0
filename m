I believe so.

I see these bindings as simply providing the data to populate the same
pinmux mapping table that's currently used by the pinctrl subsystem.
therefore, there are no changes to the operation of the pinctrl subsystem
(beyond a little extra code to parse the map from DT instead of receiving
a static table from a board file), and no changes to the way drivers
use the pinctrl APIs. Hence, all that error-checking will still operate
as-is.

Yes, the pinctrl/pinctrl-names properties allow defining a set of names
states, just like the mapping table does, and a driver can get one,
release it, then get a different named state, etc.
