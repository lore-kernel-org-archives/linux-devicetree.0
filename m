Hi all

-This patch serie hasn't goal to create a platform with
asymmetric linux processor (like vf610).

-Today, STM32 family have several boards with mcu microcontroler
Cortex-M like stm32f429, stm32f746...
And this patch serie prepare new board with support of Cortex-A
instead-of Cortex-M. (that's all)
