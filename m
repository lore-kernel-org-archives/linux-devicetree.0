This patchset updates the ARM DTS for the Oxnas platform by :
- Add support for the Oxford Semicondutor OX820 and the PogoPlug V3
- Update the OX810SE to use the dt-bindings includes files introduced in [1] and [2]
- Fix the MAINTAINERS entry and add the PogoPlug V3 file maintainance

This patchset depends on dt-bindings include headers posted at [1] and [2],
that were accepted/merged in the subsystem trees.

How could I manage this dependency for 4.10 ?
