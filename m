Even per board is a very surprising amount of variability TBH. =20

The thing that's surprising me here is that there's even a board to
board variance that's so bad that it needs to be configured like this -
usually these things are just hard coded into the driver so they work
for everyone rather than needing per-board tuning.  It seems entirely
possible that the formula quoted in the datasheet is just nonsense in
general and that the driver would be better off using your number for
all systems for example.  If we do have to hard code something in the DT
it seems better to hard code something that is at least coming from a
spec rather than a measured number that needs to come from an average
over a batch of boards since at least we can revise how we handle the
number without needing to do something that shows up in the ABI.

That's actually something I want to avoid since the delays tend to need
to come in the middle of write sequences which makes a general property
a lot more complicated, and obviously some devices have multiple delays
too.
