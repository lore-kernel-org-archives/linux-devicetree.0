IMO yes.

I did briefly looked at NVME before renaming the eeprom to nvmem,
NVME is aimed at defining the command/feature set for PCIe-based SSDs 
with the goals of increased and efficient performance and interoperability.

This patch-set introduces simple nvmem which is applicable for non 
volatile memories like efuses, eeprom, ROM, NVRAM .. etc, which are used 
in most boards/SBC's. Data like calibration table, mac address or opps, 
are generally stored this. This data is required by multiple drivers and 
currently there is no framework in the kernel to address/abstract this, 
resulting in code duplication.
