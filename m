While the DT spec says 31 characters, this has never been enforced. As
you might guess, we have node names longer than 31 characters. There's
been some discussion about what to do and the consensus seems to be
change the spec.

Yes, I wrote that before looking at how you were using it... Of
course, if you want efficient, then you shouldn't use sprintf either
and use of_node_name_eq() as I've suggested.

Generally, I would agree that's a worthwhile goal. However, in this
case you aren't saving anything. We still have at least a DT version
of the same thing (of_get_child_by_name). Maybe there's some dream
that the fwnode API will become the only one for both drivers and
non-drivers, but I really don't see that happening. As long as both DT
and fwnode APIs are in use, it is best to keep the APIs aligned.

There's another aspect that the node name comparison is case
insensitive on powerpc (and until 4.20, was for everything but Sparc).
I changed it in 4.20 and hopefully don't have to revert. Patch 4 does
a case sensitive compare. That probably is fine (as lots of powerpc
code already does case sensitive name compares), but no one really
knows until we break users.

Another issue is how are disabled nodes dealt with by different
firmwares? It's a frequent bug that we don't honor the 'status'
property (such as in the very code we're discussing). But then there
are some cases were want to ignore it so we can't just go add that
check in and we end up needing 2 flavors of everything. You're
probably okay though. Most devices with child nodes are
enabled/disabled only in the parent device node.
