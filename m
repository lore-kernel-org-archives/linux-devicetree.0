Meanwhile, the FSF appears to disagree, so this creates work for
solicitors (or lawyers if you're in the US) to have a field day.

Also, if it was _this_ easy, we would have included a web URL to
point at the license text since 1992 - but we haven't because it's
a level of indirection that brings with it uncertainty.

Now, you could say "oh we worship the LF, we trust them, they're
never going to do anything stupid, let's trust SPDX to always
stay the same and exist" but IMHO that's letting emotional
judgement cloud the legal issue.

There's also very little discussion on spdx.org about the legal
side of this stuff.

So, to me, this spdx stuff looks like a programmers solution to a
legal problem, looks completely untested legally, and goes against
recommended practices (which are to include the copyright plus the
actual notice of intent - not copyright plus a level of indirection.)

As I said above, if it was this easy, we'd have been linking to
(eg) fsf.org's copies of license texts for years or similar.

Now, with the FSF.org's different stance on X11 vs MIT compared
to spdx.org identifying "MIT" differently, I suspect that there
is ample room here for solicitors/lawyers to make a great deal
of cash.

Another point here is... if LF and/or SPDX.org goes belly-up, or
becomes unaccessible, eg, spdx.org's name registration expires and
gets taken over by a rogue party - at that point, this SPDX stuff
can mean _anything_.

I do hope those who you've been recommending to use SPDX tags stop
and think about it, and don't blindly follow what you're suggesting.
