Yes, this is a problem in some cases, and that should be considered in
those cases. There are always shades of grey.

Per the above, that isn't relevant in this case. This is a pretty
black-and-white stand against the usual rules.

Submitting prototypes and RFCs is the usual way we get things reviewed
early, and to allow maintainers and others to get a feel for things
earlier. Submitting patches _for merging_ when you're not sure about
things and don't want to agree to support them is what's being pushed
back on.

As what I said was evidently ambiguous, I'm on about code being _merged_
prior to being ready. Code and bindings should certainly be posted for
review as soon as possible. However, it should be recognised when things
aren't quite ready for mainline.

Even if something's unclear about a device, you can highlight more
general issues (e.g. problematic edge cases in common subsystem code),
and that's possible to have merged even if the binding isn't ready.

If you're unsure about something, but still want it merged, then you
have to commit to maintaining that as far as reasonably possible, even
if it turns out to not be quite right.

As times have changed, pain points have moved around.

To some extent that is unavoidable; more up-front effort is required
where crutches we previously relied on are not applicable.

Elsewhere we can certainly do better.

Throwing your hands up and stating "this is unstable, it might change"
is a crutch. It prevents any real solution to the pain points you
encounter, and creates pain points for others. It only provides the
_illusion_ of support.

Deliberately violating the rules and then complaining that the rules
don't work because you don't care for them is a terrible argument.

Thanks,
Mark.
