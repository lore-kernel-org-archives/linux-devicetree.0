Is there some kind of copyright assignment on file or something?  It's
weird to have someone else without obvious authorship own the
copyright...

Please just license the file under the GPL, all the drivers that get
built from here are GPLed - I can't see any reason for this to have an
odd license.

I'd expect this to be the first thing in the file not the last.  Why are
things in here bools, shouldn't they be tristates?

This appears to be CPU drivers as well as sound cards (as you'd expect
for machine drivers) so the comment isn't quite right - just remove it.
