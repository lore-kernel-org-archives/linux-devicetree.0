Agreed, and I too have similar experience. This is exact reason why I am
urging for threaded irq, unless we have real requirement for hard irq.

I have not yet tried yet. For sure secure access will explode.

It's quite similar to your one expect few comments which I have made.
Here is the public version of Juno spec[1]. Not sure if it covers MHU in
detail.

Yes I am not arguing on that, it should assume atomic and not sleep.
I am saying we can avoid rx_callback in interrupt context if possible.
I will try to look at the protocol implementation tomorrow.

As I said its almost same as this, except I call mbox_chan_received_data
in irq thread context. I prefer enabling other interrupts while copying
payload data.

No I didn't intend for any mailbox API to account it.
