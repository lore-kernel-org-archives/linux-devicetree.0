I think you're confused there...

$ ls -1 Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/bcm/
brcm,bcm2835-vchiq.txt
raspberrypi,bcm2835-power.txt

Doesn't look like SoC/board bindings to me...

whereas:

$ ls -1 Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/bcm/
brcm,bcm11351-cpu-method.txt
brcm,bcm11351.txt
brcm,bcm21664.txt
brcm,bcm23550-cpu-method.txt
brcm,bcm23550.txt
brcm,bcm2835.txt
brcm,bcm4708.txt
brcm,bcm63138.txt
brcm,brcmstb.txt
brcm,cygnus.txt
brcm,hr2.txt
brcm,ns2.txt
brcm,nsp-cpu-method.txt
brcm,nsp.txt
brcm,stingray.txt
brcm,vulcan-soc.txt
raspberrypi,bcm2835-firmware.txt

does fit with your description, except for the directory path...
