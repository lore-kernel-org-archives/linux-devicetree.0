ok, numa-node-id makes more appropriate.

thanks, we can have compatible string, which helps in future expansions.

it might be trivial to mention this explicitly, however definitely
2 node numa system is not trivial!!

lesser the distance value indicates less inter node access latency.
for cpu present in node A to access memory of node B, the latency
would be 1(less latency)
for other-way scenario, it is 255(more latency)

i am not sure how the system behaves with asymmetric distance, however
function sched_init_numa tries to assess that the distance are symmetric or not
and for asymmetric, it prints warning.
