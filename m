There is a sequential grouping of ECC registers containing IP specific 
ECC enable and ECC error injection bits. A number of these registers 
have the same bit definitions but a few such as L2 cache are different.

If I understand your question, I'd characterize these as various small 
EDAC blocks that happen to be close to each other in the MMIO space.

There is no master - these IP memories are meant to be individually enabled.

If you are saying that I place the base address in the parent and then 
just include the offset from the parent registers [0 for L2 cache and 4 
for OCRAM] in each child then I'll need to research how to do that. I 
think our clock manager may do this.

The interface is similar but the bit definitions for ECC Enable and bit 
injection are different between these two IPs. However, these 
differences are taken care of with different const data structures in 
altera_edac.c.

You're suggesting a phandle to the L2 cache similar to the phandle the 
OCRAM uses? The probe function would then grab the appropriate const 
data structure based on where the phandle pointed, correct?

I will do that. Thanks for reviewing.
