Sorry for not being clear, so the services like AFE, ASM, ADM have 
different version numbers for a given SoC/firmware.

Not 100% sure if firmware updates would change the service version 
number, even if it does, it can be queried dynamically on new B family 
SoCs, and on older A Family SoCs I have not seen the firmware updates in 
last 4 years.

Yes, Plan is that it will be part of the compatible string in cases 
where version query is not supported on older QCOM A family SoCs.
On B Family SoCs we can query the version dynamically.

So we will have 2 cell values, one representing the apr service and 
other the dai.

Yes, I will give that a go.

So we will endup having something like this in DT for one frontend and 
backend dailink:

apr {
	compatible = "qcom,apr-v2";
	qcom,smd-channels = "apr_audio_svc";
	qcom,apr-dest-domain-id = <APR_DOMAIN_ADSP>

	q6audio: audiosvc {
		compatible = "qcom,q6audio-svc";
		qcom,apr-svcs = <APR_SVC_CORE APR_SVC_AFE APR_SVC_ASM>;
		qcom,apr-svc-names = "CORE", "AFE", "ASM";
	};

	sndcard {
		compatible = "qcom,msm8996-snd-card"
		qcom,model = "DB820c";
		qcom,audio-routing =
                 	"RX_BIAS", "MCLK";
		fe@1 {
                 	is-fe;
                         link-name = "MultiMedia1";
                         cpu {
                         	sound-dai = <&q6audio  APR_SVC_ASM MM1>	
			};
                         platform {
                         	sound-dai = <&q6audio APR_SVC_ASM MM1>;
                         };
                  };

		be@1 {
                 	link-name = "HDMI Playback";
			cpu {
                         	sound-dai = <&q6audio APR_SVC_AFE HDMI>;
                         };

                         platform {
	                        sound-dai = <&q6audio ARP_SVC_ADM>;
                         };

                         codec {
                         	sound-dai = <&hdmi 0>;
			};
             	};
	};
};
