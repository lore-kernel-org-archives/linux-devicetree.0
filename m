The example I gave above concerns Global Platform like TEEs, we're
trying to cover TEEs that doesn't follow Global Platform also here. Most
(or at least a significant part) deployed TEEs, in terms of volume,
today are not Global Platform compliant.

I'd like to view TEE_IOC_CMD as communication channel directly into the
TEE. What goes inside the channel is not something that this subsystem
cares about. The kernel driver will likely need to translate memory
references from user space inside this channel to something usable by
secure world (and vice versa), but apart from that it does as little as
possible except delivering messages.

There's no single definition of what interfaces a TEE has to normal
world. As soon as we try to define a common interface we're bound to
either miss a function completely or just define something that can't be
used by some TEE.

Global Platform has "TEE Client specification" and "TEE Internal Core
API Specification", but neither says anything about what happens between
the lower layers in user space and the TEE.

Yes, but that's driver specific. Some TEEs don't have this and the rest
does it in their own way. Global Platform doesn't say anything at all
about this.

In secure world there's a trusted OS (the TEE) with possibly embedded
Trusted Applications (TAs). The TEE may support loading TAs dynamically.

In the OP-TEE case when running on ARM with TrustZone it works like this:
1. The TEE is already loaded when kernel boots.
2. A tee_context is created when user space opens /dev/teeX, this
   context holds the sessions.
3. TAs are loaded when needed when a session to the TA is opened.
4. When the context is closed all sessions that are still open are
   closed.
5. What happens with the TAs when sessions are closed is internal to the
   TEE. The TAs are stored in protected memory which the kernel can't
   access any way.

OP-TEE is currently single threaded in the sense that only one thread
can be active in secure world at a time. We have some synchronization
around the SMC that enters secure world, but that's implementation
specific and only there to avoid unnecessary ping pong or spinlock in
secure world.

Correct, except that the firmware (the TEE) is in most cases already
loaded at this stage.

There's two reasons I'm using ioctl instead.
On ARM with TrustZone (common case right now) the TEE is executing on
the same CPUs as the kernel (but with the ns-bit cleared instead of
set). Delivering a message/request is done with an SMC, you can compare
it with a syscall in user space. OP-TEE doesn't have a scheduler instead
we run on the time of the user space process doing the request. If we
where doing read/write/poll in which of the syscalls would we do the
SMC?

We have to be able to run several commands in parallel. How do we
connect the different reads and writes? A separate file descriptor would
do it, but we would need more than one for each session.
