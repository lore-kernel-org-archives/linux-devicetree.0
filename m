So whats the plan now?

I'm feeling likely to revert "dw_apb_timer_of.c: Remove parts that were =

picoxcell-specific" in my tree and leave the rest of the wreckage to the =

arm-soc folks to sort out (either getting the fix in or reverting the =

lot and trying again for 3.12), unless we get some agreed upon path =

forward sorted quickly here.
