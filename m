A vendor can always choose to "add value" in this manner. The general
expectation of *some* driver being upstreamed remains.

You're not changing the code, but you are creating a binding. Bindings
are intended to be stable (i.e. a working DTB from today should continue
to work in future), and thus there are ramifications.

Few devices these says are entirely independent, and most devices can be
instantiated multiple times (even if there happens to only be a single
instance in practice). For the example of a userspace driver there are
very real ABI concerns, such as how the device(s) are discovered, how
any related components like regulators and clocks are controlled, etc.

There are ramifications here, and it's a dangerous over simplification
to say that this doesn't matter because we're not changing kernel code.

That's always the case when a new generation of hardware comes out, so I
don't think that's relevant to the topic at hand.

Writing and reviewing bindings is a very tricky topic, as it can require
fairly intimate knowledge of a piece of hardware. I've repeatedly found
that binding descriptions did not match the realities of the hardware,
and I've only managed to do so by looking at accompanying driver code.

Given that manuals and other information on devices are often not freely
available (if they exist at all), the proposal effectively limits myself
and others to spot common (anti)patterns, which is far less than ideal,
and will result in more mistakes.

As it stands, the proposal asks for effort for the community (in terms
of review and maintenance of bindings), with no benefit to the kernel
community, and a number of pitfalls that we would rather avoid.

In an ideal world, writing and reviewing bindings would be a simple
affair, and this could happen separately from work on any particular OS.
In practice, things are sufficiently complicated that you need *some*
demonstration that a binding is suitable, which is what I'm personally
after when I ask for a Linux driver.

For this discussion to go somewhere, we need an example. Otherwise we're
all coming at this with differing implicit assumptions and no clear
evidence for any assertions.

I do not have an example. I know that others are using DT for data
beyond what Linux or another OS requires, but it's my understanding that
that is typically in a separate DTB.

Thanks,
Mark.
