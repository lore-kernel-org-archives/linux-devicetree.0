Subject: [PATCH v8 0/4] perf: Add APM X-Gene SoC Performance Monitoring Unit driver

In addition to the X-Gene ARM CPU performance monitoring unit (PMU), there
are PMU for the SoC system devices such as L3 cache(s), I/O bridge(s),
memory controller bridges and memory. These PMU devices are loosely
architected to follow the same model as the PMU for ARM cores.

v8:
 * MAINTAINERS: Fix section header in one line
 * Change module_platform_driver to builtin_platform_driver
   Get rid of the use of module.h and its no-ops macros

v7:
 * Remove const from the definition of xgene_pmu_cpumask_attrs
 * Validate the event group as a whole, disallow creating groups containing
   mixed PMUs
 * Implement pmu::pmu_enable() and pmu::pmu_disable() to let the perf core
   starts and stops the counters properly
 * Using list_for_each_entry() instead of list_for_each_entry_safe() to iterate
   over the list of pmu sub-devices
 * Fix resource leak issue in case of registering perf devices fails
 * Pass on returned error if acpi_walk_namespace() fails
 * Remove unused xgene_pmu_data::data
 * Move enable interrupt after probing pmu sub-devices

v6:
 * Add IRQF_NOBALANCING and IRQF_NO_THREAD flags to the PMU overflow interrupt
   Exclude the interrupt from irq balancing and prevent the context from being
   threaded

v5:
 * Remove hw_perf_event::extra_reg field use
   Change GET_CNTR to use hw_perf_event::idx
   Change GET_AGENTID/GET_AGEN1ID to use hw_perf_event::config_base
 * Use compound literal structure defines for format and event attribute groups
   to statically define them at compile time
 * Bitwise invert the meaning of agent mask in config1 field.
 * Fix update pmu_counter_event pointer before starting event
 * Add reset of pmu_dev->pmu_counter_event to NULL in xgene_perf_del
 * Use exactly half of max period to fix the overflow counter issue and account
   for the possiblity of extreme interrupt latency
 * Use spin lock instead of interrupt masking in overflow interrupt handler
 * Remove unnecessary update of hw_perf_event::period_left

v4:
 * Alphabetically sorting header files
 * Remove dynamic allocation for PMU format and event attribute groups
   Create shared constant attribute groups per each class
 * Remove perf_sample_data as this perf driver doesn't support sampling
 * Consistently use the PCP_PMU_V{1,2} defines
 * Set affinity to make sure the overflow interrupt is handled by the
   same assigned CPU

v3:
 * Remove index property use in PMU device sub nodes

v2:
 * Use bitmask for event asignned counter mask pmu_dev->cntr_assign_mask
 * Remove unnecessary spinlocks in perf add/del operations
 * Remove unnecessary condition checks
 * Enforce CPU assignment to one CPU for perf operarations
 * Set the task_ctx_nr to perf_invalid_context for perf driver
 * Remove irrelevant pt_rregs
 * Change perf sysfs attributes to be fixed instead of dynamic
 * Fix checking for an ACPI companion device instead of EFI enable
 * Add documentation for config/config1 fields format and perf tool example
