Um.. no.  It's not more complex at all.  We're talking about this ID
in the dt blob's header, not in the device tree itself.  As I said,
it's one dereference to get to the ID, from the DT address which is
being passed in.  i.e. *one* more instruction than having it passed in
register.

There are two advantages, both small, but contrary to your assertion
it's not significantly more complex, so they don't need to be big.
	1) It means the DT blob contains *all* the information you
need about the machine.  If you have multi-stage bootloaders, you can
copy that blob and know you've got everything.
	2) It means we could have information with a similar purpose
in the same place for both PowerPC and ARM (and maybe others in
future).
