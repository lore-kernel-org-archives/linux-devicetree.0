Isn't it the case that for I2S:

* Word Select (WS) is always required to disambiguate left/right. So WS need
  not be specified in any device tree configuration.

* The audio inputs depend on a particular board but at least one is 
  required.  Fortunately, the TDA998x devices have all the same pin/input
  numbering so they /could/ be described as i2s0, i2s1, i2s2 and i2s3 as 
  per J-F's earlier email.  But tt isn't clear from my reading of the 
  TDA19988 datasheet (for example) whether one can skip channels (so
  does channel 0 always have to be present?).  If the channels must
  be enabled from 0 then one could simply specify the number of inputs.
  (The datasheets that I have don't indicate whether there's any 
  channel remapping performed internally by the TDA998x).

* What the driver does need to take account of is the number of inputs
  that are active so that the sound CODEC can be properly configured.
