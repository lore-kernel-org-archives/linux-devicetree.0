Currently the clocks are configured through clk-exynos-audss.c. The
reparenting of I2S bus clock is not done anymore, but is left to use
the default value set in bootloader. With default setup (XXTI as the
parent), I have tested wave files with various sample rates on Snow.

The missing part right now is setting XCLKOUT (mclk for the audio
codec) properly. In internal tree, I have directly programmed the
XCLKOUT register (we don't have a clock for it as this register is not
part of clock domain). I am now working on preparing a clock provider
for XCLKOUT.

I will do my best to add relevant people in the discussion.

Ok.

Thanks.
