Yes, I have a patch to enable that:
https://github.com/jgunthorpe/linux/commit/da2881f55c094338f3b76617962e6af6c15f9cb9

People didn't like the DT binding, so I'm just sitting on it.

Yes, in most cases platform drivers should not call of functions to get
resources

Almost:
 -> reg 0x8 pf gpio3
 -> range 0 of fpga@0       ==> 0x82000000 0x00000000 0x00000008
 -> range 0 of pcie@1,0     ==> 0x82000000 0x1 8
 -> range 1 of pex@e0000000 ==> MBUS_ID(0x04, 0xe8) 8
 -> range 0 of mbus         ==> 0xe0000008

Each translation represents something concrete:
 0x8 -> 0x82000000 0x00000000 0x00000008
    This is the BAR 0 decoder of the PCI device
 0x82000000 0x00000000 0x00000008 -> 0x82000000 0x1 8
    This is the PCI bridge's memory window decoder
  0x82000000 0x1 8 -> MBUS_ID(0x04, 0xe8) 8
    This is the MBUS window associated with the PEX
 MBUS_ID(0x04, 0xe8) 8 -> 0xe0000008
    This is the physical CPU BUS address associated with the MBUS
    window

The mapping of the FPGA bus into a BAR is done by a single ranges:

That ranges says 'put address 0 of the child bus at 0x82000000
0x00000000 0x00000000', which is the BAR 0 address, relative to the
bridge's memory window.

Since your BAR layout of your device is fixed you can adjust the
single ranges:

  ranges = <0x00000000  0x82000000 0x00000000 0x08000000  0x8000000>;

It is possible as well to do this in code in the FPGA driver.

> How would you also deal with a second (let's say identical) device on BAR1?

  ranges = <0x00000000  0x82000000 0x00000000 0x08000000  0x8000000  //  BAR 0
            0x10000000  0x82000000 0x00000000 0x08000000  0x8000000> // BAR 1

Use reg <0x10000abc xxx> to refer to the 2nd BAR. There are other ways
to organize things.

I'd see it as an interm step, pending on some kind of core support for
this sort of stuff.

Yes, that probably works. My version of the above has an additional
bit of code that I removed which filters the children to
create. Basically FPGA version 1.0 has a different list of devices
than version 1.1, etc.
