Mark,

the mask that is changed in the patch is what will be written
into i2s controller's registers. So, if there is no S/PDIF in that 
specific controller that bit can possibly have a different meaning.
Also, enabling both I2S playback and SPDIF playback can cause the
controller to behave differently.

I share Russell's concern about it and would rather like to use
multiple codecs per DAI (DPCM) for that. I see Daniel Mack picked
that up again, maybe he submits something soon.
