ok, will remove it. Probably it will be better to have it in common
place some where by the Docs?

Why should i invent some thing new, some Docs with suggested names will
be good.

Depends on HW. Even on production system i had cases where i need to
jump in and use some random pin for debugging. So, hawing it in
devicetree can help to reduce time later.

But i would prefer to have some kind of merged names: Names provided by
SoC descriptor (real pin names or locations) and names provided by board
design.

Ok, i will fix it.

Not in:

which was used for this patch.

This was not clear to me, marking GPIO pin as peripheral, at moment of
writing and testing it was a allocated by led driver. Bit for example
IO-GCLK was free to use for GPIO :).. so do [] actually make sense?

there are two names:
SoC name: PWM1
Connector name: IO-GCLK

Which should be used. IMO it was user friendly to use connector name.
