True. As we said, simple mode ha few additional features like write only
And read only dma. So, if user want then here is the provision.

Correct. We are working on slave dma support and will patch to this driver.

In sg case, both source and destination locations need to be configured.
In simple dma and read-only mode, only source address is required. Simple
Dma just read the data from source location and discard that data. It will save
Unnecessary write to destination here.

It's a kind of rate control mechanism. We can aslo use this feature to prioritize other
Channel by deliberately controlling the current channel transfer scheduling.

Depends on the system and how source and destination IPs are interconnected.
Sometimes there is a limitation from interconnection also.
Also some flash controllers providing linear access to NAND or NOR memories may
Have limitation in burst length but still user can use memory copy with desired burst
Length.

By default driver configures the optimized settings and it works with upstream
Dmatest. Even with customized settings it works with dmatest only thing it might
Gain/loss performance but that's up to the configuration user may want.

This dma controller was designed to provide more flexibility to the user by providing
the all possible dma parameters configurable.
