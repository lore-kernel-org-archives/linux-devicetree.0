A phandle in the device tree is the only way I can figure out which I2C bus to use.  But there's another problem.  I can use of_find_i2c_device_by_node() to determine the i2c_client (and therefore, the i2c_adapter) to use for fb_ddc_read().  However, that function only works if the I2C device was probed.  That typically is done by the I2C driver for the device, but there is no "edid" device driver.  So my framebuffer driver is going to have to pretend to be one.

It seems to me that having the framebuffer driver handle the EDID 
"driver" function is exactly the right thing.  The framebuffer driver is 
the only thing that cares about EDID information.  Given a phandle 
reference to an I2C interface, the "driver" is just "call the I2C read 
routine" - plus, in your case, toggling the GPIO pin.

That GPIO pin thing is annoying, but not sufficiently complex or common 
that it warrants having a separate EDID driver.  You could define a 
platform-specific property to tell your framebuffer driver that it needs 
to do that GPIO thing.  It's a hack, but the GPIO thing is inherently a 
hack, so there will be some ugliness somewhere as a result.

Our SOC has four I2C busses, so I don't understand why the board designed didn't dedicate one for the DDC.  But I can easily work around this issue.
