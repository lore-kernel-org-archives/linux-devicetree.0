It is opt-in by subsystem or drivers and mainly intended for
subsystems which can be optional or only support built-in drivers.
However, I don't really envision many other users other than the ones
I converted (pinctrl, iommu, pm-domains). If you look at patch 3,
you'll see it is dependent on !CONFIG_MODULES.

For the timeout, well, that's for debugging only. If you get to the
point of loading sound modules, you probably don't need the timeout.
It's for debugging not booting.
