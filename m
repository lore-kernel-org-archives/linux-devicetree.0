The major part of this patch is the adding of an ALSA platform driver so that
audio comes out of the box in AXS boards but we also added functionalities to
the i2s driver and performed one bug fix related with the mask/unmask of
interrupts. I will split the patches but they will depend on each other.

Your changelog appears to describe the writing of a machine driver but
this is a large patch adding code to an I2S controller driver.  This
means I can't review your patch since I can't tell what it is supposed
to do.  If you've added functionality to this driver you need to send
one or more patches each of which adds a single feature to the driver
together with a changelog which describes what that feature is.

Glancing at the patch I'm not 100% sure that the features you're adding
are part of the Synopsis device but I'm not entirely sure.

No, this doesn't make sense - the fact that someone has used a Synopsis
I2S controller doesn't mean that they have a system which uses
simple-card.  If the user wants to use simple-card they need to enable
it separately, this is the same pattern we follow for all CPU controller
drivers.
