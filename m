Thanks, good catch.

I do agree that 2 different ways to deal with it is not ideal. I also think that
having one hard-coded value (and one alternate for MTK) is also not ideal.

I like where you are going with this. Are you saying that I could read for a
device property read from firmware (for DTB or ACPI) like DWC3 does for
"snps,hird-threshold"? If you mean this, where do you recommend I store the
desired IRQ_CONTROL value - in struct xhci_hcd ?

Or by "compatible" strings, did you mean storing hard-coded values in the
of_device_id usb_xhci_of_match[] array? This would still be hard-coding (which I
would like to avoid) and also would not work for the ACPI case.

Thanks for the feedback Rob.
