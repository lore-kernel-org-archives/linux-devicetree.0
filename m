Hey,

I think this topic has went stale, but I believe I figured out a way to 
work with overlays at the moment.

Basically involves couple of steps:

1) Save the overlay source files under existing file folders, and use 
the same .dts file type for them as for typical DT source files.
2) Use "make DTC_FLAGS=-@ dtbs" to compile everything, or some variant 
of this (if want to compile single file for example.) Basically need to 
add that DTC_FLAGS build flag only.

So, the question is, is this acceptable approach? Can we start posting 
overlay files for upstream to pick up, with the /plugin/ directive 
within the files, and use .dts as their file type?

All the patches I posted so far just attempted to make the system more 
maintainable (read: more readable for human beings, with the .dt*o file 
types, separated folders for the DTC_FLAGS and everything), but it seems 
it should be possible to live without any of that.
