Hi!

I naively thought that since there was support for both nxp,tda19988 (in
the tda998x driver) and the atmel-hlcdc, things would be a smooth ride.
But it wasn't, so I started looking around and realized I had to fix
things.

In v1 and v2 I fixed things by making the atmel-hlcdc driver a master
component, but now in v3 I fix things by making the tda998x driver
a bridge instead. This was after a suggestion from Boris Brezillion
(the atmel-hlcdc maintainer), so there was some risk of bias ... but
after comparing what was needed, I too find the bridge approach better.

In addition to the above, our PCB interface between the SAMA5D3 and the
HDMI encoder is only using 16 bits, and this has to be described
somewhere, or the atmel-hlcdc driver have no chance of selecting the
correct output mode. Since I have similar problems with a ds90c185 lvds
encoder I added patches to override the atmel-hlcdc output format via
DT properties compatible with the media video-interface binding and
things start to play together.

Since this series superseeds the bridge series [1], I have included the
leftover bindings patch for the ti,ds90c185 here.

Anyway, this series solves some real issues for my HW.

Cheers,
Peter

Changes since v2   https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/17/385
- patch 2/7 fixed spelling and added an example
- patch 4/7 parse the DT up front and store the result indexed by encoder
- old patch 5/6 and 6/6 dropped
- patch 5-7/7 are new and makes the tda998x driver a drm_bridge

Changes since v1   https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/9/294
- added reviewed-by from Rob to patch 1/6
- patch 2/6 changed so that the bus format override is in the endpoint
  DT node, and follows the binding of media video-interfaces.
- patch 3/6 is new, it adds drm_of_media_bus_fmt which parses above
  media video-interface binding (partially).
- patch 4/6 now makes use of the above helper (and also fixes problems
  with the 3/5 patch from v1 when no override was specified).
- do not mention unrelated connector display_info details in the cover
  letter and commit messages.
