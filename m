That argument applies always, doesn't it?  There's always a chance that 
you might discover a new quirk in a device for which the DT board file 
has already been written and committed to firmware.  The board file 
could declare that the device is compatible with something older, but 
the new quirk might ruin that compatibility.

Under the circumstances, do we really need a new binding document for 
the ehci-platform driver?  We should be able to use the existing 
usb-ehci binding, perhaps with some new properties added:

	has-synopsys-hc-bug
	no-io-watchdog
	has-tt

We probably can omit has-synopsys-hc-bug, as that is specific to one
type of MIPS ATH79 controller.  The driver can check for it explicitly,
if necessary.

In fact, it's not clear that these new properties need to be added now.  
They can be added over time as needed, as existing drivers are
converted over to DT.  Or is it preferable to document these things
now, preemptively as it were?

The one that matters most and is most clearly a property of the HW is
"has-tt".  IMO it should be added right away, even though there may
already be DT board files that could specify it but don't.  Right now,
for example, the ehci-xilinx-of driver checks instead for the
"support-usb-fs" property, as defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/xilinx.txt.
