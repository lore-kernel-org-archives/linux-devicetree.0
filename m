But as you said, these are "legacy" interrupts, and most of the 
interesting stuff is routed through the system controller. We also try 
not to have core interrupt controllers as modules. As for having the 
firmware interface as a module, I wonder what the use-case is.

I really wonder what the added value is for the user.

Frankly, exposing all kind of data structures to the world is a pretty 
poor form of abstraction, which is what the firmware is supposed to 
provide.

I'd strongly suggest that include/linux/soc/ti/ti_sci_protocol.h gets 
cleaned up, and that the whole ti_sci_ops disappears from the that file. 
Nobody outside of the firmware *implementation* needs to know about its, 
and it would be much better served by a set of helpers.

Finally, please make the TISCI interrupt management part of this series, 
so that I can review it as part of the code that uses it.

Thanks,

	M.
