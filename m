Who is going to checkout the HWRNG tree and run-test it on it's own on
all of the required hardware?  No one.  Agreed, subsystem trees should
be bisectably (new word? :D) buildable as per my first rule above, but
that's it.  Per-subsystem repos are not designed to be tested for
full-functionality orthogonally, that's the point of Stephen's -next
tree.

Please take my other points into consideration too.  The kernel would
be unmainatinable if we all stuck to your rule.  No-one else has that
rule, and for good reason.
