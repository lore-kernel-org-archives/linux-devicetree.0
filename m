It makes perfect sense to me.

By setting the pipeline via DT on boards with simple configurations,
e. g. just one CSI physical interface, it can create just one
devnode (e. g. /dev/video0) with would fully control the device,
without enabling subdev API for such hardware, making the hardware
usable with all V4L2 applications.
