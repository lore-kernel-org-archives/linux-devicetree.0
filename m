The GRCAN core supports selecting between two different hardware interfaces. The 
parameters output0, output1 and selection configures these interfaces and 
selects which one to use. This can not be done in general. For output0 and 
output1 what value means what depends on what hardware is connected to the core. 
If a board has many GRCAN cores they might need different settings for these 
variables. In addition, switching between the two hardware interfaces is 
something that might be wanted to be done at runtime.

For the others module level configuration would work fine.

For output0, output1 and selection, the answer is no due to the reasons pointed 
out above. For the bpr and buffer sizes, that is probably true.

See further down on Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/can/grcan.txt for 
discussion on the device tree matter, or do you something else than configuring 
via bsp files and the like?

OK, I'll get rid of that then and wait for such an interface in the future. It 
would be a pity if hardware filtering, that is a feature that would probably be 
used on an embedded system without multiple users, could never be realized 
because of the socket interface being a multi user concept. If root is the only 
one that can set it up it should be fine in my opinion. Nevertheless, I totally 
agree that a well defined API to enable it would be much nicer than going 
through SysFS.

As I stated in the file, there are no bsp files for sparc. The device trees are 
generated by a boot loader or a prom. For a leon sparc system the boot loader 
gets information from the hardware, the AMBA plug&play, and generates the device 
trees accordingly.

As for 01_03d and 01_034, they are are the names, based on what is found in the 
plug&play, that are generated by a boot loader that does not have a mapping from 
the plug and play to a name. They are not release numbers. They are based on 
vendor and device numbers as found in the plug&play on a leon sparc system.

Compare with these drivers that all use these kind of names to match with the 
hardware:
- drivers/net/ethernet/aeroflex/greth.c
- drivers/tty/serial/apbuart.c
- drivers/usb/host/ehci-grlib.c
- drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c
- drivers/video/grvga.c

The reason for adding Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/can/grcan.txt in the 
first I guess is for someone that takes the IP core outside of a leon system and 
need to write a bsp file for the board. For a leon system (the ordinary 
environment for GRCAN and GRHCAN as pointed out in the file). nothing needs to 
be done for adding support for GRCAN for a new board. The bootloader takes care 
of that.

Once again, "freq" is the property name that is given by the boot loader. 
Compare with drivers/tty/serial/apbuart.c that also relies on "freq".

This approach is used as the information is available from the boot loader in 
this form.

Oops, sorry. That is a mistake. I'll clean that up.


Thanks for the feedback!
