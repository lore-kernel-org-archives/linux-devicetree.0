Yes, it is plain vanilla VAD here. The MICFIL hardware IP sends an interrupt
when voice is detected.

Can you point us to some code that uses kcontrol interface to signal an event?
This might sound silly because I know there are a lot of places where kcontrol
interface is used but I  just want make sure that we are on the same page.
