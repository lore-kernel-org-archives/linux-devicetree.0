I have.

And yet :
 1) This won't go in a _commit_ message (as opposed to cover-letter). Moreover
    it doesn't specify which usecase is not covered by CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED, it
    says, up to my understanding, that is it another way to have to
    CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED flag applied.

 2) I still fail to see why this is necessary
    IOW why declaring the mandatory always-on clocks with the proper flag should
    be augmented with a new clock list. Isn't the existing flag the generic way
    ?

I might not understand the real motivation behind that of course, that's why I'm
asking.

Cheers.
