I remember some discussion on devtree ML that mentioned stdout-path as
possibly generic enough to loose its "linux," prefix.

Maybe Sascha can give a comment on this.

I'd say, just pick the foo in devbus-foo, e.g. "bootcs" for the
one above. Or "devbus_bootcs" if you like.

If you find it out now, great. If not just leave it that way.

Well, you make him the number one person to ask if there is something
wrong with the DT ;) Cc is ok.

Ok, makes sense to me, feel free to leave it that way it is.
