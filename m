not that much

for backuped register or rtt a simple list with spinlock will be enougth
and after just handle the phandle

it's not that complex but if we want to describe the hardware correctly this
is needed

And this will not be AT91 specific but SoC generic

Ensure the GPBR are requested once is mandatory for any bug detection
a global ioremap is really dirty and need to be used when only NO other choice
