ptp_clock_adjtime() casts it to an unsigned and returns an error:

   if ((unsigned long) ts.tv_nsec >= NSEC_PER_SEC)
       return -EINVAL;

See reply to previous email. We can use this ioctl or add a new one as
Arnd suggested. It doesn't matter to me.

See reply to previous email.

Yes that's why I wanted to re-use it. As it currently is, it's not going
to work for reasons I explained in previous follow up yesterday:
