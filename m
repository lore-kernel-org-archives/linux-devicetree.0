Well, it didn't look right before saying 3 are needed, but listing 2. 
However, you can't just change this as it affects all the other SoCs. 
This should probably be a separate patch.

Why is this removed?

Perhaps you should say "can have 1 or 2 channels".

Looks like one clock to me.

It's better to not move this, but just add what compatibles it does or 
doesn't apply to.

Is this really different enough to need an example? Examples don't 
need to enumerate all possible options. They are often wrong because 
they don't compile on their own and that creates a maintenance burden.
