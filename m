I can clearly understand this concern, because in the case of OMAP4, we 
will have to add ~250 nodes if we want to define the current clock tree.

If we are not ready to accept 4k lines of clock data inside the 
devicetree, which is indeed huge and mostly useless, then I think we 
should just expose the leaf clocks. But then they will depend on parent 
that will not be in DT but in static files, which might be weird.

I'm not sure what the right answer is :-(
