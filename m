Ok, so the workaround in that series is to set up the timer clk manually
in the SoC specific code (dm365_init_time etc) and register it to the
clk subsystem, right?

That seems to be a much more appropriate workaround than adding
back early_platform devices. We can always try to do something better
later, but for now I'm happy with that as a workaround.

Please clarify: do we have to set up the clk registers for the timer
here just because we can't rely on the bootloader to have it set up
initially, or is there some other reason? I think what some other
platforms do is to treat the timer clock as a fixed-rate clock that
is not managed by the actual clk driver but is set up by uboot
before we enter the kernel, and then the clk driver just makes sure
it doesn't turn that clk off later.
