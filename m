So who made their review? The guys from crypto?=0A=
=0A=
If someone wants to enable only the DMA functionality of the CCP and not =
=0A=
the crypto part how do they do it? Look for it in the crypto submenu?=0A=

We have a platform that doesn't have a dedicated DMA controller but has =0A=
the CAAM hardware block that can perform dma transfers. We have a =0A=
use-case where we need to issue large transfers (hundred of MBs) =0A=
asynchronously, without using the core.=0A=
