Assuming that is indeed the case (though code and comments suggest
otherwise), it is still not a matter of choice for clients to 'make' a
channel RX or TX or RXTX. That is the property/constraint of the
controller and the controller driver should simply check for channel
ID to be zero in send_data() and return error if its non-zero.

I am not for such paranoia. Provider drivers is not the place to check
for valid user data.
The controller driver should simply reject send_data() request on any
mailbox > 0 while the consumer driver should scream for attention
because that's where the problem is.

Please note, what I suggest will only make the code simpler while not
breaking anything.

Thanks.
