I reason I preprend a10sr_ is to distinguish this GPIO from the other 
GPIOs when binding to our LEDs (see below). I think the LEDs need a 
unique node name (unless I'm not understanding something).

A less important reason I use a10sr_gpio on the node name is that I can 
cat the /sys/class/gpio/gpioxxx/label and see that it is associated with 
the a10sr instead of one of our other general GPIOs. Is there a better 
way to distinguish these?

The reason I use _ for the node name is that the DTC fails if I 
reference a node name with "-" but works OK for "_". For instance, I get 
an error if the LEDs reference "a10sr-gpio" but "a10sr_gpio" compiles ok.

Thanks for reviewing!
