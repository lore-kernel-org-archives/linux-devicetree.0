We normally only take patches from subarch maintainers that know who
we are and how it works, but we don't want to be Cc'd on every single
patch, so we don't have an entry in MAINTAINERS directly.

No worries, if you are unsure you can always ask us on the mailing
list or on the #armlinux channel on irc.freenode.net.

If you have more than a few patches at once, we'd always appreciate
a pull request, for a couple of patches, emails to arm-DgEjT+Ai2ygdnm+yROfE0A@public.gmane.org plus
linux-arm-kernel are fine as well.

When you do pull requests, please split them up according to larger
topics, e.g. send dts changes separately from code changes, and
separate bug fixes, cleanups and new feature support.

Often when you add a new driver, that will require sending the driver
code to a subsystem maintainer, and the dts changes to us. If everything
goes well, your DT bindings are both forward and backward compatible,
so they can get merged independently. If you ever have interdependencies
between them, talk to us first so we can find a solution.

For sending pull requests, it would be good to have a gpg key that
is signed by other well-known kernel developers. If you have such
a key, you can also request a kernel.org account to host a git tree
there, or you can host a git tree somewhere on your company's domain.
A public hosting service like github is not as good for us, but we
can deal with it when you are still ramping up your infrastructure.
Let me know if you need help finding kernel developers to sign your key.
