I'm somewhat confused here.

The top level node appears to be a timer controller (per the reg
property description), but the marvell,timer-id property describes an
index within the timer controller. This does not seem to make sense.

How do you describe multiple timers within a given timer contoller? Is
the timer-id a list? Or do you describe the controller repeatedly?

Using the clock bindings:

	clocks = <&apb_plck>, <&clock_controller 0 3>;
	clock-names = "apb_pclk", "fastclk";

The driver can then query the frequencies, enable/disable the clocks as
required, etc.

Ok, but in all of these cases the blocks that you are giving different
compatible strings are identical. The only difference is how you expect
Linux to use them.

Why can you not just describe the set of timers available to Linux and
allow it to allocate them as required?

I'm arguing for dynamically deciding how to use the timers, not assuming
one of the three cases you've laid out above, and not describing a
possible software use of the counters in the DT.

The reg doesn't have to be a register space -- it's often used simply as
a form of address/identifier without a size (consider SPI's use of the
reg property). Here the index is essentially an address/identifier for
the counter.

Given that the each timer also seems to have a unique ID perhaps using
the reg is not the best strategy here. I was simply raising the
possiblity.

How the interrupt is wired and whether it is shared is not important
from the view of the binding. What is important is which interrupt from
the timer is being described. If it has a given name, that should be
mentioned. Otherwise a simple description will suffice.

The presence of external interrupt muxing doesn't seem to be important
here to the binding -- in that case an OS could request shared
interrupts or decide to only make use of a subset of interrupts. That
seems to be outside of the scope of the binding.

Is there any real topological relationship between CPUs and counters, or
is this arbitrary? If the latter, why can the kernel not decide how to
allocate timers to CPUs?

Ok. This is a Linux interenal detail that I do not think should be in
the DT.

That's fine, we can do that in the absence of both this property and
another timer (the arch timer).

In that case the arch timer will register (which can have a higher
rating than this timer), and this timers can be automatically repurposed
as the broadcast source.

I do not see the necessity of this property.

The naming and use of this property still seems incredibly
Linux-specific.

Why can some of the counter interrupts not be routed to an arbitrary
CPU?
