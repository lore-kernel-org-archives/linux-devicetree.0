Sorry for confusing.

The SGTL5000 is based on regulators and when it is disabled, there will be an error returns directly while the SGTL5000 codec is probing.
But on VF610 boards there has no regulators or needn't configure them, so the CONFIG_REGULATOR is disabled, and then the error is returned causing
to the SGTL5000 probe broken. 

Has I make it clear?

Yes, it is.

How about adding one node properties like : "regulator-exist", which will be controlled by platform data ?
