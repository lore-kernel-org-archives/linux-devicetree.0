As it stands, the dts are buggy. I can appreciate that you don't feel
this is important, but I do. It's not just an IMX issue, there is
widespread misunderstanding and abuse of simple-bus.

Said abuse is relying on current Linux implementation details, and that
can and will create problems if and when probing code is changed.
There's no good reason for abusing the binding when we can get it right
today.

We don't necessarily have to get rid of every simple bus in use as a
regulator container. While I don't like that use, I am happy to accept
them as long as they are used correctly, with a valid ranges property
and with children having sensible reg values (or no reg values if the
children don't need them as part of their binding).

As far as I can see, that's not what ePAPR says:

  If the node has no reg property, the @ and unit-address must be
  omitted and the node-name alone differentiates the node from other
  nodes at the same level in the tree.

If a binding doesn't require a reg property, then the node shouldn't
have a reg property. If that's true then the node should not have a
unit-address.

Using generic names can certainly help to make dts more legible, and we
don't have to go against that. It's just as easy to understand
regulator_1 and regulator@1.

I can appreciate that this area may be unclear, and that fixing this up
creates churn for what you feel is a minor issue. However, I don't see
that as a reason to perpetuate wrongness.

Thanks,
Mark.
