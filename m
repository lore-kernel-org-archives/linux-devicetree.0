The ARM definition of AMBA encompasses a lot of things. It is the 
definition of the AXI, AHB and APB buses. It also has the definition of 
the peripheral ID register definitions which primarily only ARM Ltd 
peripherals implement. You can have those bus types yet not have any 
peripherals with the ID registers. The Linux amba bus primarily deals 
with just the peripheral ID for probe matching. There is also bus clock 
handling, but that's not really unique to an AMBA bus. Arguably the 
platform bus could have bus clock handling as well.

That is how it is currently, but the reality is that I only have 1 bus 
with both ARM Primecell peripherals and other peripherals which are 
standard platform bus devices. i2c-designware is one example. It is on 
the APB just like the pl011 uart. So do you propose I create a amba 
driver for it? It has no peripheral ID registers, so that may not even work.
