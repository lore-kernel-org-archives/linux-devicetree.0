Yes, but I fear this could bring confusion if someone is building a RTT
driver that is not targeted at acting as a RTC...

The "C" at the end stands for "Controller" (not very useful convention
in my opinion).

I found xxx-rtt-as-rtc or xxx-rtt-rtc but not completely satisfied with
any of them...

Oh, really? I will have a look one of those days...

Already submitted, my dear ;-)
