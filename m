You're right, Fabio.
The barebox driver from which I stole the binding had a confd and no nstat.
I've got an nstat and no confd.
One or the other is needed to know whether the bitstream was loaded.

I can add support for using the confd, but with no way to test it, I forebear.

I guess they should both be optional and a note placed that this driver
currently uses only the nstat.

Will change the doc to reflect that.
