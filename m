So can we please have a comment *in the code* that explains how this
value has been picked?

I can't see any absolute guarantee that they wouldn't be reordered (but
I have no insight on the micro-architecture either). I'd rather err on
the side of caution here.

Please ignore what checkpatch says. Readability is more important (and
I've given up using a vintage vt100...).

The right thing should probably be to use a flag in the clocksource
structure to mark it as "suitable for vdso", but I guess we can fix that
in a subsequent patch.

There is no guarantee that the host device tree is always accessible to
userspace. So we're probably looking at requiring a new KVM device API
that would expose the timer properties, one of them being this erratum.
That's certainly going to be fun to handle.
