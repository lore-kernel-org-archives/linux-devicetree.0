If we don't know what quality standards we require for ACPI, then I
would rather see ACPI delayed until we are more comfortable with it than
to enforce an arbitrary set of rules required to enable mapping it to
device tree.

I'm not sure it's entirely reasonable to assume that Microsoft will
swoop in and develop standards that are useful to us or even applicable
to the vast majority of the systems that are likely to exist. If they
do, then we will (by the expectation that Linux should be able to run
wherever another OS can) have to support whatever standards they may
create.

Regardless of whether we place support for it into Linux, we should
certainly be spending time now attempting to understand ACPI, what it
does and does not provide, and how it can be moved towards something
that fulfils our needs and we can support long-term. We should certainly
not be taking a back seat approach.

Outside of the ARM Linux community there is work ongoing to change ACPI
to better suit the level of variation we seem in the ARM space (see
Darren Hart's presentation from ELCE [1]). We need to be involved now in
order to make sure that this is actually generally applicable.

Until ACPI is able to provide all the necessary information, and has
suitable standard mechanisms for describing the horrible portions we are
only just figuring out how to describe in DT, then ACPI is eitehr no
better or worse than DT, and should not be used.

However, we should be looking into it so that when portions of it
eventually appear we have enough of an understanding to cull the
obviously broken parts.

I would also expect that _any_ ACPI support we would accept would not
rely on any board-specific support code whatsoever -- either everything
comes from ACPI or the platform doesn't boot. If we allow board files
for a transitionary period to ACPI we'd be making the same mistake we
did with DT.

To me, reworking the AML code and drivers to support AML + DT feels like
dragging the whole kernel through it. I would rather see ACPI in full or
no ACPI than a gigantic ARM-specific set of changes to general
infrastructure that we'd expect to deprecate in future once we
understand (the future state of) ACPI.

As mentioned above, I think that the work to do this is going to end up
as a weird ARM-specific legacy feature. We will get something wrong here
in a way that we have to support long-term. I would rather support
solely DT or solely ACPI at runtime (with a kernel supporting both),
rather than a mixture of both forever due to an artifact of the
development process.

This common place is going to end up handling arbitrarily different
idioms in each format (e.g. how GPIOs are represented), and is almost
certainly going to become a sprawling mess. Also having "all the fixups"
in there makes this sound like an every-single-board file, which is
something I think everyone would like to avoid.

Until I see code, I'm going to remain of the opinion that this is
unworkable without embedding knowledge of every separate subsystem
(GPIO, IRQ, etc) into a single place. That seems worse to me than
teaching those subsystems to deal with the different information
sources.

This may be true. I worry that by working on this assumption we will
lead people to do the wrong thing by focusing on short-term gain (i.e.
placing board-specific hacks all other drivers and not handling the
general case), rather than getting a long term solution together.

If a vendor does this, with a DTB that correctly describes their
hardware then I am not against it (and would prefer this case to mapping
from ACPI to DT). For that case we will also require a nailed-down boot
protocol that allows for either DTB or ACPI (only one at a time).

The UEFI spec pulls in portions of ACPI. I do not know the full extent
of the interaction between the two, but I know that they are not
completely decoupled. As you have pointed out we are not experienced
with ACPI or UEFI, so I don't think we can make statements that one is
perfectly fine without the other.

There are many people in the Linux community who have ACPI experience.
They may not be active on the ARM side, but it's not fair to say there
are no known best practices. I will agree that for the level of
variation we're likely to expect we are pushing the boundaries.

Again, I'm not sure that we should rely on Windows as our saviour from
insanity. A lot of the issues we are going to encounter are going to be
in vendor-specific code (i.e. drivers), and I do not believe that is
solved by having a single entity in charge of the general frameworks
those are built upon.

I agree that today a DTB is preferable to an ACPI implementation.

I think that mapping from ACPI => DT is less sane than building support
for ACPI, and is not going to help us in the long term.

I think that we need to be involved in ACPI from today if we have any
hope of having something sane in future.
