Right, that's the main issue I was trying to highlight; the driver no
longer provides complete knowledge of the HW, but only learns about
stuff that happens to be used/defined in the board-specific DT.

For early board bringup, it may be useful to boot with a minimal set of
entries in the DT (enough to support e.g. serial console and some device
for a root filesystem) and then interactively tweak the rest of the
pinmux to define the rest of the board, and perhaps even save the result
somehow, and add it to the next iteration of the DT.

Also, consider a hobbyist-oriented board that has 50 unused pins that
could be GPIO, or mapped to some otherwise unused SD, I2C, SPI, ...
controller. Do we want to force the user to write a new DT and reboot,
or would it be better to provide some runtime API to set up those pins
based on what they had connected to the board, and then instantiate
drivers or use the sysfs GPIO interface, after doing so?
