Hi Dmitry,

It seems that this series has fallen through the cracks *again*.

This is a resend of the resend of this set posted a while back, now rebased
on top of v4.6-rc1.

Last time one remark you made was:

+#include <asm/types.h>

> If you are trying to add this to have s32 typedefs
> then I think it is wrong one.

I've double checked and I believe it is the right one,
s32 is typedef-ed in <asm-generic/int-ll64.h> but no-one is including that
directly.

Regards,

Hans
