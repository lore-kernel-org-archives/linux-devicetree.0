Hmm, Jon Masters from Red Hat sounds too like UEFI/ACPI is the way to go.

But maybe he's right and hiding ugly code in proprietary/binary firmware 
blobs where no one can see and criticize it is really the way to go.

Personally I think it's a way back to the past ("when everything was 
better", at least that is what most human brains do like to suggest) and 
just a dream. And I don't believe that the stuff which was and is hidden 
away always just works and doesn't need fixes (one can't do themself). 
In my humble opinion that's a nice but wrong myth and doesn't take into 
consideration that HW (and SW) gets more and more complicated too (and 
thus more faulty).

And even the biggest companies already have problems to produce stuff
which just works (they just employ humans too), not to speak from 
smaller board vendors. So it's much better to keep the source as visible 
as possible to as much people as possible (in the OS) and not to rely on 
some binary blob as most BIOSes are.
