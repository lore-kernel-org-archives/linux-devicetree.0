Strongly agreed that we should fix this before it is published (I assumed
that is was included in 3.19, it felt so long ago that Mark merged it...). My
preference would be to remove the pll-lock things entirely though. Assuming
you don't need it for your board of course, but I doubt it from your description.
I used it to make sure I had understood the chip correctly, that's all.

Cheers,
Peter
