Oh, didn't know of this framework. Is it supposed to replace syscon?

Uhm, in DT I have:

reg = <0x01c00000 0x27>;

that is I'm mapping the first three registers: SRAM_CTRL_REG0,
SRAM_CTRL_REG1, VER_REG, leaving out the three register (from offset
0x30) of the NMI controller.
I'm not lying :)

It seems quite a few grepping for syscon

So do you suggest to drop the syscon idea waiting for the new soc framework?
