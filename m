All definitions in include/dt-bindings/ are part of the DT ABI, and cannot be
changed without breaking the DT binding.

Hence when adding new entries, they must be added at the end of the list,
using a new available value.

Apart from that, what happens if you boot a new DTS on a kernel with an old
clk-rcar-gen2 driver that doesn't know about the new CPG clock?
Does it just fail to initialize and find that single clock, or does
the whole CPG
driver fail?
I wanted to check that after seeing the RCAN CPG patch, but haven't gotten to it
yet due to Xmas and NY holidays.

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
