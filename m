We have of_device_is_available() and for_each_available_child_of_node()
to check for the status property. This doesn't seem much extra overhead.

there is also of_ioremap().

Having sub-nodes for each individual PHY managed by a controller seems
very reasonable to me. Making them show up as separate platform devices
seems less useful though.
