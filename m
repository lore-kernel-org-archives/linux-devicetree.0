I don't really agree here; I specifically named all the Tegra DTB/.dts
files in a sane fashion precisely so that U-Boot could easily determine
which one to load. It's hard to see how this wasn't a predictable issue.

I would expect it to work in both scenarios.

Assuming the DTB is in a filesystem rather than in a singleton location
in flash, the DTB must have a filename. It'd be far better to store each
board's DTB as a separate filename, rather than have some process copy
"the" DTB to a singleton filename at install time. Doing so allows the
same filesystem to work on multiple boards unmodified.

As an example, I move my SD card between ~10 different Tegra boards
without touching its content, and U-Boot loads the correct DTB based on
the board it's running on. Pengutronix demo'd a single SD card being
moved between a couple of entirely unrelated boards at ELC-E too.

Given that assumption, the bootloader must somehow determine which
filename to load at boot time, rather than some one-time installation
process doing the picking operation.

Well, you could patch either:-)

That means distros have to have board identification logic, and
explicitly have code that selects the correct DT. Thus, distros would
have to be explicitly ported to each board (since IDing the board would
need some kind of board specific logic). Isn't the push towards
single-zImage and DT explicitly so that distros require zero
board-specific knowledge?

BTW, since the outcome of this discussion possibly affects distro
installers and kernel packages, perhaps the discussion should take place
on, or be CC'd to, cross-distro-cunTk1MwBs8s++Sfvej+rw@public.gmane.org?
