I could take a look, but AFAIK none of our drivers need to propagate
clock rate changes.

I just reran my tests on the A31, and dmatest indeed passes.
I'm using your A31 sdcard.img, replaced u-boot with one built from
u-boot-sunxi, so it supports DT.

I also checked both the clock framework and the raw registers.
AHB1 is indeed clocked from AXI on my system.

Full log: https://gist.github.com/wens/ae17aed6728b83c0a9c3

If you (or someone else with A31) can verify the results,
maybe we can just drop this patch.
