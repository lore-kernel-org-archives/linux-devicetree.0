I don't think you're considering real-world usage scenarios, but instead
concentrating on the use issues.  If you only do that you're boxing
yourself into a corner and will cause a world of pain for folk who would
just like the kernel to be usable.

The information in ATAGs which will either never be in DT or which should
override what is in DT is:

- memory parameters
- command line
- initrd location
- system serial number
- system revision number

Things like the serial number will _never_ be in DT (do you want to build
a DT image unique to each platform?)  initrd location will never be in
DT either (it depends where the boot loader placed it.) ... and so forth.

This is the kind of information which should override whatever is in
DT because the DT contained information could well be wrong or outdated,
and its not the kind of information that anything other than core code
should be dealing with in any case.

So, that means Nicolas' patches which allow a DT to be appended to the
image need to have DT and ATAG parsing in them to update the DT stuff
with the ATAG information.

See above.
