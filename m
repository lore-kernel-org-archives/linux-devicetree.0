in my board the over current gpio is active low too, i was just mentiontioning
to add that in case yours  was not.

Perhaps. i dont have a board that has overcurrent, or that i can
switch vbus off.
what is exactly the log you are refering to?

im wondering, was the behavior different before the patches?
it should be the same without the patches.

im guessing that unplug and plug wont work as vbus is gone and
we cannot detect it anymore (contrary to my setup were i always have vbus)
sorry for suggesting that before.

we could recover vbus automatically form the notification,
(when the over-current condition disappears) but then im afraid we
might oscillate, even if we retry after some timeout. so perhaps
bind/unbind is the right thing to do, as it requires the user to correct
the problem. I dont know if there is a better solution.
