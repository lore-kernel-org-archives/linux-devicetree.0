With the transceiver node being implemented as a phy, remove the legacy
dcoumentation. Don't remove the code implementing it to maintain dt
compatibility.

-Generic CAN transceiver Device Tree binding
-------------------------------
-
-CAN transceiver typically limits the max speed in standard CAN and CAN FD
-modes. Typically these limitations are static and the transceivers themselves
-provide no way to detect this limitation at runtime. For this situation,
-the "can-transceiver" node can be used.
-
-Required Properties:
- max-bitrate:	a positive non 0 value that determines the max
-		speed that CAN/CAN-FD can run. Any other value
-		will be ignored.
-
-Examples:
-
-Based on Texas Instrument's TCAN1042HGV CAN Transceiver
-
-m_can0 {
-	....
-	can-transceiver {
-		max-bitrate = <5000000>;
-	};
-	...
-};
