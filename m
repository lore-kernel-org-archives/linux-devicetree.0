I wonder if that makes any kind of sense. The RealView platforms does not
really share much more than the name, sadly. For example: IP blocks
aren't even at the same address.

I could create a .dtsi file but it would be empty :-(

I have looked at it. Patch titled
"power: reset: Add generic SYSCON register mapped reset"

Sadly it does not work for our case. This is because it assumes that
reboot will be triggered by writing one value to one register. The RealViews
need you to *first* write to a special unlock register, then write a magic
value to a magic register.

So of course we could extend the syscon regmap reset driver by
starting to encode a jam table such as a sequence of register writes
to a sequence of registers, but we have refused such code in the past
because as I recall Grant said, it is the beginning of a byte code
interpreter and then we could as well bite the bullet and start
implementing open firmware.

This is exactly the type of thing that ACPI AML code usually does
by the way so what he says makes a *lot* of sense.

So for now I keep to our special driver.

OK fixed.

Well yeah, the version of the driver that is in linux-next does this.
This was parallel work and I had no idea which would reach
mainline first :-)

Anyway, I just deleted because I realized it was better if I came
up with the concept of syscon-leds to handle this through the
syscon.

This we can fix.

Mainly because I had this other review comment that I
should use IS_ENABLED() rather than #ifdef and it
seemed better but I don't know anymore...

I just need a base branch I guess, then I can build on
top of Russell's patches, it's just a matter of dependencies.

The question can be rephrased like this:
Should we create drivers/soc?

The structure of the SoC bus device is maybe a bit irritating but it
has been hammered into the device core so now we have to live with
it as it is.

Yes, same answer :-)

Hm that's true. I introduced yet another set of compatible tuples
like this:
compatible = "simple-bus", "arm-realview-pb1176-soc"

It will, just like the reset driver generate a new batch of identical
compatible-strings and documenation sets, but it does have the
upside of clean separation.

I don't know that actually. And as DMA is likely only used
on PCI I have no way of testing it either without such hardware.
But I guess I can just leave it out for the time being.
