Hey guys,

according the dw_apb_timer I need your statement...

You can look at my github repo for the new driver, rewriting the
interface as discussed above:
https://github.com/Astralix/linux-rockchip/blob/wip/dw_timer64/drivers/clocksource/dw_apb_timer.c

Summary: It is a 90% rewrite of the complete dw_apb_timer.c and
modifications of dw_apb_timer_of.c and dw_apb_timer.h and the related
x86 drivers are needed.
And after that the 64bit functionality is still not given as the
existing structures do not take it. But for now scheduler doesn't
support 64bit either, I guess.

The drivers local struct stays, but instead of carrying pointers to
registers it now consists of function pointers. This could be used to
fit almost any kind of timer.

I would really appreciate your comments. Sure I need to clean up a bit,
but we're still testing. But before investing more time into that code I
need you comment if I should continue or split to a separate driver for
these kind of timers.

Thanks for any comments

Regards
	Ulrich
