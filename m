My original idea is: use spin-table for SMP now, when firmware is OK to
support PSCI, we submit another patch to replace the spin-table with PSCI.

If DTB should continue to work in the future, we really need to remove
the spin-table
from current dts file, how about just enable one core now?

Which one do you favor or any other suggestion?

In fact, Hisilicon designs several system controllers for different
function domains,
we can control different functions(e.g. clk gate on or off /IP reset)
based on the base
address of controller + offset, I will give more description in next version.

> Please also split documentation into earlier patches.
OK, separate document and code in next version.
