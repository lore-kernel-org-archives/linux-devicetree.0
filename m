Please do remember to CC maintainers on e-mails if you're looking for a
response, this is standard practice for kernel stuff due to the number
of high volume mailing lists and busy maintainers.  I've added Liam into
the CCs.

A few comments:

 - There's no mention of clocking in the page, which is one of the more
   exciting bits of this stuff.  Reading the page I'm not sure that
   we've even fully captured the problem definition.

 - I'm not sure what "ALSA quirking" is?

 - "i2s" isn't the best thing to use in a property name, I2S is just one
   of several different standards for interconn

 - How does the way you're defining the audio links cope with multi-drop
   links (eg, bluetooth and cellular modem on the same bus)?
