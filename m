What would you suggest?

I merged arm-soc/drivers/ocp2scp into my dts branch to get a proper base
for that series, but as expected, it conflicts :-(

So I fixed that and pulled this series on top of it.

It is something acceptable for a pull request? We already did that in
the past, but at that time it was not conflicting.

Thanks,
Benoit
