I suppose it's just shorthand. The datasheet describes the actual requirements
for both oscillators, where it clearly states the 32K one should be 32768 Hz.
A scope shouldn't be needed as we expect the board design to at least conform
to constraints outlined in datasheets.

On the side, the LOSC be _around_ 32kHz if you clocked it from the internal
RC oscillator, which is not very stable. This is actually the hardware default.
But the WiFi module (and also the RTC) needs 32.768K, a slight difference,
but enough to throw off calculations for other clocks. When the RTC module
isn't clocked from the external crystal, the RTC clock will drift. This has
been reported and is why we have

    /* Switch to the external, more precise, oscillator */
    writel(SUN6I_LOSC_CTRL_KEY | SUN6I_LOSC_CTRL_EXT_OSC,
           rtc->base + SUN6I_LOSC_CTRL);

in the RTC driver's clock probe function. See these two patches:

    fb61bb82cb46 rtc: sun6i: Switch to the external oscillator
    3855c2c3e546 rtc: sun6i: Expose the 32kHz oscillator

Note the commit message for the second patch is incorrect. We actually force
the RTC module to use the external crystal regardless of the "clocks" property.

I actually forgot about this. So even without assigning clock rates your patch
would work fine. Hope this doesn't confuse you more than it already has.
