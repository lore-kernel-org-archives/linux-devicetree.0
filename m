fdt_add_subnode() will create a new node as you require.  The
"subnode" is just supposed to indicate that the parameters are in the
form of the offset of the parent node and the new node's immediate
name, rather than taking a full path name for the new node.

Yes, you will need to do this, fdt_open_into() is the function you
want.  Without making room first, adding nodes or expanding existing
properties will return -FDT_ERR_NOSPACE.  Once you've made whatever
edits you need, you can use fdt_pack() to collapse the tree back to
its minimum size.

Although this is somewhat awkward, this approach is a deliberate
design decision, to avoid making libfdt dependent on a working general
purpose allocator, which may not be available when libfdt is used in
very limited environments such as a firmware/bootloader.

If you do find things you need to do which libfdt doesn't support, I'm
more than happy to extend it as necessary.
