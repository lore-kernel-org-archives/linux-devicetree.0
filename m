Oh! I hadn't realised the Nomadik was v5. The above will be completely
irrelevant. Sorry for wasting everyone's timer over this.

In way of an explanation, further down the thread [1,2] it becomes a discussion
of /cpus node requirements. The long and short of it is that for v{6,7} there's
no standard way of detecting the number of CPUs, and no way of detecting the
CPU IDs (MPIDR.Aff{2,1,0}), so we should always describe this in dt.

For v5 this is indeed useless.

I think all v6+ platforms should have /cpus/cpu@N nodes for consistency across
UP and SMP systems. For v{4,5}, this isn't really necessary, unless people want
to conform to the letter of the law from ePAPR ("A cpus node is required for
all device trees."). I'm not too worried about this.

Sorry, I should've linked to the more relevant parts of the thread [1,2].

I was asking for a /cpus/cpu node, but as you've pointed out this is a v5
platform, and as such this isn't needed.

Hopefully the above explanation makes sense?

Thanks,
