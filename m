Do you have a specific question here?

The devicetree additions are mostly identical to their counterparts in
the BSP devicetree. The only real exception being that the usdhc1
regulators have been replaced by the sd8787 power sequence, which allows
the mmc core to reset the wifi/bt chip (which is not possible with the
regulator setup). Note that the sd8787 power sequence binding/driver has
only recently been added to Linux (v4.11) and is not present in the BSP
kernel.

Furthermore, the Bluetooth AMP function is disabled in the BSP kernel
by CompuLab [1] for the same reason we do not enable the usdhc1 node in
this patch. (We cannot disable it in the driver because, as explained in
the commit message, this would yield a regression.)

Thanks,
Christopher
