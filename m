So just to check... These two current sources are effectively
pushing current out of the ADC input pin?  Assumption being that
this causes an appropriate voltage across a component between there
and 0V?

I wonder if we are better off not treating these as regulators at
all - whilst you could in theory use them for general purposes, it
would be a bit nuts and sometimes the 'it is nuts argument' is
enough to mean we don't support something :)

I wouldn't have any problem with an additional attribute for the
adc channels - maybe something like...

in_voltage6_sourcecurrent?  Then the control could be pushed to
userspace. 

Or if it only makes sense to do it as a fixed value in DT then
define optional child nodes for the individual channels, with
the relevant ones have current-source-microamp or
something like that as an parameter.

What do you think?
