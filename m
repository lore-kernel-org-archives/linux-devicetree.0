Currently loading bitstream via firmware interface is used.

I have built bitstream from vivado 2014.4 and if you dump bit you will
see this.

All stuff in front of 0xaa995566 at 0xa0 is header.

On the other hand bin format has also small header which can be skipped
for devcfg usage but doesn't need to be (I have tested it)

I do use this command for bitstream in bin format generation (it was in
edk 14.7).
promgen -p bin -data_width 32 -b -u 0x0 *.bit -w
