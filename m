My philosophical problem with this is that I don't view this usb-switch
as a usb device. It isn't addressable via the typical USB addressing
scheme. It's just a simple chip wired down on the board that muxes two
wires without considering what goes across those wires.

I would agree if this switch was a usb device itself that had a vid/pid
that we could talk to to switch the mux. But that isn't the case here.

What do we do about a hub downstream of the mux like usb3503? If that's
on the i2c bus and we need to do some initial setup, shouldn't we put
the hub under the i2c bus (because that's the addressing scheme) instead
of under the switch and then use of-graph to describe the connections
that aren't being used for addressing? My understanding of of-graph is
pretty weak so perhaps I missed something.
