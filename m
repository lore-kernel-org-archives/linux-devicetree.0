Thanks for doing this.

The above describes the set of problems, but doesn't set out the actual
contract. It also covers a number of Linux implementation details in
abstract.

As I commented previously [1], the binding should describe the set of
guarantees that you rewquire (e.g. that the clocks must be left as-is,
not gated, and their rates left unchanged).

Please describe the specific set of guarantees that you require.

Thanks,
Mark.
