I can separate the platform driver into a new file but they will have to be
compiled into the same module as the new additions to the i2s driver depend on
functions of the platform driver (see i2s_irq_handler()). Or should I divide
this into two modules and add a Kconfig option to the platform driver? Besides
this I first wanted the driver to be compiled into the same module so that it is
compatible with kernel 3.18 where simple audio card requires that platform
driver == cpu driver.

Best regards,
