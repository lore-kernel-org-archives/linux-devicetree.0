I'm sorry that it's so emotional. Let's keep to technical arguments.

And what I am saying here is that "not right now" is the right answer
for the linux kernel. For technical reasons.

Which in turn is DoS:ing linux development. Now we need to sign up for
a third party committee to set the direction for the kernel? Sorry,
that's not the way we do things around here.

Trust me, we're not going to ignore them, we want them supported.

Nothing is going to work reliably with ACPI right now, period. It's a
completely immature technology on ARM, and if we lock in hard to the
current implementaitons we're all going to lose. Big. You have yet to
address that part of the argument in any of your replies.

It's taken us years to sort out device tree, and we've been able to cope
with it by the fact that we have been able to change both sides of the
border (both the DTB and the kernel). With ACPI, we're entering a hard
lock-in on day one.  Meanwhile the very first patches look considerably
worse than any of the first device-tree ones did, and vendors are clearly
not getting help from you.

There is. Apple, IBM and Sun obviously figured out how to ship enterprise
systems without ACPI, didn't they?

Market segment is irrellevant to the discussion at hand.

Clearly you haven't been following any of the recent development w.r.t. device
tree and the policy changes on backwards compatibility.

What makes you so sure that vendors won't do crazy custom stuff on
top of ACPI? You seem confident that they'll be able to sort it out
themselves. Initial data on the subject indicates the polar opposite.

You know why you've been asked to update the device trees? Because
everyone is trying to figure out how to make this all work in a good way.

With ACPI, there's _no way_ to do any of that. And you think that's a
good thing? It's not, because the alternative is to start littering the
kernel with lots and lots of quirks and fixups.

I think what concerns me the most about the current situation is
exactly this.  You've been scheming for several years now, and now
when push comes to shove, it's obvious that the vendors have no idea
what they're doing with ACPI. Whenever there's a discussion about it,
we get thrown these kind of vague "oh you'll see what's coming" arguments.

Sure, we will, but until we see these promised awesome things in public,
we're going to base things on what we know and see. And what we've
seen so far is not promising. It's looking like in the short to medium
term, locking ourselves to ACPI, on any platforms, is going to be a
huge mistake.

ACPI long-term might be a great thing, once vendors have gone through a
couple of product generations and everybody has learned how to use ACPI
properly. Until then we're building up a huge technical debt that we'll
have to carry forever.

Implement ACPI if you want, but while all those things are sorted out,
we'll continue shipping device tree. If you look at the Calxeda DT sources,
they've been completely table for quite a while now. It can, and will, be done.

Nobody is talking about removing the AML pieces here. Keep them around, but
bring them over to the DT implementation if you have to.

Actually, that's an excellent approach to the problem at hand and pretty
the ideal outcome as far as I am concerned. Focus on DT now, enable
ACPI as much as possible but it won't be right yet so don't rely on
it. In a few years, when ACPI looks like it's sorted out and reliable,
we can switch over to it.

Again, I am not approaching this emotionally.

I'm looking at the quality of the initial submissions (very poor and
confused), the readiness of the kernel in general (none so far),
the way the involved parties are doing development (away from the
community and in their own little world). I also look at some of the
bottlenecks we've had with device tree (reviewer bandwidth, slow-moving
consensus/standards-driven approval process) and how it compares to the
ACPI counterparts (standards forum).

The conclusion is that we're about to embark onto something that isn't
going to be done right in the short to medium term. It just isn't. The
sooner we own up to that, the sooner we can course-correct and get back
to something that's likely to work.

The alternative is signing onto a setup that _will_ stumble right out
of the door, which in turn will mean that the high-end ARM play will be
off to a rough start instead of running as smoothly as possible.

I'm glad you've found your home with the big boys. Meanwhile, us low-lifes
working on the kernel have a job to do, which is to make sure the lower parts
of the stack will be successful on these new environments long-term,
which might have short-term difficult trade-offs. ACPI is not realistic
today, for all the reasons explained above.
