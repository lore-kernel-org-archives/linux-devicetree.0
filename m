A drivers/pm/ or drivers/power/ could be created, but that implies sort 
of a more defined subsystem with a common API and the SPC code doesn't 
fit that as it is only providing services to actual drivers on top of 
it.

The sanest location at this point might simply be 
drivers/platform/vexpress_spc.c or drivers/platform/vexpress/spc.c 
depending on whether or not more such driver glue is expected in the 
vexpress future.  No point putting "arm" in the path, especially if this 
is later reused on arm64.
