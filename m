Hi Olof,

Last week i had chat with Arnd and Linus over Hangout, and following is
the status:
- Dependency patch of pinctrl is:

commit 4ddb1c295752252f61670e35c791bf16e58bbce6
Author: Viresh Kumar <viresh.kumar-QSEj5FYQhm4dnm+yROfE0A@public.gmane.org>
Date:   Sat Oct 27 15:21:39 2012 +0530

    ARM: SPEAr: Add plgpio node in device tree dtsi files

And is already in pinctrl/devel branch. And this branch is stable as per Linus.

- First patch of this set is applied by Linus in his gpio tree. So,
you need to get
that branch too. And is present in devel branch as:

commit b53bc2819a71099ecfc3d61ba0796b3dcc6be321
Author: Shiraz Hashim <shiraz.hashim-qxv4g6HH51o@public.gmane.org>

    gpio: SPEAr: add spi chipselect control driver
