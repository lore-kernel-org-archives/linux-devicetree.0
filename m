I concur that sx00 is insufficient. Older models were called ATMxxxx.
Unfortunately with owl- it then no longer matches the compatible, but I
wouldn't mind.

Actually I was just asking to include the company name and not just say
Owl. Whether it's Actions, Actions Semi or Actions Semiconductor is not
that important to me - that would be for the Actions Semi colleagues to
comment - which I see are not in CC... Please fix that! You don't need
mp-cs I think, but the others please.

"SoC's" looks weird there, do we have such precedence to add it?
"Actions Owl Clock Management Unit (CMU)" might do?

Saravanan, please compare other patch titles and adapt your subjects
accordingly: "modify bindings" is not very meaningful, since a patch
always modifies something and the prefix already indicates dt-bindings
as target. "Soc" is misspelled. The time-saving information to put there
would be addition of S700.

"S900 and S700 SoCs"? (keep the slash above)

Mani, should we order alphabetically? I.e., will S500 go before S900, or
will people just always append at the end now? Not saying we have to,
but keeping it consistent across Actions bindings would be desirable.
