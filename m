Indeed. This is the tip of the iceberg w.r.t. under-specification of
memory attribute usage.

I agree that whether or not devices are coherent in practice depends on
the kernel's configuration. The flip side, as you point out, is that
devices are coherent when a specific set of attributes are used.

i.e. that if you read dma-coherent as meaning "coherent iff Normal,
Inner Shareable, Inner WB Cacheable, Outer WB Cacheable", then
dma-coherent consistently describes the same thing, rather than
depending on the configuration of the OS.

DT is a datastructure provided to the kernel, potentially without deep
internal knowledge of that kernel configuration. Having a consistent
rule that is independent of the kernel configuration seems worth aiming
for.

A dma-outer-coherent property would allow us to accurately describe the
keystone case in the same way, independent of kernel configuration.

To be clear, I am not arguing against supporting keystone. I just wish
to avoid muddying the waters further w.r.t. the semantics of
dma-coherent, which I believe can be salvaged and made consistent.

Clearly, those semantics are the point of contention here.

Thanks,
Mark.
