Hi Andy, Rasmus,

Thanks for the comments.

There are just two modifiers supported now ('f' and 'P') but should more be
needed in the future, we'd need the loop again. This is basically modelled
after %pOF implementation.

I can simplify this if you both still think that's the way to go, and
make the implementations diverge.

Agreed.
