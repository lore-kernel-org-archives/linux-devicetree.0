Ah, I also struggle with that aspect.  Here I was confused if you meant
QEMU TCG or something like that, and didn't quite understand the
connection.

I usually get away with saying simply user space, or the user space
driver (because user space drives KVM VMs), but I'm not aware of a fixed
unambiguous term.

VMM is probably not a good choice as most virt people think of
hypervisor==VMM.

If implementing PSCI in userspace is not a big deal, then I lean towards
having a CAP and a feature, which simply moves all SMC/HVC calls to QEMU
and lets QEMU handle things.  On the other hand, if we ever want to
support known hypercalls that KVM must service directly, then we'd have
to split things up into different APIs for different types of calls.

If you need something short-term, I suspect only forwarding a limited
set of APIs to user space is the safest way to go, and we can always
include that with PSCI if moving everything to user space.

IIRC, the arch-specific part of the QEMU run loop that calls into KVM,
specifically checks for the things it cares about on exit, and if it
doesn't see anything alarming, it just carries on.

It's a bit borderline to depend on this behavior, given that other
people could have modified QEMU versions or other user space drivers for
KVM deployed, but from a practical point of view, we'll probably be
ok...

I think the key is that the feature is only allowed if user space tells
KVM to notify it, because then we can assume user space also knows how
to deal with the exit code, so sounds good.

Ah, I missed that.  Makes sense.

Right, my point was if we wanted to support this in KVM even if the host
kernel didn't have CONFIG_ARM_SDE_INTERFACE, but it looks like we've
already addressed this.
