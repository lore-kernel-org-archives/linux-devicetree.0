I was wondering whether it'd work with my existing 1st September 2014
version of the trusted firmware.  I've pretty much come to the
conclusion that there's no way I can run the later firmware on this
hardware.

Interesting - maybe the hardware is different then?

I haven't wiped it and copied the entire contents of the zip file over.
I instead backed up the old board.txt and images.txt files, and copied
the HBI0282B directories on top of the others.

This correctly causes all the various components to be updated when the
board boots, updating the MBB BIOS, iofpga, and reprogramming the NOR
flash with the updated images.  I even diff'd what was on the uSD card
and what was supplied in the zip file.

That's one state I tested: it also allowed me to edit the board.txt and
similar to wind back to what I have now on the board - which is all the
old versions of the firmware except for the MBB BIOS.

Anyway, I've wiped the uSD, and copied the contents of the 16.10 release
over:

which looks more hopeful... except it stops there.

As it contains a zero sized Image and .dtb files, I tried copying my
Image and .dtb over, and also copied my original config.txt (only
change is AUTORUN: FALSE).  It still doesn't appear to boot beyond
this point.
