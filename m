Surely for the drivers to be able to announce that they can handle
suspend safely this has to be an irqaction flag?

For IRQD_SHARED_TIMER to work the irqchip would need to set this, and it
doesn't know anything about the drivers (or potentially what any of the
interrupts are if the block is reused).

Indeed!
