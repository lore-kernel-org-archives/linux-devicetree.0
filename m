I can think of two reasons:=0A=
=0A=
1. The code that this driver introduces has nothing to do with crypto =0A=
and everything to do with dma. Placing the code in the same directory as =
=0A=
the caam subsystem would only create confusion for the reader of an =0A=
already complex driver.=0A=
=0A=
2. I wanted this driver to be tracked by the dma engine team. They have =0A=
the right expertise to provide adequate feedback. If all the code was in =
=0A=
the crypto directory they wouldn't know about this driver or any =0A=
subsequent changes to it.=0A=
