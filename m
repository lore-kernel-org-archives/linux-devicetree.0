One thing to consider still is that we have plenty of existing ACPI code
out there where _DSD is not used but instead we rely on the index. An
example would be rfkill-gpio.c driver:

        gpio = devm_gpiod_get_index(&pdev->dev, "reset", 0);
        if (!IS_ERR(gpio)) {
		...
        }

        gpio = devm_gpiod_get_index(&pdev->dev, "shutdown", 1);
        if (!IS_ERR(gpio)) {
		...
        }

It expects that GPIOs returned from _CRS are in specific order. Since we
can't change these existing ACPI tables, we must support them somehow.

This patch series handles it so that:

  1) If we can't find given property (e.g "reset-gpios" or
     "shutdown-gpios") the index above will refer directly to the GPIO
     resource returned from _CRS.

  2) If the property is found we ignore index and take it from the
     property instead.

This has the drawback that we cannot support this:

	Package () { "reset-gpios", Package () { ^GPIO, 0, 0, 0, ^GPIO, 1, 0, 0}}
                                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So the second entry in the above is not accessible using
gpiod_get_index() and the reason is that we want to support the existing
and new ACPI tables where _DSD is not being used.
