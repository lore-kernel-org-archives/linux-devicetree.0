Those nodes in the DT which are useless at the moment should be dropped.
There's no point having them there.

We can add them when driver support is added, along with documentation.

Ok. Please update the unit-address on the nodes to match.

Then we should document it.

As far as I can see this is _not_ used currently; both strings appear
nowhere in mainline.

Drop the node for now. It can be added alongside the driver and binding.

Either document the clock name and make sure it's used consistently, or
drop it. The latter seems like the easiest approach.

Add the node when you add support. Drop it for now.

Ok. So drop the unit-address.
