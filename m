This is not the only apr on msm8996 and some platform seems to have 3-4
aprs. I'm therefor hesitant to use the compatible to pick the static
list of services available on the particular firmware.

If this scheme is followed we at least would need to rename this
qcom,msm8996-apr-audio-svc

But I think it would be preferable to go with qcom,apr-v2 and then list
the static services as child nodes.

This is not the only APR channel, but for apr itself this doesn't matter
and might as well be qcom,glink-channels; so perhaps we can omit this
from this document?
