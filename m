The host can support both, so it is not a property of the host and is a
property of the phy. It is no different than what mode a SPI slave
requires or whether an i2c slave supports 8 or 10-bit addressing. Those
examples are all 1 to many rather than 1 to 1 where it doesn't really
matter, but the same logic applies.
