OK, I agree that this should eventually end up in generic OF handling 
code.  I just wanted to get something out to initiate discussion.

The next patch revision will move this to a more generic home.

I think there is the possibility of finding something like a bridge that 
has an of_node, but does not have the "msi-map" property.  I currently 
have exactly this configuration, as some of the on-SoC devices sit 
behind a bridge, but need an of_node to obtain unprobable properties and 
children (the MDIO bus devices are like this).

So if we want to abort the walk early, we should at least go up until we 
find "msi-map" in the of_node.

OK.  I will make this simplification.

Good catch.  It was a typo on my part.  I am using the default, so my 
device tree doesn't have this property.

I think it is possible to add too many wrapper functions.  IMO, this is 
not too unreadable.

I initially had that, but thought that the fact that any trailing short 
entry would result in a non-functional device, so that would be enough. 
  But I will add it back in.

Hmm, I will see what I can add...

Something has already associated the PCI device with this 
MSI-controller.  Therefore I think the reference in the map must refer 
to this ITS MSI-controller instance.

The PCI host may have many MSI controllers, but I think a given PCI 
device will have only one (based on bus:devfn) that is looked up in the map.
