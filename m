I'm all for a good entropy source for early boot. :)

I need to figure out what's needed for relocation support first
though, before we can really tackle kernel base-address randomization
on ARM. I haven't had a chance to look around too closely yet, but it
seems like only x86 and ppc do this currently? Has anyone looked in
detail and what would be needed on ARM for CONFIG_RELOCATABLE
behavior?
