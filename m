Me either - device trees aren't vendor lock-in but they ARE a huge
reminder of how silicon vendors prioritize software development - the
chip works. The i.MX IOMUX block lends itself VERY well to device
trees.

The problem with vendors is when they ship their chips and docs from
America or Israel or so on, do verification in the UK or Mexico or
India, hand it to a software team in some far away place like China or
India and expect everything to just come out all nice and shiny. The
problem compounds itself when the docs are bad, but in this instance,
Freescale usually give out REALLY good documentation.

The issue with this particular block is there have been 5 different
ways to "do it", originally it was just a list of addresses and values
in an array, then it got turned into a packed 64-bit magic value which
was decoded (possibly to reduce stack usage as a function call,
although it was always inlined...) and then device trees as an
enumerated index into a hardcoded array in Linux, and a pad settings
value on top, and now back to addresses and values again. The number
of possibilities for porting the thing is immense.

The only way to do it from the manual - or Freescale's IOMUX Tool,
which is pretty awesome if a little crashy and for Windows - is the 6
value tuple way.

As an example, this is what I get for the SabreLite Rev A, exported as CSV

I used the last pin in my example previously in the list. Note the
0x04c, 0x360 addresses and 0x1b0b0 pad setting (setting the register
to 0x0 is an instruction to the fsl,pins parsing code to ignore it..
hence the need for better macros)

It would be incredibly easy to parse the CSV (or XML or..) or
cross-check the output source code (since it will give you source
code, if a little obtuse and over excited code) and generate the
preprocessor headers or even fsl,pins output for any particular board.
The Name field, Instance prefix, Signal suffix, and register values
and even the comment from the board designer (if they used the IOMUX
tool and if they didn't, bop on the nose with a newspaper..) right
into a device tree.

So, the design tools exist, they're just not being used, or they're
being misused, or supplemental parsers to extract and generate the
files don't exist (Shawn, we talked about the docs being generated
from the RTL and some ability to export them..)

A schema would help, too..
