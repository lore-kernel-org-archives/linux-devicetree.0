Hi Jingoo,

Arnd has asked about the transition path for 32bit arm PCI host bridges
and I don't think we came up with a solution yet. My preferred solution
would be to modify the arch/arm API to be more in line with the generic
code and not have to use hw_pci and pci_sys_data anymore. That should
fix your problem of having a single code base for your host controller.

If you look at the pci_sys_data and hw_pci structures, you can see that
there is a bit of duplication between the two and also that some of the
data contained in that structure is generic enough to be contained in
the PCI infrastructure code rather than down in the arch-dependent code=
=2E

I confess that I have no in-depth knowledge of the reasons why the arm
code looks like this and if it is still required with the current
infrastructure code. Russell can provide us with entertaining stories h=
ere,
I'm sure, on why the code looks like it does.

I have not done any work in this area yet, but if I were to update the
generic arm code I would try to make the code use the pci_host_bridge
structure rather than pci_sys_data. The hw_pci will disappear with the =
new
APIs.

IMHO it is not worth trying to have the host bridge code cope with two =
APIs.
It's going to lead to problems no matter what.

Best regards,
