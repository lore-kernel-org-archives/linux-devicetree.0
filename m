I'm not on about "100% right", but more "a reasonable chance of being
good enough". The latter is extremely difficult to judge when you just
get a binding document with little or no additional context.

Backwards compatibility is with regards to new software supporting old
bindings. If new HW comes out, we can create new bindings. Old bindings
should remain supported regardless.

As above, reviewing is tricky. One has to spend the time gaining an
understanding of a particular piece of hardware, the class of hardware
it falls in, and also the bigger picture that it fits in. Once you have
that, you have to review the binding in that context, and that takes
time and effort.

As things evolve, perhaps mistakes or inconsistencies are found, or new
ways to generalise things. As that occurs, there is a maintenance burden
for existing bindings.

All of that takes time and effort.

If, at the end of that, a proprietary vendor driver is using a different
version of the binding anyway, because "there's no backward
compatibility to guarantee", then there is no benefit to the document.

Even if that proprietary driver does remain stable, the Linux community
will have done work that only benefits the authors of that driver. We
would prefer that the results of our efforts are open, and benefit all.

I don't follow. If there's no compatibility to guarantee, why do you
want a binding?

A binding is a form of contract -- if you describe the HW this way, then
some software will understand it. You can extend a binding over time,
certainly, but if the baseline of that binding is a moving target, that
benefits nobody.

As with all things, it depends on context. If someone's using a DT to
describe details of the secure world of a platform with trustzone to a
secure OS, then not all of that information is relevant to Linux.
Likewise if configuration details specific to FW are embedded.

If there's information relevant to a general purpose OS, then I would
expect it to be described. By the same token, I would expect a general
purpose OS to actually be making use of the information. In practice,
we've used Linux as the benchmark for that. That needn't necessarily be
the case if another OS can demonstrate that the binding is worthwhile --
ideally we'd have multiple OSs using bindings so as to "keep us honest"
and free from implementation details.

As I mentioned before, an example would help. The theoretical envelope
is very large and likely far beyond what you envisage. We need something
to focus on, or we're arguing about what we conceive differently.

Thanks,
Mark.
