So each iobg still passes down the entire 32-bit address?

Note that you never have to do the calculation in the driver
source, of_iomap and the resource logic both take care of this.

There are multiple ways to handle this, and an empty ranges property
usually works fine, but I find that less readable.

Another way to handle these is to have a separate range for
each child bus, as in arch/powerpc/boot/dts/gef_ppc9a.dts

To stay in the example, this would mean doing something like

        axi {
		#address-cells = <2>;
                #size-cells = <1>;

                ranges = <0 0 0x80000000 0x08000000 // axi devices
			  1 0 0x88000000 0x08000000 // sys-iobg
			  2 0 0x90000000 0x00010000 // mem-iobg
			  3 0 0x90010000 0x07fe0000 // disp-iobg
                          ... >;

                l2-cache-controller@80040000 {
                        compatible = "arm,pl310-cache";
                        reg = <0 0x40000 0x1000>;
                        interrupts = <59>;
                };

                sys-iobg {
			#address-cells = <1>;
        	        #size-cells = <1>;
                        ranges = <1 0 0 0x40000>;
                        clock-controller@88000000 {
                               compatible = "sirf,prima2-clkc";
                               reg = <0 0x1000>;
                        }

                        reset-controller@88010000 {
                               compatible = "sirf,prima2-rstc";

                        };
                }
        }

Probably yes. You should have a look if there are already bindings for
this that define other attributes. Also, if there is any customization
inside of the chip, you should have another more specific identifier
that makes it possible that this is the version that csr has modified.

sirf,prima2-video-codec is probably better than, but if anyone has other
suggestions, you could use something else.
