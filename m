Technically you are allowed to sleep if the MAY_SLEEP bit is set
but it's safe to just not sleep if that makes things easier for
you.

The enqueue/dequeue functions implement a software queue.  Typically
you would have a software queue in addition to whatever requests
you have in flight on the actual hardware.

For example, if your hardware is only able to handle one outstanding
request, then your software queue should only be dequeued once the
outstanding request has completed.
