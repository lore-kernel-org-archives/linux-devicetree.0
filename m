It is understood, but this does not mean we should merge this patchset,
actually it is the other way around. It was extremely complicated
to factor out some common CPUidle bits because of the prolification
of power down interfaces in arm/mach code, each with its quirks
du jour.

If we had a standard interface (that encompasses what all ARM mach code
power interfaces do, basically PSCI) when arm32 power management code
was being pushed upstream we would not have that power management arm/mach
code today.

PSCI is there to solve that problem, and it predates v8, there is no
reason to merge code that provides no added value (I am obviously
talking about the pseudo-boot protocol this patchset is enabling, not
the platforms themselves which we definitely want to support upstream,
with some preconditions that are equal for everyone) and to leverage
a legacy that does not exist for arm64.

Lorenzo
