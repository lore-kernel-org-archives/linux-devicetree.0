In general I'm concerned about the creation of a new language, even if
it is based on the DTS syntax. It forces us to define grammer that by
necessity will be simple at first just to get things working, but then
need to be extended to handle complex stuff. I've been researching ASN.1
and similar schema languages to see if we can adopt the structure if not
the syntax when writing schema files.

In the mean time I'm now feeling that we should go ahead with the
C-implementation of schema checking just to make some progress and then
migrate the logic out into separately parsed schema files when we have
something better. The low hanging fruit of course is the core bindings.
Interrupts, gpios, regs, clocks, common busses like spi, i2c & pci.

I think the most important thing to get settled now is determining how
we trigger schema checks. For example, given a random node in the tree,
how does the checker know to apply the interrupts and regs tests?

I'm wary of the template approach. I think schemas should be schemas,
and it should alwasy be possible for a schema to derive from any other
schema. For instance, a device binding will pull in the interrupt
consumer and reg core schemas. Also, a special purpose UART device
may use a simple extension of the ns16550 binding.

I guess my point is that templates shouldn't be a special case. All
bindings should be derivable, but what we do need is a mechanism to
constrain bindings. For example, the interrupts binding would describe
one or more interrupts in a list, but a given device may need to
constrain a minimum of 2 interrupts. For an initial C implementation that
could merely be a argument when invoking the binding test.

On the syntax, this feels very verbose. If we were to draw inspiration
from the ASN.1 syntax, we might do somehting like this:

FdtDevice ::= SET {
	interrupts FdtInterrupt (SIZE(1))
	reg FdtReg
}

FdtDevice is a type that makes use of the FdtReg and FdtInterrupt types.

Some bindings are just core, like interrupts. It would probablay be
better to just leave those in C even when we're happy with a schema
language.

It seems to me that what you're getting at is that a binding needs to
describe how it is matched (key attributes) and then the set of
constraints. That is a good start, but it feels to me like the matching
isn't very well defined yet. We need some pretty firm rules about how
the checker know when it can apply rules, and those rules will change
depending on where in the tree you are. For example, the cpus schema
only is applicable under the /cpus node, and device nodes with
compatible properties should only match on nodes that are under bus
nodes. (there's another issue of checking for nodes placed where they
shouldn't be, but I'll leave that aside for now).

Also the key properties or matching criteria will not be present for
some bindings because they are only ever directly instantiated. ie. the
interrupts binding doesn't stand on its own, it is only ever called out
to by another binding. (I know, you've addressed some of this above, but
I'm working through a though process).

As we talked about on the call today, if we can hammer out how the
schemas will get selected at test time, then we can start to implement a
hybrid approach where core stuff is implemented in C code and schema
files can instantiate the core bindings as needed.
