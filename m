Marvell Berlin4CT is a SoC based on 64bit ARMv8 architecture. It contains
quad CA53 cores.

This SoC shares many HW IP with BG2Q and other berlin series. This patchset
was tested on Berlin4CT DMP board, and boot to shell ok.

Since v4:
 - rebased on the latest next tree
 - adopt Sebastian suggestions such as: move osc out of "/soc" node, use
   "Marvell BG4CT DMP board" as model, etc.
 - use correct memory size for BG4CT DMP. The total DDR size is 2GB, we start
   from 0x01000000, so the avaiable linux memory should be 0x7f000000.

Since v3:
 - remove bootargs. follow the same behavior as other arm64 SoCs.

Since v2:
 - remove the memreserve which isn't removed by mistake
 - add earlycon to enable earlyconsole, inspired by Sudeep

Since v1:
 - remove "earlyprintk" bootargs which doesn't work on arm64
 - fix GICC_DIR size as pointed out by Mark
 - define memory start address instead of memory reservation as suggested by Mark
 - add interrupt-affinity to pmu node as pointed out by Sudeep
