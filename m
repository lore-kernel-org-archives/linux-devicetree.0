Hi Maxime

Thanks for the review. I will send a PATCH v6 soon.

I will fix it.

Now I am glad to delete it.

good point I did.

I don't understand you, because, v5 file compiled for me. Here is output 
from running system, just the relevant part.  using dtc -I fs 
/proc/device-tree

ext_rgmii_phy = "/soc/ethernet@1c30000/mdio/ethernet-phy@7";

ethernet@1c30000 {
	mdio {
	..
		ethernet-phy@7 {
			compatible = "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
			phandle = <0x1c>;
			reg = <0x7>;
			linux,phandle = <0x1c>;
		};
};

Is this what you expect?

boot_device is deleted. A u-boot property got mixed up in kernel DT.

would you prefer no comment or a rewrite? How does this look?

/*
 * AMPAK AP6212A WiFi module with BCM43430, rev=1 inside
 * sdio vendor ID: 0x02d0, sdio device ID: 0xa9a6
 */

I am afraid a casual reader would think "brcm,bcm4329-fmac" is wrong, 
because that is not the actual chip inside the module.

drive-strength and the node mmc2_8bit_pins are gone. When I removed it 
drive-strength = <0x1e>;  seems the default. And eMMC seems to work when 
booting from Micro SD.

NOTE: the  40mA came from a vresion of vendor's old dts file and I also 
noticed the same value is used in other dts in kernel e.g 
sun8i-h3-orangepi-plus.dts, sun9i-a80-cubieboard4.dts
It could be a copy paste error or those boards need it. Anyway I removed it.

good, deleteed.

&pio { } and gmac_power_pin_nanopi{} are deleted.
along with
pinctrl-0 = <&gmac_power_pin_nanopi>;

deleted wifi_en_npi.

good point. I don't see an ID-detect connected in the schematic. The 
previous generation had. 

I will leave 
&usb_otg {
  dr_mode = "host";
  status = "okay";
};

&usbphy {
	/* USB Type-A ports' VBUS is always on */
	status = "okay";
};

Wow, a nice cleanup.

I am surprised defaults works well and thanks for pointing these out.
