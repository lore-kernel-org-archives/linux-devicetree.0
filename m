Sounds reasonable

My thinking was that each driver that permitted execution of these
register write sequences on its registers would provide an extremely
simple driver to support this. Perhaps just one "op" function that
implemented each write, and took care of details such as timing delays
for the IO, indexed addressing, using I2C instead of memory-mapped,
perhaps register access width, etc.

Some of the items in the list above could be solved by explicit flags in
the data instead (register access width comes to mind for memory-mapped
devices at least).

Do you have any direct pointers to how OF and ACPI solved this kind of
thing; it'd be good background.
