I'll second what Kevin said.

I guess the regulator suspend handling [0] is one of the requirements, but I'd 
think there is more. And while Doug had a quite long list of suspend-related 
patches in his try, for now we'll need the minimal set to enable this series 
to sucessfully wake the system again after going to suspend.
