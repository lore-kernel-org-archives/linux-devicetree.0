I think this feature is so broken that any attempt to use it is going to
cause problems.  Even if you somehow manage to make something that holds
together in your test system I'm not convinced it's going to be safe for
other users.

I really think this is something that the user needs to carry out of
tree, it seems clear that that enbling interrupts is very disruptive.

That's fine, some other drivers do this for things that don't have
interrupts or don't have usable interrupts.
