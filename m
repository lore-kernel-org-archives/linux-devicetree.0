Hello Ji=C5=99=C3=AD,

=46irst of all, please try to use git format-patch when submitting a
patch to any kernel mailing list.

The policy is to leave pins in an unknown state till some peripheral
need them.

What are you trying to use this pin for ?
If you just want to use it as a chip select for an spi device, take a
look at [1].

Here the gpio is requested by the spi core when defining the cs-gpios
property. The gpio controller then request the listed pins to the pin
controller (pinctrl driver).

You can explicitly define a new pinctrl state (by defining a new
pinctrl_spi0_cs0 subnode in your dts file) and reference it in the
spi0 node, though this is not mandatory.

Best Regards,

Boris
