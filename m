So we're kind of creating a binding that mirrors the gpio bindings
(*-gpios) which is a bit of an oddball as all other bindings have gone
with a fixed property name and then a *-names property to name them.
The main downside to this form is a prefixed property name is harder
to parse and validate. So perhaps we should follow the more common
pattern, but we're not really describing a h/w connection just an
association. And now we also have the trigger source binding to
associate LEDs with device nodes, so perhaps that should be used here.
We shouldn't really have 2 ways to associate things in DT even if how
that gets handled in the kernel is different.
