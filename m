for ACPI it is really suppose to be unique. Do you happen to have a link =
for a good download of the latest Broadcom firmware?

I am not in favor of it. I prefer giving the vendor the chance to list =
the right firmware for their hardware instead of us guessing. Whatever =
comes out of the Broadcom Windows driver should be all least passed =
certification.

Seems that Broadcom opted for per ACPI HID firmware files. This is in =
contrast to Intel for example where we read hardware information and =
pick the firmware based on that information.
