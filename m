Right, which provides a path towards a slightly more sane ABI.  If we
choose to implement this, or another variant, we get to shape a
migration path towards an ABI we designed.  As opposed to locked in to
one we didn't even see coming.

As I see it (and perhaps this suffers from my limited view of the
embedded space, eg fairly marvell-specific), there are two scenarios:

1) The end goal:  bootloaders load a single DTB from a chunk of flash
and pass it off to the kernel/next stage, whatever.  Either there is no
filename, just a flash partition, or the vendor has chosen some dtb
naming scheme suitable for their needs, eg OMAP SoCs pulling the
bootloader from an SD card would need to name the dtb contained on the
same SD card. board.dtb?  I'm assuming here that the SD card files are
board specific (x-loader, uboot, env, dtb)

2) right now: distributions are creating utilities, such a flash-kernel
in Debian, that pick from a slew of dtbs, append it to the zImage, and
create the uImage.  The bootloaders in these installs don't have support
for fdt.

Our problem (as I see it) is that #2 is creating an ABI out of something
we never realized would become an ABI, the filenames created by 'make
dtbs'.

And since the dtb name is derived directly from the dts name, we're
getting locked into a bunch of filenames that are less than ideal
because we didn't know what we didn't know when we started this two+
years ago.

Why does the bootloader have to choose?  Is this a development scenario or
a deployed scenario?

fyi:  https://github.com/zonque/pxa-impedance-matcher.git

I agree, but it's not.  Hence the patch.

We can't, you'll get collisions.  In my globalscale,mirabox.dtb example,
the next string is 'marvell,armada370'.  That matches many boards which
_aren't_ compatible with the globalscale,mirabox.dtb.

We've seen this as well with a couple of boards.

I disagree here.  I don't think this decision/discovery process should
be done by the bootloader.  It should be done by the distribution
installer/firmware upgrade utility.  The risk of breaking boot is too
high.

At least during installer/upgrade the distro has the opportunity to
query the user, "Hey, this used to have nvidia,tegra30-cardhu.dtb, but
now I need to choose between nvidia,tegra30-cardhu-a02.dtb and
nvidia,tegra30-cardhu-a04.dtb.  Please see
http://wiki.mydistro.org/devicetree/upgrade/nvidia,tegra30-cardhu for
howto determine which variant matches your board."

Ideally, there would be programmatic way for the upgrader to determine
which variant it is on, but failing that, it could fall back to the
above.

thx,

Jason.
