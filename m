I _think_ this will be less of a problem in practice than it could be
in theory.

The reason this is needed is that at least several platforms have
different baudrate settings in firmware than the default provided by
the kernel for their UART. As a result, stdout-path becomes
semi-useless; the only thing it gives you is the ability to get
earlycon output without specifying a specific device (and then the
console turns to garbage once non-earlycon is enabled).

Hence, a platform that gets along happily today without the ability to
specify console options in stdout-path would have no pressing need to
add it to its dt. This should permit at least a very long, soft,
transition path.

(console= on kernel command line continues to override stdout-path.)

_That_ would be most unfortunate.

My preference would be not, given the above, but the important thing
is to get the functionality in so we get rid of mandatory console=.
