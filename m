Correct - all board designs that include this dtsi file follow such 
commonality (ie. design with SATA0 first, etc).  By having common board 
designs it allows for commonality in dts files rather than duplicating 
information everywhere.  If somebody designs a bizarro board they are 
free to create their own dts file of course.

The use of a define to specify the number of SATA ports in the board 
design meets our requirements of being able to maintain many boards.  We 
need a method to specify the number of ports in the board design rather 
than copying and pasting the information in many dts files.  If you have 
an alternative upstreamable mechanism to manage the configuration of 
many boards without copy and paste that would be ideal?
