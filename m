I see this pattern used frequently in the blackfin tree.  Is there a way
to achieve this without breaking configuration?

Can you give me more information on it?  Currently, it looks like most
boards use a 24 MHz clock, judging from this comment in
mach-imx/clk-imx6q.c:

        /*
         * Let's initially set up CLKO with OSC24M, since this configuration
         * is widely used by imx6q board designs to clock audio codec.
         */

This codec requires the more unusual 22.5792 MHz clock.  What is the
appropriate method of obtaining this particular frequency?

Not all codecs have power supplies.  Most don't, in fact, it's just this
board where a switch was added to reset the codec in case it gets
wedged.  Boards might use this codec but omit the power switch to save
cost, because they are confident the codec won't get stuck, in which
case they would be forced to use a dummy regulator.

Additionally, since the regulator is external to the codec (as it
physically cuts 3.3V from the power supply), it doesn't make sense to
put it in the codec driver.
