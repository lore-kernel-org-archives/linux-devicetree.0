Can you stop that insults nonsense?

Hmm. But you did not present any alternative. Seems some hardware is
simply complex. So either we don't add complex drivers (_that_ would
be a mistake), or some userspace solution will need to be
done. Shell-script running media-ctl does not seem that hard.

Complex hardware sometimes requires userspace configuration. Running a
shell script on startup does not seem that hard.

And maybe we could do some kind of default setup in kernel, but that
does not really solve the problem.
