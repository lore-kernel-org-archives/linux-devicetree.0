Agreed.

You are right.  Changing to SOC_SINGLE.

130ms delay is added to remove pop noise during stopping audio playback.
You are right that it is not just muting, but part of stopping audio playback.
I am moving this sequence as part of DAPM.

Will fix.

OK.

OK.  Seperating into 4 individual files, with each containing impedance for DC
Left, Right, and AC Left, Right.

OK, removing from DT.

OK, adding additional IDs for I2C and DT.
