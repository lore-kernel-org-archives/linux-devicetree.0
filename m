I will.

The "target = <&foo>" syntax is the internal dtb syntax that the kernel
expects.  The plan is to hide this internal format so it is not visble
at the source level, but that will require some more changes to the dtc
compiler.

Yes, the kernel support for overlays is not complete.  This is one of
the issues that has not been addressed yet.

I don't have the rpi-3 documentation handy, so I'm going to take a wild
guess that the &i2c1 and &gpio node changes that you need are for
hardware on a hat.  If so, the plan for the kernel is to describe
the signals available via the hat connectors in the device tree and
then make those signals available through the connector node instead
of having the hat overlay directly reference the signal node.  The
connector abstraction has been discussed but is not implemented.
