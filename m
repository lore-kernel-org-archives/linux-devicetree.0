In drivers/amba/bus.c:

static int amba_get_enable_pclk(struct amba_device *pcdev)
{
	struct clk *pclk = clk_get(&pcdev->dev, "apb_pclk");

static int amba_get_enable_vcore(struct amba_device *pcdev)
{
	struct regulator *vcore = regulator_get(&pcdev->dev, "vcore");

So users of this bus have to have a clock and a regulator with those
exact names.
Is it your expectation that the clock/regulator names are standardized
across arch/arm?

And a little grepping suggests that almost all of the machines that
possibly use
this don't do anything useful with it (just implementing duplicated
dummy code
so that "apb_pclk" has something to refer to).

My thinking (at least with respect to these) was that clock sources and
regulators could
be represented by nodes in the device tree and if a device required a
particular clock
source to be enabled that it would declare that in the device tree.
This would enable
reusing the existing etb driver (more or less) in a device tree platform
(mach-zynq).
Basically, it seems to me that if amba_bus does something useful, then
its utility should
be generalized into the generic platform_bus, which would enable it to
be used with
device trees, rather than building device tree specific code to enable
amba_bus.

Note that for arch/arm/kernel/etm.c, there is apparently another clock
that *isn't* handled by amba_bus
that it manages internally:

 	t->emu_clk = clk_get(&dev->dev, "emu_src_ck");
 	if (IS_ERR(t->emu_clk)) {
 		dev_dbg(&dev->dev, "Failed to obtain emu_src_ck.\n");
 		ret = -EFAULT;
		goto out;
 	}

This could be handled automatically by a more general abstraction of the
clock dependencies
of an arbitrary driver.

I guess I was assuming that it would happen automatically in whatever
generic code would understand
the clocks and regulators in the first place?  (Note that I'm *NOT*
suggesting that the
driver be responsible for the things above, which seem to be
'fundamental infrastructure' 
things.)  I'm suggesting a way of reducing the amount of extra
machine-specific code,
while doing more or less what amba_bus does today.

The *other* thing that amba_bus does is validate the peripheral_id,
which seems to me to
be something that a driver could perhaps do for itself by calling a
validation function
in probe() rather than bothering to export it top amba_bus?

Forgive me if these are stupid questions, but I'm trying hard to figure
out to use the
driver code that is there without adding a bunch of new (duplicated, do
nothing)
machine-specific code to meet the assumptions of amba_bus.
