The first step is the conversion from 'sys_device' to 'device', which is here:
  http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/kay/patches.git;a=tree

That should hit the tree soon, if all works according to plan. All
sys_devices and sysdev classes will be gone for forever.

The 'class' to 'bus' work is simpler, because the logic in both of
them is very similar and both use the same 'struct device' already.

We'll need to add some convenience APIs to bus, and add code to make
sure the converted stuff has compat symlinks in /sys/class when
needed. Then we can convert-over one 'struct class' to 'struct
bus_type' after the other until 'struct class' can be deleted.

This work has not yet started, because we are busy with the sys_device
stuff at the moment.

No new stuff should use 'struct class' or 'struct sys_device', they
should all start right away with 'struct bus_type'.
