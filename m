If they're just sharing the interrupt, why are they not separate nodes (and
drivers) which simply happen to share an interrupt?

Is there anything else shared?

Depending on my prior question, I'm not sure that's necessarily true. If
there's no actual shared SoC PMU logic as such, the names below for each
individual PMU seem fine.

Sure, but is this simply informative for the user, or does this have an impact
on the programming model?

Thanks,
