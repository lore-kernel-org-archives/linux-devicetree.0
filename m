Correct. Based on response from our ASIC team, on Northstar, 1) we
cannot distinguish between various external imprecise aborts; 2) nor can
we use the internal PCIe controller register to disable unsupported
request from being forwarded as APB bus error (and therefore causes the
abort).

All subsequent iProc SoCs can disable this error forwarding from the
iProc PCIe controller.

Correct, one possible solution is to only ignoring the aborts during
condiguration space register access of an endpoint device. Below is the
logic how I only disable the APB bus error forwarding during these
accesses (for all other iProc SoCs):

+/**
+ * APB error forwarding can be disabled during access of configuration
+ * registers of the endpoint device, to prevent unsupported requests
+ * (typically seen during enumeration with multi-function devices) from
+ * triggering a system exception
+ */
+static inline void iproc_pcie_apb_err_disable(struct pci_bus *bus,
+					      bool disable)
+{
+	struct iproc_pcie *pcie = iproc_data(bus);
+	u32 val;
+
+	if (bus->number && pcie->has_apb_err_disable) {
+		val = iproc_pcie_read_reg(pcie, IPROC_PCIE_APB_ERR_EN);
+		if (disable)
+			val &= ~APB_ERR_EN;
+		else
+			val |= APB_ERR_EN;
+		iproc_pcie_write_reg(pcie, IPROC_PCIE_APB_ERR_EN, val);
+	}
+}
+
[...]
+static int iproc_pcie_config_read32(struct pci_bus *bus, unsigned int
devfn,
+				    int where, int size, u32 *val)
+{
+	int ret;
+
+	iproc_pcie_apb_err_disable(bus, true);
+	ret = pci_generic_config_read32(bus, devfn, where, size, val);
+	iproc_pcie_apb_err_disable(bus, false);
+
+	return ret;
+}
+
+static int iproc_pcie_config_write32(struct pci_bus *bus, unsigned int
devfn,
+				     int where, int size, u32 val)
+{
+	int ret;
+
+	iproc_pcie_apb_err_disable(bus, true);
+	ret = pci_generic_config_write32(bus, devfn, where, size, val);
+	iproc_pcie_apb_err_disable(bus, false);
+
+	return ret;
+}
+
 static struct pci_ops iproc_pcie_ops = {
 	.map_bus = iproc_pcie_map_cfg_bus,
-	.read = pci_generic_config_read32,
-	.write = pci_generic_config_write32,
+	.read = iproc_pcie_config_read32,
+	.write = iproc_pcie_config_write32,
 };

I agree with that option 3 is probably the best solution for now, from a
distribution's perspective.

Thanks,
