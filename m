Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt:

  Note:
	select should be used with care. select will force
	a symbol to a value without visiting the dependencies.
	By abusing select you are able to select a symbol FOO even
	if FOO depends on BAR that is not set.
	In general use select only for non-visible symbols
	(no prompts anywhere) and for symbols with no dependencies.
	That will limit the usefulness but on the other hand avoid
	the illegal configurations all over.

People tend to abuse select because it's "convenient". If you depend,
but some of your dependencies aren't met, you're in for some digging
through Kconfig to find the missing deps. Just to make the option you
want visible in menuconfig. If you instead select something with
dependencies, it'll be right most of the time, and it's "convenient",
until it breaks. (And hey, it usually breaks for someone else with some
other config, so it's still convenient for you.)

Perhaps kconfig should complain about selecting visible symbols and
symbols with dependencies.


BR,
Jani.
