Hi,

I'm quite sure the registers are good for meson6 actually, and
it seems reasonable Amlogic made the HW evolve for the Meson8 and GXBB platforms.

Since we are using devicetree, the correct way to achieve this fix is not
to drop support for meson6 (what you do) but add a logic to select the correct
register for meson8 and gxbb if their compatible string are encountered.

I made this fix already but lacked time to actually test it on HW :
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/compare/master...superna9999:amlogic/v4.7/ir

My patch is missing the meson8b support, and may need a supplementary compatible check or
a separate dt match table.

PS: BTW could you format the cover letter using the git format-patch --cover-letter instead and
add the v2 using the -subject-prefix like :
# git format-patch --cover-letter --signoff --subject-prefix "PATCH v2" -2
