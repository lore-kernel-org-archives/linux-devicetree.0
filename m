I'm not sure what you're suggesting as an alternative to a reset
subsystem (or API if you want something that sounds smaller!) :-)

It is indeed probably common that there's a 1:1 mapping between IP
blocks and struct device. However, I'm sure there are plenty of
counter-examples; IP blocks with multiple reset domains (hence struct
devices that encompass multiple reset domains, or reset domains that
encompass multiple struct devices), just as there are many examples of
non-1:1 mappings between struct device and struct clk.

Even ignoring that, we'd still need to API say device_reset(struct
device *dev) or device_reset(struct device *dev, const char *conid)
wouldn't we? That's really all I meant by a reset subsystem.

An alternative here would be to simply move Tegra's
tegra_periph_reset_{de,}assert() function prototypes into a header in
include/linux rather than mach-tegra/include/mach. However, I imagine at
least some other SoC needs a similar API, so a common API might be useful?
