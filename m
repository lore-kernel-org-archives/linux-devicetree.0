v2:  separate into 2 documents for the 2 drivers
v12: bump version to line up with simple-fpga-bus version
     remove Linux specific notes such as references to sysfs
     move non-DT specific documentation elsewhere
     remove bindings that would have been used to pass configuration
     clean up formatting
v13: Remove 'label' property
     Change property from init-val to bridge-enable
     Fix email address
v14: Add resets
     Change order of bridges to put lw bridge (controlling bridge) first
v15: No change in this patch for v15 of this patch set
v16: Added regs property, cleaned up unit addresses
v17: No change to this patch in v17 of patch set
v18: Changed to not need reset-names property
     node names as fpga-bridge@...
     labels as fpga_bridge
     Add address of fpgaportrst to give and address for f2s bridge
