I still don't understand. There is already such cases in the Cubox:
the S/PDIF output from the kirkwood audio controller is connected to
both the HDMI transmitter and the S/PDIF TOSLINK. So, in the audio
controller, the port @1 defines the S/PDIF DAI and the endpoints @0 and
@1 point to the remote DAIs, creating 2 snd DAI links:

	port@1 {
		audio_hdmi_spdif: endpoint@0 {
			remote-endpoint =3D <&hdmi_spdif_audio>;
		};
		audio_spdif: endpoint@1 {
			remote-endpoint =3D <&spdif_audio>;
		};
	};

in the snd card:

	- DAI link 1 =3D 'audio controller spdif out' <=3D> 'hdmi spdif'
	- DAI link 2 =3D 'audio controller spdif out' <=3D> 'spdif'

If I am wrong, may you give us an example for which such a DT would not
work?
