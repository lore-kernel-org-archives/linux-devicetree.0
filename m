I think all the comments I made on probe() for the main bcm2835 clock
driver likely apply here too.

Also, is it "legal" for clock drivers to use __clk_get_name()? I thought
that was a clock core internal function, but may be wrong. I would have
expected to be able to pass a clock object when registering clocks
rather than a clock name, but oh well.

BTW, I like how this series shows how useful it is for someone with full
knowledge of the HW to come up with the DT bindings for a HW module;
once you know how the HW is actually designed, the correct binding ends
up being a lot easier to come up with, rather than guessing:-)
