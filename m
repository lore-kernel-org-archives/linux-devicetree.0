Are these the only two that will ever be supported for
ti,k2g-message-manager or there can be more in the future? You did
mention about 11 possible valid qid_pid values for the ARM, and the
driver match data is
registering all of those mboxes.

Yeah, this will also work. I am fine with this approach - my only
concern was that the probe doesn't have to go parsing all the nodes to
be able to register the mailbox channels with the mailbox core. Since
you are registering them using match data, that is not a concern anymore.

Anyway, will let Rob give the final ACK.
