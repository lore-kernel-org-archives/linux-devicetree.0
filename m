We have internal versions of most everything.  It's a matter of getting 
people to push the appropriate patches out for upstream version to work.
Please contact the bcm-kernel-feedback list with issues and we can work 
through common solution (or, likely already have a solution just not 
upstreamed).

Again - we may have internal solution already.  Yes, mailbox was 
submitted upstream a long time ago and I think got stalled being 
accepted upstream.  We can work through upstream solution by starting 
with sending to bcm-kernel-feedback-list to discuss details.

I understand the difficulty you would have if you're trying to work with 
a different kernel version in our release.  If you send me a list 
directly of the drivers you use in Cygnus that will help me get those 
changes prioritized to be pushed upstream.  And/or we can work together 
on that.
