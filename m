True. I can drop the generic "ti,message-manager" binding.

phandle -> I think Suman has already explained in his response.

This is SoC integration dependent -> Every queue, proxy combination
has it's own memory region allocated for it.

This is primarily to ensure a future compatibility where we are trying
to convince the hardware team to provide an error interrupt per queue
as well for slave usage.
it would probably be pointless at that time to deal with "legacy"
binding defintions when the next hardware ip definition takes place.

I see that Suman has already responded to this.
