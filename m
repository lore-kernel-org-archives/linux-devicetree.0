Hi Arnd,

Thanks for taking a look at this.

Good question. I can drop it, but would like to keep in case we need to
extend it in future. We can always use then to identify.

Ah right, I didn't notice that. I will add it. It was added to provide
the protocol number in "reg" property.

I am not sure if I follow you here. But generally shmem can be memory
carved out of anything in the system and it's dependent on the protocol
and the remote firmware rather than the mailbox hardware itself.

Yes it depends on #clock-cells property. That's the main reason for
adding #clock-cells
