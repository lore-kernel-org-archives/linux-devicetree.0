I think this is very good in general, but in some cases should be reworded
for clarity, and in a few others we should remove the special cases from
the binding and try to treat them more like the common case.

I thought they are compatible with all older ones at the register level,
as long as we describe all the differences in the ranges property
and other properties.

I think you should also list #address-cells=<2> and #size-cells=<1>
as required here, as long as an optional "ranges" property.

I think it makes sense to describe the "ranges" format here,
even if we expect the property to be empty at boot time and
only filled at run-time.

I think I'm a bit lost here. Is the "soc" node in this example the node
that is described as compatible="marvell,armada370-mbus"? Maybe expand
the example a little here to clarify this.

If you use the new preprocessor feature we have in DT now, you can
actually list a macro that is used to assembly the cell from target
and attribute ID.

I would not describe it as "fictious" here, rather an as "defined". This
binding is what turns the fiction into a reality ;-)

The part about "inheriting" is not clear. Also, this is not written more
like a blog post than a specification ;-)

I think the key here is not to avoid duplication but to allow flexibility.
I would write this as:

The mappings in the mbus device are expected to be dynamically created by
the operating system at boot time, or a later point. Since the ranges property
in the mbus device must match the actual mappings, it is also expected
to be filled out dynamically. A boot loader may set up mappings before
loading the operating system and describe them in the ranges property.

The example should also contain an #address-cells and #size-cells
property in the devbus-bootcs, as those are required for interpreting the
ranges property.

I would leave out here what the driver does, or say that the mbus driver "may"
skip them. For the purpose of this specification, it does not matter whether
the driver leaves the translation in place or changes it.

I don't understand the part about zeroing a windowid. Is "target = 0x0,
attribute = 0x0" the actual setting for the internal registers? If so,
don't call it a dummy translation or a special case.
If not, why not use the actual setting here?

Again, I don't understand this part. For the purpose of specification, I
would not make a special case here. It is not a hardware property that makes
these special but the way we use it from Linux. Consequently I would suggest
we skip the PCI ranges in the initial boot time setup by identifying the
pcie-controller node by its "compatible" property.
