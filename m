Yeah, we discussed this internally and some ones where not too excited
about such new properties, so I tried implementation of the bindings which
Grant initially suggested.
Having separate properties like these has an advantage though that the
clocks configuration specification is separated and not mixed with
regular clock properties describing solely the clock connections.

OK, I'm going to prepare new version of this series with the altered
DT binding.
