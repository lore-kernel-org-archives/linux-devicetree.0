No, there is no known difference between 1G and 2G except doubled RAM.
I'll squash the two back into a single non-ES dts.

About the board specific compatibles, I am not so sure if we should
keep them at all. "solidrun,cubox" for all three variants should be
enough. checkpatch is already choking on every unknown compatible it
sees and documenting each individual board clearly doesn't scale well.

Hmm, I guess those who have it know about ES=="Engineering Sample" but
as I have to do a v2 anyway, I'll fix it up.

Thanks!
