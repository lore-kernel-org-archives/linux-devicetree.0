Not only is that not clear it's also not clear that we intentionally
handle the case where they don't match by falling through - missing
default cases just look like bugs.  Tweaking the comment helps a bit the
reader will still see a pattern that usually looks like a bug and need
to think about if it's OK, a default case means it's clear that it is OK.

You should really manage all the supplies.

I don't think that restriction on the part of the clock API is
reasonable TBH, you need to be able to tell what the clock is doing
before turning it on so you don't misdrive the part.  I suspect that
it'll do the right thing almost all the time anyway...
