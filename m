Just say:

What's this needed for?

This isn't probeable or well-known?

Surely for a given revision of the chip these offsets are known? i.e.
surely the compatible string implies specific offsets?

Huh?

What's a bank? Surely they have separate instances of the PMU?

What order are these in?

Huh?

Likewise, surely this is well-known for a given revision of the chip?

Same comments as for the L3 cache nodes

Why is this necessary?

Thanks,
