Well, I understand you concern, but if you read carefully the old and
new drivers, you'll notice that they are completely different (the only
thing I kept are the macro definitions).
I really tried to adapt the existing driver to add the missing
features (especially the support for TDMA), but all my attempts
ended up introducing hackish code (not even talking about the
performance penalty of this approach). Is that really what we want ?
How would you make such big changes on the existing driver (I mean, the
core infrastructure dealing with crypto requests is completely
different) ?

I have another solution though: keep the existing driver for old
marvell SoCs (orion, kirkwood and dove), and add a new one for modern
SoCs (armada 370, XP, 375 and 38x), so that users of the mv_cesa driver
won't have to audit the new code.

Thanks for the pointers.
