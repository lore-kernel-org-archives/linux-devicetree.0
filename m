Hi,

This series modifies the device tree binding of the clock of the AP806
part that we find in the Marvell Armada 7K/8K SoCs.

As for the previsous series the only change in this second version is
about the binding documentation: all the documentation related changes
are now move in their own patches. It allows to provide a stable -dt
branch for theses changes. I also added the acked-by from Rob Herring.

Here again the last two patches modifying the device tree _must_ be
merged through the mvebu tree to avoid future conflict.

For the record:
As for the CP110, we want to be able to ease the integration of new
clocks without breaking the backward compatibility. It is done in
patch 3.

We also want to ease the integration of the pinctrl node in the device
tree. It is the purpose of the patch 5.

In this series (as in the previous one for CP110), even if there is
some change in the device tree binding we paid attention to the
backward compatibility, and the driver can still work with the old
device tree.

Thanks,

Gregory
