Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Mailbox: Provide support STi based platforms

ST's platforms currently support a maximum of 5 Mailboxes, one for
each of the supported co-processors situated on the platform.  Each
Mailbox is divided up into 4 instances which consist of 32 channels.
Messages are passed between the application and co-processors using
shared memory areas.

Also included in the set is an example Client which should be generic
enough to use as a testing environment for all Mailbox IPs which use
shared memory to pass messages.  With a small change, it should also
be able to test more extravagant implementations too.

Lee Jones (6):
  mailbox: dt: Supply bindings for ST's Mailbox IP
  mailbox: dt-bindings: Add shared [driver <=> device tree] defines
  mailbox: Add support for ST's Mailbox IP
  ARM: STi: stih407-family: Add nodes for Mailbox
  mailbox: Add generic mechanism for testing Mailbox Controllers
  ARM: STi: DT: STiH407: Enable Mailbox testing facility
