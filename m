Russell replied already on the meaning of this variable, so I don't
think its type is relevant here. It is also used when calling
dma_contiguous_reserve() which takes a phys_addr_t.

sizeof(dma_addr_t) <= sizeof(phys_addr_t). I had this discussion with
Russell when upstreaming the LPAE patches and the conclusion was that
while the phys_addr_t is 64-bit with LPAE, the dma_addr_t size is a
feature of the SoC and must be selected independently. However, I think
with multi-platform support and LPAE enabled, we should probably set the
dma_addr_t to 64-bit.

arm_dma_limit should be phys_addr_t since this is an address as seen by
the CPU. dma_addr_t OTOH is a bus address as seen by the device. You can
in theory have a DMA buffer with physical address beyond 32-bit (from a
CPU perspective) but with a bus address withing 32-bit as seen by the
device.

There is some confusion in the kernel (you can google for past
discussions) around the meaning of the DMA mask. If your RAM starts at
0, it doesn't matter much and there are several such assumptions in the
kernel.

So I still consider that you should use #ifdef
CONFIG_ARCH_DMA_ADDR_T_64BIT and select this option on your platform.
