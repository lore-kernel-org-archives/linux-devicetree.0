It depends, "clocks" property here just simply shows which clock group
the clock's parents are in.
The detailed dependency relationship (i.e. how many parents and which
are the parents) are implemented in driver code.

Ok, I should address more, will do in the next version.

The pmu-gate is actually a clock independent from the 'pmu_apb' syscon
device, using a reference to syscon node instead of a reg property is
just to avoid mapping the same address areas repeatedly.  Spreadtrum's
clock h/w design is a little complicated, after discussing with Arnd
and Stephen, I then chose to implement in this way.

I guess the name of 'pmu_apb' might be confused, it's actually not a
bus, but a global address area stored a lot of registers shared by a
few devices including some clocks.  I think I'd better use another
name instead of pmu_apb :)

Please let me know if I'm missing something here.

Thanks,
Chunyan
