Given the minor differences between ES and production, instead of

dove-cubox-common.dtsi
+--> dove-cubox.dts (production)
+--> dove-cubos-es.dts (engineering sample)

we could also just have an "overlay" for the ES like

dove-cubox.dts (production)
+--> dove-cubox-es.dts (engineering sample)

It is not used commonly until now, maybe just a matter of taste.

Is there any version you prefer?
