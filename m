On TI's Keystone platforms, several peripherals such as the
gbe ethernet switch, 10gbe ethernet switch and PCIe controller
require the use of a SerDes for converting SoC parallel data into
serialized data that can be output over a high-speed electrical
interface, and also converting high-speed serial input data
into parallel data that can be processed by the SoC.  The
SerDeses used by those peripherals, though they may be different,
are largely similar in functionality and setup.

This patch series provides a SerDes phy driver implementation that can be
used by the above mentioned peripheral drivers to configure their
respective SerDeses.

As an example of the using the SerDes driver, this patch series also
updates the Keystone PCIe host driver to enable and use its SerDes block.

v3:
	- addresses the following review comments
		1. https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/19/756
			-- included sizes.h
		2. https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/19/781
			-- updated base on Fengguang Wu's suggestions.
		3. https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/15/896
			-- clarified here https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/20/512
			-- nothing to do.

v2:
	- addresses the following review comments on v1:
		1. https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/10/15/896
			-- this does not address the question:
			   "The current code does not do this when compiled,
			    which might be a problem for distributors.
			    Can you clarify the license?"
			-- the question is still under discussion here:
