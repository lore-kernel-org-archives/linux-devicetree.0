Yep, I made some measurements using tcrypt a while ago, I'll provide
them in the next round.

I checked it too: it should work, but I don't have any board to test
it :-/.

I agree for the 2 steps operation:
- add new driver code without compiling it
- remove old code, update Kconfig (add new dependencies) and Makefile
  entries (compile the code in marvell/ instead of mv_cesa.c)

Is there a good reason for separating the core, TDMA and algorithms
support in different patches (keep Arnaud's authorship ?) ?
Anyway, this should be feasible, but I thought the policy was to
minimize the number of patches when submitting new drivers.

No problem (thanks for the offer).

Best Regards,
