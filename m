*Please* also try to be a bit more concise and focused, this mail is
very long and verbose for the amount of content in it.  As I said in my
previous e-mail please review the previous extensive discussions on
these topics and avoid going over old ground, similiarly like I said if
you want to work on making things more generic that's great but please
work with the people doing this already.

Endlessly going over old ground and starting from scratch is not going
to help move anything forward.

Picking a consistent name for this might be nice, yes.  Feel free to
send patches...

I don't think bikeshedding the name is a worthwhile activity. =20

If you want to convert it into an array you're adding substantial
complication to both defining the link and the software required to
support it, it's definitely specialist hardware time and there's a lot
of ways that cat can be skinned.

To repeat yet again, if this concerns you please work with Morimoto-san
on his generic card driver.  There are some code differences with clock
setup for the devices which are encoded in the board definitions as
well, plus the external connections.

I don't think anyone is happy with the audmux code but nobody has much
interest in spending the time and effort on it so we're stuck just
typing the data in statically.  If the situation improves we can always
just ignore the properties in future.

That's not what's going on here, let me once again ask you to review the
previous discussion on device tree bindings and make sure that you
understand the needs of advanced audio hardware.

So submit patches changing people's model names in the DTSs for the
affected boards to be something you find more pleasing...  that's what
they're there for.  I imagine that the people using these boards aren't
using UIs that present the names to the user and hence didn't care.

In any case this doesn't seem to be anything to do with the device tree
bindings, if you want to complain about specific DTS files go and talk
to them.

That's not going to scale well to boards that have inter CODEC analogue
links, we'd need a node for every single thing that could be a source
and sink on every device which seems tedious.

No, you've not understood what these are.  They are not the pads on the
CODEC (as you can tell from the fact that the routing map connects the
pads on the CODEC to them...), they are external things on the boards
like transducers or jacks.

Feel free to send patches for the documentation if you feel that the
documentation is not adequate for your needs.  Again I don't think it's
terribly useful to spend much time bikeshedding the names, improving the
documentation and adding a set of standard names that seem useful might
be worthwhile.

There are patches on the list to add device tree bindings to it, which
he's got precious little feedback on - this one e-mail from you is far
more feedback by volume than he's had up until now.

We can't, one of the problems with this stuff is that clocking design
(especially for the advanced use cases) is not as simple or general as
one might desire for a bunch of totally sensible electrical engineering
and system design reasons.  When we get to the point of deploying simple
card widely it's just typing to define a standard constant that everyone
can use for whatever the default sensible clocks are, and of course
people working on simple card can do that as they're going.

A large proportion of systems (especially simple ones) have a fixed
master clock for audio, telling it what rate it's running at is
orthogonal to starting and stopping it (assuming that control even
exists).

It is vanishingly rare (though possible and possibly even sensible in
extremely unusual situations) for the system to want to reconfigure the
DAI format dynamically at runtime.  No point in doing the same thing
over and over again...

The particular decisions about what to do are a system integration
decision, the system integration is a card decision since devices are in
general flexible enough to support many system designs.
