Some platforms need it because they either don't have bootloader
support, they couldn't change the boot interface, or they don't have a
bootwrapper they can put it in. I'd rather have it in common code than a
different implementation on each architecture.

For the copy flag, it would be fine to put an "if (IS_CONFIGURED())"
test around the copy block so that it never happens on some
architectures.
