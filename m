Do we need to keep adding these into the driver for every SoC
that we support? My understanding is apq8064 can be the one that
requires one clk, and msm8974 can be the one that requires three.
The driver can just have those two compatibles for now, and we
can keep adding compatibles here for the different SoCs, but
really we don't care, that's just to save ourselves if something
pops up and needs a workaround.

It will certainly look weird if it's firmware that's compatible
with qcom,scm-msm8974 but on an apq8084, so perhaps something
more generic like, qcom-scm-v1 and qcom,scm-v2 can be used as the
generic compatible in the driver:

	compatible = "qcom,scm-apq8064", "qcom,scm-v1";

	vs.

	compatible = "qcom,scm-apq8084", "qcom,scm-v2";

?

I just want to avoid the constant SoC churn update here if we can.
