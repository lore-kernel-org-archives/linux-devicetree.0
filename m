It seems extremely odd to me that the data delay would just happen to
end up meaning that inverting the clock works out to magically make
everything work.

Still, if there really is a use-case for this in otherwise simple audio
systems, then I guess specifying all the DAI properties in sub-nodes is
indeed to simplest/most-flexible way to go.
