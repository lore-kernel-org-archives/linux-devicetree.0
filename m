This patch-series adds support for Device tree to 88PM800 mfd driver.
It also sets default configuration of irq clear method if board file
doesn't exist.

Testing::
 - Boot tested on PXA1928 based platform.
 - probe of mfd, rtc and regulator function passing successfully.
 - Basic read operations on registers
 - irq clear configuration

  - Renamed binding back again to 88pm800, as 'Yi Zhang' already started
    submitting 88pm88x, so 88pm8xx won't make sense. Better name would be to
    stick with 88pm80x.
  - Added new patch to series PATCH 2/4, to remove unwanted protection around
    padata
  - As suggested by Lee, added macro based implementation for CLEAR_ON_WRITE
    and CLEAR_ON_READ.
  - and fixed other trivial comments.

   -  irq clear method is 88PM800 feature, which is not dependent on board or
      doesn't require any wiring changes, so DT is not the way.
      Hardcoded to "irq clear on write" if board file doesn't exist.
   - Updated binding patch (PATCH 3/3) to remove irq-clr-on-wr entry.
   - Since PATCH 3/3 changed from original, removed Rob's Acked-by.

V2 => V3
=======
Link to V2: https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg914299.html

   - Replaced deprecated "regulator-compatible" property with "regulator-name".
   - Added Rob's Acked-by  to [PATCH 3/3]

V1 => V2
=======
Link to V1: http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1505.3/04386.html

  - Split binding changes from original commit
  - Updated binding info as per Rob's suggestion
  - Dropped PATCH 4/4, as discussed during review
  - Dropped PATCH 3/4, as it is independent RTC code change,
    so will submit it separately to ease merging.
  - Fixed all other minor comments

Attempt has been made to push some of the patches to the list sometime
back in 2013.
