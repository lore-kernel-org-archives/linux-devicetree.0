Rob,

I'm attempting to convert mach-kirkwood boards over to devicetree,
starting with the dreamplug.

You can find my stable patches here:

git://git.infradead.org/users/jcooper/linux-kirkwood.git kirkwood_dt_stable

and the stuff I'm still trying to figure out:

git://git.infradead.org/users/jcooper/linux-kirkwood.git kirkwood_dt_staging

My next task looks like converting the irq code, since mv_cesa fails
silently without the interrupt-controller specified in the dtb.

The code I'm replacing can be found here:

arch/arm/mach-kirkwood/irq.c
arch/arm/plat-orion/irq.c

This is the first time I've attempted something like this, so any
pointers would be much appreciated.  Also, if there is anything I would
need to deconflict with, please let me know.

thx,

Jason.
