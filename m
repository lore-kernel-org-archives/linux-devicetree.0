Hi!

This is perhaps not a true resend in that these three patches were
originally in a larger series [1], and the series have been rebased
to v4.18-rc6. However, I did ask that these three patches should be
considered separately. The other patches in the original series have
been adopted and reworked by Russell King [2].

The background for these patches is that our PCB interface between
the SAMA5D3 and the ds90c185 lvds encoder is only using 16 bits, and
this has to be described somewhere, or the atmel-hlcdc driver have no
chance of selecting the correct output mode. Since we have similar
problems with a tda19988 HDMI encoder I added patches to override
the atmel-hlcdc output format via DT properties compatible with the
media video-interface binding and things start to play together.
I of course need my old patches or the new ones from Russell to
actually use the HDMI encoder with the SAMA5D3, but that is not
directly related to this (shortened) series.

Cheers,
Peter
