Hold on! All patches that changes the DT parsing to accept the
"standardized wakeup-source" binding, need to be merged upstream
before corresponding DTS changes.

Therefore, I suggest we go for a two step approach, starting with
changes affecting the DT parsing/documentation for various
drivers/subsystem and perhaps we can reach 4.4 for these.
Then the DTS changes can go in at any later point.

Kind regards
Uffe
