Something are messed at here. We have these buffer are used in mailbox.
They should be allocated as non-cacheable.

If these buffers are contained in memory memblock in kernel, it means
that they exist in kernel page table with cachable property. When it's
used in mailbox driver with non-cachable property, it'll only cause
cache maintenance issue. So Leo declared these buffers as reserved
in DT with "no-map" property. It's the key. It could avoid the cache
maintenance issue.

GRUB is just a part of bootloader. When linux kernel is running,
who cares GRUB? GRUB's lifetime is already finished.

By the way, UEFI code region is at [0x3Dxx_xxxx, 0x3DFF_FFFF]. Those
mailbox buffer is in [0x05e0_xxxx, 0x06f0_xxxx]. Then I can make sure
UEFI won't touch the reserved buffer. Even if UEFI touched the reserved
buffer, is it an issue? Definitely it's not. UEFI's lifetime is end
when linux kernel is running at hikey. Even if UEFI runtime service
is enabled, the runtime data area is at [0x38xx_xxxx, 0x38xx_xxxx].

As I said above, UEFI won't touch it. And even UEFI touch it, kernel
doesn't care since UEFI's lifetime is end.

I don't need to hack GRUB at all.
