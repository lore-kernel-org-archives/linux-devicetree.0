We should really make these visible options that can be selected
by anyone. Having selects in the ARCH config area is simple, but
also has some downsides:

 1) select is a reverse dependency and is hard for people to
 understand and can sometimes be a pain to track down

 2) build coverage goes down because configs are hidden

 3) we get code bloat like is being discussed here

So I'd really like to see someone take a good look at this whole
Makefile situation that's going on and clean it up so that
they're user visible options and then throw the config options
into the defconfig. It isn't going to block this series, but it
would be nice to do at some later point.
