Thankyou all for providing inputs and comments on previous versions of this
patchset. Here is the v2 of the patchset addressing all the issues raised as
part of previous versions review.

This patchset adds a new simple EEPROM framework to kernel.

Up until now, EEPROM drivers were stored in drivers/misc, where they all had to
duplicate pretty much the same code to register a sysfs file, allow in-kernel
users to access the content of the devices they were driving, etc.
    
This was also a problem as far as other in-kernel users were involved, since
the solutions used were pretty much different from on driver to another, there
was a rather big abstraction leak.
    
This introduction of this framework aims at solving this. It also introduces DT
representation for consumer devices to go get the data they require (MAC
Addresses, SoC/Revision ID, part numbers, and so on) from the EEPROMs.
    
Having regmap interface to this framework would give much better
abstraction for eeproms on different buses.

patch 1-3 Introduces the EEPROM framework.
Patch 4 migrates an existing driver to eeprom framework.
Patch 5-6 Adds Qualcomm specific qfprom driver.
Patch 7 adds entry in MAINTAINERS.

Its also possible to migrate other eeprom drivers to this framework.
Patch 6 can also be made a generic mmio-eeprom driver.

Providers APIs:
	eeprom_register/unregister();

Consumers APIs:
	eeprom_cell_get()/of_eeprom_cell_get()/of_eeprom_cell_get_byname();
	eeprom_cell_read()/eeprom_cell_write();

Device Tree:

	/* Provider */
	qfprom: qfprom@00700000 {
		compatible 	= "qcom,qfprom";
		reg		= <0x00700000 0x1000>;
		...

		/* Data cells */
		tsens_calibration: calib@404 {
			reg = <0x404 0x10>;
		};

		serial_number: sn {
			reg = <0x104 0x4>, <0x204 0x4>, <0x30c 0x4>;

		};
		...
	};
	
	/* Consumer node */
	tsens: tsens {
		...
		eeproms = <&tsens_calibration>;
		eeprom-names = "calib";
		...
	};

userspace interface:

hexdump /sys/class/eeprom/qfprom0/eeprom

Changes since v1(https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/3/5/153)
 * Fix various Licencing issues spotted by Paul Bolle and Mark Brown
 * Allow eeprom core to build as module spotted by Paul Bolle.
 * Fix various kconfig issues spotted by Paul Bolle.
 * remove unessary atomic varible spotted by Mark Brown.
 * Few cleanups and common up some of the code in core.
 * Add qfprom bindings.

Changes since RFC(https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/2/19/307)
 * Fix documentation and error checks in read/write spotted by Andrew Lunn
 * Kconfig fix suggested by Stephen Boyd.
 * Add module owner suggested by Stephen Boyd and others.
 * Fix unsafe handling of eeprom in unregister spotted by Russell and Mark Brown.
 * seperate bindings patch as suggested by Rob.
 * Add MAINTAINERS as suggested by Rob.
 * Added support to allow reading eeprom for things like serial number which
  can be scatters across.
 * Added eeprom data using reg property suggested by Sascha and Stephen.
 * Added non-DT support.
 * Move kerneldoc to the src files spotted by Mark Brown.
 * Remove local list and do eeprom lookup by using class_find_device()


Thanks,
