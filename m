Well, you would get the failure at development time and hopefully fix t=
he DT to
eliminate sparseness of domain numbers.

The problem appears for DTs that don't have the pci-domain info. Then t=
he cached
value is left at the default non-valid value and attempts to rescan the=
 DT will
be made every time the function is called.

ACPI calls them segments and the way Bjorn explained it to me at some m=
oment was
that it was an attempt to split up a bus in different groups (or altern=
atively,
merge a few busses together). To be honest I haven't seen systems where=
 the domain
is anything other than zero, but JasonG (or maybe Benjamin) were floati=
ng an
idea of using the domain number to identify physical slots.

It is meant to do allocation with the retrieval being a short-cut (or f=
ine
control if you want).

I need to think a bit more for a better solution.
