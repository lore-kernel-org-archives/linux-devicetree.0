Hi Andy,

This patchset adds support to DB600c which is based on APQ8064.

With this patchset, except spi I was able to test all the below features
on this board on top of v4.6-rc3.
1> i2c
2> spi
3> sd/mmc with card detect
4> eMMC
5> USB
6> SATA
7> on board Ethernet based on PCIE.
8> user and activity leds.
9> on board Magnetometer

This patchset also has a fix to i2c/spi pinctrls which was not set correctly
in my previous apq8064 patches, I have verified this patchset with eeprom and
sensors on the board, you might want to take that patch in next rc.

Changes since v1:
	- renamed the dts and compatible strings according to the discussion.
	- fixed/renamed led labels as suggeste by Rob, Nico and others.
	- Added Acks for Bjorn
	- Added Magnetometer support.
	- Split the pinconfs to seperate file as suggested by Bjorn
	- Remove activity leds default triggers, as it was not clear
	 which trigger was correct according to 96boards specs.
	 Can be added once we fix that.

Thanks,
srini
