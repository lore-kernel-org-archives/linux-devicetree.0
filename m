Even if vendor specific, the properties for not HCI transport case are
still incomplete IMO.

By modes, you mean PCM vs. I2S and all the flavors of timings you can
have within those or something else? For the former, that's often
going to be a process of solving what each end support and if that
doesn't work, then IIRC we already have properties for setting
modes/timing. All the same issues exist with audio codecs and this is
really not any different.
