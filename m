Hmm, should I extend media/video-interfaces.txt with more bus types (or since
I'm targeting parallel interfaces, perhaps the new bus types should be
autodetected from other props?) or should a write a new binding similar to
it?

One question regarding bus-width, should it include hsync/vsync/de/clk?
If yes, how to distinguish rgb565 with all those four from rgb666 with
only de/clk (some panels do not need hsync/vsync)? 20 lines in both
cases...

Or are rgb444/rgb565/rgb666/rgb888 already supported by the media video
interface binding? That's not at all obvious to me.

Cheers,
Peter
