That's the only public doc. But if you need, welcome to discuss with
me off-line about referencing kernels for hikey.

For hikey PMU, please have a look of this patchset:
 - https://github.com/96boards/linux/pull/86/commits
Discussion is here:
 - https://discuss.96boards.org/t/performance-monitoring-unit-pmu/293/4

Due to its implementation is not compatible with upstream, this
patchset was not upstreamed. If you are interested, welcome to adding
them LKML.

Appreciate your effort.
