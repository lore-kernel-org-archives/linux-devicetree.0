Hi Pavel,

Thanks for the feedback.

Yes I agree.

One possibility is that I could add a suspend function to EDAC that
always fails with a helpful message like "Suspend with EDAC not
supported."  If someone wants to suspend, they'll have to take the
EDAC out of the device tree so its probe will bomb out.  I'm not
sure how normal it is to have suspend functions in the kernel
that always fail, though.

Whatever bootloader is configuring the sdram controller for the
board.

The bootloader is responsible for configuring the sdram
controller with parameters appropriate for whatever vendor's DDR
is on the board, so that's where this must go.

Now I realize I should make this message more general, since it is
true for the socfpga cyclone5 devkit, but may need to be adjusted
for other boards.
