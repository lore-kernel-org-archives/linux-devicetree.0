Seems like there are some benefits to integrating with the clocking framework.
I will have to consider what kernel APIs we want to expose as well.  I believe
we may have another kernel driver wanting to control this tweaking.  Do you feel
it is ok to have to PLL code reside in this driver for now, and then we can patch
later after we get this clocking control sorted out.
