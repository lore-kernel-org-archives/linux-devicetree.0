Yes. That was what I mentioned in the second half of my reply.

OK. I'm guessing there's the possibility that some pins or GPIOs get muxed
to different functions depending on what base board is used? How would
you list them, if you only had one .dts file, say for the EVB? Clearly
the SoM cannot work by itself, so it probably doesn't get its own .dts
file.

Cool.
