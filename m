Sure this can get removed.

As said - it is just pushing the patches upstream,
so I did not even touch it.

Actually it is just: <sample-width> * <number of channels>
where number of channels is fixed to 2 for bcm2835-i2s.

So maybe that already happens automatically in the framework?

I will need to test it...

I also know that some of the audio guys working on the rpi
would like to be able to configure BCLK ratios based on both:
sample frequency and sample_width.

Basically they want to control the clock divider/clock parent
trying to avoid fractional dividers.

Something like this could get added to the core?
Is there interest in getting something like this?

Could look like this:
bclk-ratios = 
  /* for 96kHz at 16bit/channel use bclk-ratio 40 */
  <96000 16 40>, 
  /* for 48kHz at 32bit/channel use bclk-ratio 80 */
  <48000 16 80>,
  /* for any (other) sample frequency at 16 bit use bclk-ratio 32 */
  <0 16 32>,
  /* for any (other) sample frequency at 32 bit use bclk-ratio 64 */
  <0 32 64>;

but there could also be other approaches as well,
how this could get described in the device tree.
