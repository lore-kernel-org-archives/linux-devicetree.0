Thanks you for the review. I'll revise the patch and send a [V3]

But please see my reply at some points.

[Nic]: i.MX6 SabreSD board uses these two extra pins for jack detection.
You're exactly right that CODEC already has this function. But the hardware
guy of Freescale, who put the extra pins here, has his own reason that
Android needs not codec driver but machine driver to handle the detection and
use an event to report pin status to Android system. Well this event code
hasn't been included in this patch though. So since hardware has pins here,
I think it's better to put in the binding doc as well. But I guess it'd be
better to put it into OPTIONAL area?

[Nic:] fsl_ssi.c uses symmmetric_rates, but last time I traced soc-pcm.c
and found the core only cares about symmmetric_rates during pcm_open(),
which means the startup() in dai/machine driver, while what I'm considering
is something like "arecord -Dhw:0 -r 44100 | aplay -Dhw:0 -r 48000":
The two startup() would run almost at the same time and each of them would
be earlier than hw_param() -- the exact point we can get the sample rate
from application, but before this point no sample-rate actually be set to
make hw_constraint(). Then the two hw_param() would continue their code and
successively call set_fll() twice with different sample rates.
But I agree that it's kinda ugly to put code here. So I think maybe I need
to drop this part of code and to think about another patch for the core?

[Nic] I've seen and tested set_bias_level() way as samsung/tobermory.c does.
But I find a flaw to the method that if I play two and more wav files like
'aplay -Dhw:0 audio44Khz.wav audio48Khz.wav audio22Khz.wav', which needs to
set_fll() before each playback and to keep SYSCLK valid by changing its source
to MCLK after the playback, but I only found that hw_param() and hw_free()
are symmetrically called before/after each playback in this case.
