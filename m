Which subsystem are you familiar with? Every stack is designed like
that -- controller drivers reflect the physical hardware, any
emulation/protocol is implemented in the user layer.

You may never use, but if the driver reflects the controller as
precisely as it is, linux could support any usecase that some
baremetal code could support on your platform.
For example, you could support "normal" and "scu" mode over the 3-cell
mechanism I suggested. But your original proposal/assumption of
"scu-mode", failed immediately, hence Oleksij had to imlpement the
"normal" mode.

The RX and TX are not independent of each other, their priorities are
tied together in hardware. So it makes more sense (as compared to
declaring them independent) to club them together as one channel.
Whatever example you take - MHU or TI - you won't find a driver that
implements a virtual mode like "scu-mode".

Passing data directly via controller makes sense only when your
protocol defines fixed length packets that fit into registers (usually
FIFOs) or there is no shared memory between the processors.
Otherwise, you write a data packet at some located in shmem, and
provide its start and size along with the code of expected operation
on it, over the mailbox. Please refer to "Passing frame information"
para of page-2743 of your manual.
That is another reason the SCU implementation is broken - it has
variable length packets and yet use registers to pass them around.

OK. But what is SCU exactly? Part of ATF? Do you get some binary from
third party? If the last, you shouldn't be paying hsit for such a
design.

What you call "suggested to use in hardware reference manual" is just
1/5 examples of usecase.
And SCU is not even doing that correctly (it uses variable length
packet, unlike the fixed 4-words suggestion).

A manual can suggest multiple ways of implementing a usecase. It is
our job to chose the best one.
