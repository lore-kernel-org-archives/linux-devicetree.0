Mike,

I agree with you and Arnd about clumsiness and a generic approach, but
this driver is a little different from controlling _all_ clocks within
the tree. It just adds one consumer that can _request_ a new rate.

Nevertheless, I can have a look at clk-debug and adding the functionality.

This will happen for sure.

On a generic approach I would rather have a look at the actual ops that
are provided and name the files accordingly. That will also allow us
_not_ to set the rate of crystal oscillators ;)

Sure, but it will not help much against userspace hardware clock
utilities ;)
