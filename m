That and button detection.

That seems like a particularly unfortunate choice given that
VOICECOMMAND is used in the standard Google headset mapping (see
ts3a227e for an example, that's a device specifically aimed at providing
accessory detection in Chromebooks).  There's also been some pushback
against using the input devices due to the difficulty in enabling apps
to access input devices - ALSA controls were preferred instead but
that's less helpful for tinyalsa.  Perhaps that can be added relatively
easily, or a uevent or something.

Not sure what the best way forward here is, the other implementations of
this that I'm aware of do more of the detection in offload and present
streams of detected audio to userspace via normal capture.

I would at least suggest moving this into a separate patch and doing
the integration separately.
