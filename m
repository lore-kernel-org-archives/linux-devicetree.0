It's a hack because keeping the backlight power on when the display is off 
will consume power unnecessarily. The backlight power should be turned off in 
that case.

This has been attempted 6 years ago, and got rejected. See https://lwn.net/
Articles/525422/.

The problem is that the number of power supplies, the order in which they need 
to be sequenced, and the related timings (as in delays required between 
turning power supplies on/off) is highly hardware-specific. We can't hardcode 
a specific sequence and specific timings in the gpio-backlight (or pwm-
backlight) driver, and specifying the sequence in DT was considered to be 
over-engineered.

You thus have two options, either creating a custom backlight driver that will 
handle the power supplies specific to your backlight controller, or 
integrating backlight power supply control in your panel driver. If the power 
supplies also power the panel and not just the backlight, or if their 
sequencing depends in any way on the panel model in which the backlight 
controller is integrated, I'd go for the latter, otherwise you can pick any of 
the two methods.
