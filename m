Hi,

before I have a closer look I have some general questions, especially
about the heavy usage of SysFS for configuring the IP core module.
Generally, we are not allowed to use SysFS for CAN device configuration.

- Why may the user want to configure the resources on a per device base?

- Aren't there good default values which work just fine for 99% of the
  users?

- Why could the resources not be configured via device tree (or platform
  code)?

- Are there other IP cores already supported by mainline Linux, e.g.
  uart. How are they configured?

Hardware filters should definitely not be defined via SysFS. We do not
have an interface yet, mainly because it does not fit into a multi user
concept. Anyway, we need such an interface *sooner* than later. Needs
some further thoughts.

A name should be "vendor,device", e.g. gaisler,grcan. It's also unusual
to add release numbers. Also, you do not distinguish between the devices
above. Then, just use one name and the others are compatible to that one
(even if they are named differently). Well, I realized that the device
tree police is less strict than it was 1..2 years ago... anyway, please
have a look to the many examples around, also for CAN.

Ditto. "clock-frequency" is a common name for that purpose.

Why can't this be handled via compatible string?

Hm, is this related? There are more below.

I will have a closer look to the driver code later this week.

Thanks,
