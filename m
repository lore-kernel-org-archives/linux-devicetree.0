I was thinking about this more, and had, I hope, a better idea:  change
the 'depends on ARCH_KIRKWOOD_DT' to 'selects ARCH_KIRKWOOD_DT' and
remove the first entry.  This way, the logic remains the same and the
word 'Dreamplug' is always visible.  Any objections?

Agreed.

Good catch, will fix in v5.

hmm, Globalscale Tech is, as I understand it, a turn-key manufacturer.
They are simply building Marvell's development platforms for them,
handling sales, etc.  My impression was that Marvell designed the board
and contracted Globalscale to build and distribute it.

I don't care which we use, but is the convention to use the SoC designer
(marvell,dreamplug), the SoC (kirkwood,dreamplug), or the brand
(globalscale,dreamplug)?

If there is no set standard, I think the SoC is most accurate, as
nothing prevents a manufacturer from swapping out ICs/SoCs between
manufacturing runs of the same make/model.  Look at certain wifi USB
devices for examples.

thx,

Jason.
