Subject: [PATCH v3 0/5] Mailbox: Provide support STi based platforms
Date: Wed, 19 Aug 2015 15:22:50 +0100

ST's platforms currently support a maximum of 5 Mailboxes, one for
each of the supported co-processors situated on the platform.  Each
Mailbox is divided up into 4 instances which consist of 32 channels.
Messages are passed between the application and co-processors using
shared memory areas.

Also included in the set is an example Client which should be generic
enough to use as a testing environment for all Mailbox IPs which use
shared memory or the API to pass messages.  With small changes, it
should also be able to test more extravagant implementations.

v2 => v3:
 - Controller
   - Shared (DT <=> Device Driver) defines removed
   - Return actual error codes instead of NULL in xlate()
   - Not passing 'direction' configuration via DT anymore
     - Removed all accompanying configuration checking code
 - Test F/W
   - Allow Rx-only and Tx-only controllers to be tested
   - Cater for controllers requiring pre-Tx 'signal' to be sent
   - Supply 'wr-' message debugfs file
     - When written to, will Tx message through Mailbox Framework
     - When read from, will print out a hexdump of Rx'ed message
 
v1 => v2:
 - New MACRO() to obtain base address for a given instance
 - Move locking into the structure it protects
 - Stop checking for 'ready' state when sending data
 - Don't clear channel data (that belongs to the API)
 - #define register offsets instead of providing via pdata
 - Register driver with module_platform_driver()
