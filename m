The purpose of this patch series is to add DT support and modernize
the ohci-da8xx glue driver without breaking the non-DT boot,
which is still used in unconverted davinci devices.

The first couple of patches, are the recent and ongoing efforts from
David Lechner to clean up davinci-mach code and the ochi-da8xx driver,
Im including these patches on this series for completeness sake.

Then I re-based an old patch by Manjunath Goudar[4] to be able to build
the driver as a module. We can now add this patch because we removed
references to sysconf registers by using David's patches.

Then I prepare the stage for a DT boot which does not depend on any
mach-arch/* callbacks by using a regulator to handle the vbus and
over current gpios. For this, i extended the fixed regulator driver to
register for an irq and send a regulator notification if an over curent
pin is specified.

The only dependency left for this series is the recently re-posted patch
by David to remove references to mach-code[1], which is approved and
should be picked up soon.

Note 1: Testing was done on a omap138-lcdk board, using DT, and non-DT boot,
and checking that in both cases the hub, usb mass storage and an input
device are correctly enumerated and working. The omap138-lcdk does not
have gpios to control vbus and get over current interrupt notifications.
If anyone has a da830-evm based board and could confirm that ohci is
correctly working, i would appreciate it.
(the OHCI option needs to be enabled in menuconfig)

Note 2: It seems that the davinci-gpio driver is broken for DT based boot
and any gpio > 32. (luckly none of the DT based boards use gpios yet)
The issue is discussed here [2]

Note 3: A git branch based on tag: next-20161021 with the dependencies
is available in my github here [3].

Changes from v1->v2
* Rebased and added patch to make ohci a separate driver
* Use a regulator instead of handling Gpios (David Lechner)
* Add an overcurrent mode to regulator framework
* Fixed regulator is able to register for and overcurrent irq
* Added patch by Alexandre to remove build warnings
* Moved global variables into private hcd structure.
