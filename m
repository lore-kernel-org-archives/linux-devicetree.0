This appears to be a statement about the driver implementation, but bindings
documents are about describing hardware. Reading the datasheet it actually
appears the ASPEED SGPIO hardware comes up in what is "technically" a
forbidden state (equivalent to `nr-gpios = <0>;`), though the device is also
disabled at this point, so it's probably moot. The point is the true default
value from a hardware perspective is 0, not 80, so if we're going to talk about
default values, 0 would be more appropriate. However:

You've also listed nr-gpios under the "Required properties" header, but the
description suggests it's optional. It's either one or the other, please lets be
clear about it. On that front, lets make it nr-gpios *not* optional (i.e. make it
required) thus force the specification of how many SGPIOs we want to emit
on the bus. This value is coupled to the platform design, so I don't think
there's ever a scenario where we want nr-gpios to take a default value.

Again here with the default value - SGPM CLK period is derived from PCLK by
the expression `period = PCLK * 2 *(GPIO254[31:16] + 1)`, where GPIO254's
initialisation state is `GPIO254[31:16] = 0`, which gives a default SGPM bus
frequency of PCLK / 2. This is likely not going to be 1MHz (more like ~12MHz).

Lets just make the property required. That way we avoid any ambiguity about
the bus frequency and thus don't need words about defaults that turn out to
be about the driver, not about the hardware.

Finally, when updating patches in response to feedback, please send the full
series again, and bump the series version number. That way people can review
a coherent set of patches and not have to hunt around and (fail to) collate the
correct combination. It makes it easier to say "Reviewed-by:" on your patches :)

Cheers,

Andrew
