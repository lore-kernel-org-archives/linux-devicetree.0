I don't think it is the goal. It should allow to deal with board
revisions, for example some components put on an other i2c bus to
isolate an i2c device corrupting the bus in some cases. It should
concern plugable h/w which is only needed at boot time for instance a
display panel if we want to show a splash screen.
