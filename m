Sibi might be working on doing that for the SDM845 CPUfreq driver.
Georgi could also change his GPU driver use case to use this BW OPP
table and required-opps.

The problem is that people don't want to start using this until we
decide on the DT representation. So it's like a chicken and egg
situation.
