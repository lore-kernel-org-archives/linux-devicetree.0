The UEFI firmware for the FVP models does implement automatic
selection between a variety of builtin DTBs. I.e., FVP base or
foundation model, with either GICv2 for GICv3. I think the maintainer
of the binary releases chose not to enable this in the builds he
distributes, but it is certainly unnecessary to fiddle with DT images
if you build the firmware yourself (but you need to set DTB_DIR when
building)
