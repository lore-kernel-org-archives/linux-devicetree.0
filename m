Sorry for my bad understanding.

Still not clear about the otg_set_peripheral, which is required in 
phy-hi6220-usb.c

1. drivers/usb/dwc2/gadget.c use
otg_set_peripheral(hsotg->uphy->otg, &hsotg->gadget);

2. include/linux/phy/phy.h
struct phy do not have member otg, while struct usb_phy has.

Could you give more hints?

Thanks
