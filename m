I am not sure I can follow. orion_bridge_irq_init() maps the first
parent irq, i.e. hwirq 0 of orion_irq. The parent irq controller
clears that irq cause when all corresponding chained irqs are
cleared. The chained (bridge) irqs are cleared by
orion_bridge_irq_handler above.

I can put a note to the parent irqchip in orion_irq_init() that we
don't need to clear its cause register, if it is that what you mean?
