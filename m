Hi Niklas,

Great to see this has finally worked.

As Jean-Christophe already commented, we should drastically limit
the amount of code duplication between this platform and the one
that is already there. I can see two ways out of here:

a) Make sure that all hardware that was working with the
existing code still works with this one, and just replace it
(or patch it to look like what you have), mandating the use
of device tree blobs on u8500 right away. We should get there
anyway over time, so we could just as well do it now.

b) keep using your patch as a work-in-progress copy of the
existing code, but when we get to merge it into upstream make sure
that any part of it that is just duplicated either gets replaced
with a device node and associated properties, or calls the respective
function from a common location.

In any case, I would suggest you remove the platform_device definitions
for all devices and just leave the platform_data that you can pass
using the auxdata mechanism.

This change conflicts with some other patches that we have been discussing
recently. I'd suggest rebasing your change on top of the others as soon
as they are merged into arm-soc/next/fixes-non-critical.

I would prefer if we could move those devices that have binding already
into the device tree right away and leave only the ones that are missing
in the initial merge of this.

gpio-leds has bindings according to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/led.txt

Converting those should be straightforward as soon as the gpio node
is converted. The same is true for gpio-keys.

This one does not have bindings yet, so let's leave it for now.

Converting ab8500 to device tree is key here, because almost everything
else is located below it. I'd suggest you use auxdata to replace the
get the platform_data in unmodified as a start and then change the
ab8500 mfd driver to scan its child buses.

It looks like the uart device could just as well work without DMA support,
right? How about leaving the dma out for now, until we have bindings for
it? That will also remove the need for platform_data in most of the uart
devices.

Here, you should really have only one DT_MACHINE_START for all three, and
use a common init_machine function but a dt_compat list for all three.

Inside of the init_machine function, you can use of_machine_is_compatible()
to find out which one you are on, and call the machine specific functions.
