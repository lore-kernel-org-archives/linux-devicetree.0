Did Andy's idea of using the above tag work for you?  It appears that
there are a few patches you don't need there, but it shouldn't hurt to
pick them up too I think?  Here's what I see:

It seems like it's too late to land RPMh-regulator for 4.19, so I
guess we'll have to aim for 4.20.  I'm not sure if that means you're
going to want to wait until 4.20-rc1 comes out to use as a base before
thinking about landing RPMh-regulator?  If so then I guess we've got
~3 weeks before something could land and we could start landing device
tree bits using RPMh-regulator.  If that's the plan then we'll
probably just start landing things in the Chrome OS tree now and suck
up the extra work of trying to resolve differences later...

Thanks!
