2 drivers for the same compatible would be a bit of a problem without
any other information to tell one of the drivers not to probe.

What I had in mind was adding a pwm-audio node (describing what's
connected to the PWM output) similar to what we have for
pwm-backlight. We already have pwm-beeper as well. In theory, then a
pwm-audio driver could work with any PWM. In reality, the overhead
would be too high for dumb PWMs. You would need some batching support
in the PWM subsystem in order to use DMA effectively, and I don't know
if the PWM subsystem supports that currently.
