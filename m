Do you really expect the open-source community to make a serious effort 
to support out-of-tree drivers written by developers who have no 
intention of upstreaming?

There's a process for writing a Linux kernel driver with a DT binding. 
That process is not broken.

Mark is correct.  Trying to create a device tree binding, and getting it 
correct 100% the first time, without an actual drivers is just 
impossible.  To even attempt that is folly.

Yes, it is.

I'm not sure I agree with that.

No it isn't.  SOC manufacturers should just release the documentation 
they have.

Similar to what?  Every upstream driver today is written the way we're 
talking about -- submit the driver with the binding, and both are 
reviewed together.

Hopefully, you'll be the last.
