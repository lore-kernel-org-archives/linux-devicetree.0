Not even that. This is a host/user relationship, as VFIO is in no way
virtualisation specific. It just gives you a way to make a device
accessible to userspace. KVM is just a specialised instance of a more
generic problem.

I have no problem with the split design (whatever floats your boat),
more with the terminology which I find very confusing. It would be a lot
better if you stuck with management (host) and client (user), or some
other general terminology.
