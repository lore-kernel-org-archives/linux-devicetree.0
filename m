Thankyou for reviewing v4 patchset, here is v5 addressing comments from v4.
Major change is moving the driver out of MFD as there are no immediate plans
to add support to other drivers on this codec.

Qualcomm WCD9335 Codec is a standalone Hi-Fi audio codec IC.
It is integrated in multiple Qualcomm SoCs like: MSM8996, MSM8976,
and MSM8956 chipsets.

WCD9335 had multiple functional blocks, like: Soundwire controller,
interrupt mux, pin controller, Audio codec, MBHC, MAD(Mic activity Detection),
Ultrasonic proximity and pen detection, Battery-voltage monitoring and
Codec processing engine.

Currently this patchset has been only tested with SLIMbus interface due
to hardware avaiablity, but it can be easily made to work with both SLIMbus
and I2C/I2S.    

This patchset adds very basic playback and capture support without much
fancy features. New features will be added once the basic support is in.
This patchset is tested on top of linux-next on DB820c for both playback
, capture paths and MBHC.

Some parts of the code has been inherited from Qualcomm andriod kernel,
so credits to various authors.

WCD9335 can be interfaced via I2S/I2C or SLIMbus. 

Here is our integration branch incase someone want to try this out:

Thanks,
Srini

Changes since v4 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/17/21/)

 - defer support to MBHC for more testing!
