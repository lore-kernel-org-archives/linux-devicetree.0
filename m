No, the firmware-name (and matching resolution as different firmwares
report different axis-ranges for the same digitizer) is selected
primarily by the touchscreen_variant which sets: touchscreen_fw_name,
touchscreen_width and touchscreen_height.

The touchscreen_variant module option defaults to -1 which means "auto",
when it is auto it gets set based on the touchscreen / accelerometer
combination (which more or less uniquely identifies boards sofar),
likewise all the other touchscreen module options default to -1,
but can be overridden from the commandline.

The intention is for things to just work, the commandline options are
there as a fallback.

We could just have:

	i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match-0 = <&touchscreen1>, <&touchscreen2>, <&touchscreen3>;
	i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match-1 = <&accelerometer1>, <&accelerometer2>;

And have the i2c bus code look for an i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match-[i++] property
until it is not found. Having a child-node with its own compatible for this
feels wrong, as it uses a hierarchy where there really is none.

Well x86 does not have DTS.

Let me quote some of the auto-code currently in q8-hardwaremgr.c :

                 /*
                  * These accelerometer based heuristics select the best
                  * default based on known q8 tablets.
                  */
                 switch (data->accelerometer.model) {
                 case da280:
                         if (data->accelerometer.addr == 0x27)
                                 ; /* No-op */
                         else if (data->has_rda599x)
                                 data->touchscreen_invert_x = 1;
                         else
                                 data->touchscreen_invert_y = 1;
                         break;
                 case dmard09:
                         data->touchscreen_invert_x = 1;
                         break;
                 case mxc6225:
                         data->touchscreen_variant = 1;
                         break;
                 }

(Non set data->touchscreen_foo are left at 0).

So this would require us to be able to filter (to use your example)
on if another i2c device is found and on which address it is found,
that does not even take the rda559x check into account and is
going to cause interesting ordering issues, how do we know when
we can actually do the filtering if some of the variables we are
filtering on are set by other auto-detected paths. Which auto-detect /
i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match list do we execute first ? Worse
actually for accelerometer orientation I will likely need to
set the mount-matrix based on the detected touchscreen ...

The rda559x here is a sdio wifi chip, which is also connected to the
i2c, and currently is detected through i2c to be able to separately
identify 2 q8 boards which share the same touchscreen + accelerometer
combination and who knows what other checks I or other people can
come up with to differentiate board variants which do not have
a simple eeprom to uniquely id them.

So as said before, no this cannot be all done in dt without
adding a turing complete language to dt, and that is just to
select which touchscreen_variant to use.

Then there also the probem of the combinatorial explosion having
not only 2 firmware files but also invert-x and invert-y flags causes:
We have 2 revisions with each 2 different firmware-files (more actually
but I've reduced the set since some firmwares are compatible) with each
both the x- and / or y axis as normal or inverted, for a total of:
2 (revision) * 2 (firmware-files) * 2 (x-inverted or not) * 2 (y...) = 16
touchscreen variants, which means dt nodes for touchscreen1 to touchscreen16
and that is just the silead gsl1680, some of these tablets also have
elan or zeitec touchscreen controllers.

Now imagine what happens if a new board comes out which needs a 3th firmware
file... I hope you can understand this is not a route I want to go.

Another problem is that if a user encounters the need for a new firmware
variant he can now not easily try this (where as before we had
module options to separately override firmware-name, the size, etc.

As written in my previous mail, this is all rather gsl1680 specific,
and esp. being able to override the firmware-name, the size, etc.
through module options is going to be useful (to ask endusers to test
stuff without recompiling) on x86 too. So we will likely want to add
most of the necessary stuff to the silead driver anyways.

If the OEM provides a DTB the OEM can just directly have the right
parameters in there without relying on any auto-detection, this is
already supported and the e.g. gsl1680 driver already happily
works on several tablets where there is not so much hardware
variance.

Even if the OEM needs to deal with e.g. different touchscreens on
different board revisions, hopefully the simple auto-detect code will
be enough, and he does not need e.g. different firmware-name settings
for otherwise the same touchscreen controller. If that is not the
case then he the OEM will have to provide a separate static
(non probing) DTB per variant.

Right and all the info I'm talking about can already be in the DTS and
is already specified this way for various existing boards, this is
obviously how we want things to work, this is the normal case /
the straight code path.

Now lets get back to your mount-matrix example, the problem here is 2 board
variants where the same accelerometer is used, but on a newer revision
of the board it is mounted with a different orientation and otherwise
almost nothing is changed on the board, certainly not something as
useful as an id eeprom.

Lets assume that we can however still somehow differ the 2 revisions,
then try to imagine how many different ways there are to differ
between 2 board revisions if there is no easy way to do so,
some crazy examples:
-The 2nd revision has an external loopback on unused audio out / in
  pins for testing purposes, we could play + record sound and do
  a (rough) waveform match to see if the loopback is present
-On the 2nd revision a pin from a pin compatible part which
  allows putting it in fully compatible mode, or allow new features
  mode, is now hooked up to a gpio instead of hardwired to compatible
  mode, we could change the device to new features mode and try
  to read/modify/write some register bit on the chip which is only
  writable in this mode
-Etc.

Now try to design a way to express this in dt and we're back to
needing a turing complete language (with a library for accessing
various busses) again.

Hans
