Those patches should go through different trees. To avoid causing a (temporary)
regression, the clk patch absolutely needs to be merged before any other patches
is merged.

I can take the clk patch as a fix for v4.15. It's too late for v4.14 but it's
not big deal, I suppose the long term kernel will pick it up later on.

Once the sana clock is indeed *the* sana clock, which of IIO or DT patch is
merged first does not matter, the sana clock is optional.

BTW, the cover letter and the IIO patch are missing the IIO maintainer and
mailing list. According to MAINTAINERS, you are missing:

* Jonathan Cameron <jic23@kernel.org>
* linux-iio@vger.kernel.org

Please resend with the warning note above (so other maintainers are aware of
dependency), the correction applied to patch 1 commit log and the missing
recipients.
