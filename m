Sure.

The idea was that we don't need a "full featured standard", but rather
just a contract between currently running firmware and the OS. Since I
consider the DT as being provided as part of the firmware, I don't see
how this would need to be "standardized" beyond that. This is just a
"single bit signalling channel" to implement a "poor man's mailbox", if
you like.
If firmware implements this, it adds the respective node, if not, there
is nothing in the DT.
Do you see any way this would clash with existing standards or would
need to standardized beyond this document? I would believe the SMCCC
covers the bits that would need to standardized already (as in to make
sure to not call any other service tied to a particular smc call).

Both SCPI and SCMI build upon a shared memory region for transferring
arguments and a mailbox channel to signal that there is "work to do".
So this is not competing with those standards, but rather complementing
them and making them more widely usable (in cases where you don't have
an actual mailbox).
SCMI introduced a notion of multiple transport protocols for signalling,
but so far only specifies a mailbox (and does the respective proposed
binding).

Actually this driver is more of a drop-in replacement for an ARM MHU
mailbox (for instance to implement SCPI), so this driver and binding
actually promotes existing standards.

> What exactly is "the generic ARM SMC mailbox"?

That's a bridge between the requirements of having a mailbox (which the
SCPI *binding* requires, for instance) and some firmware parts being
implemented in an EL3 runtime on the APs (instead of running on some
separate management processors).
I am happy to change the name if that sounds presumptuous, the naming
comes from "generic" as in: does not require specific hardware. The
"ARM" in there is just to give context to "SMC", which, as every TLA, is
probably overloaded and confusing to the casual reader.

Right, badly copied from arm-mhu.txt ;-)

OK, I will look into how far this needs to be specified in this document
here or how much we can delegate to the actual mailbox users.

Calling the smc instruction with that function ID triggers the
associated mailbox (in the somewhat Linux/DT meaning of "mailbox").
Basically very much like the ARM MHU mailbox, for instance.

I believe the term mailbox is a bit fuzzy here. I think the least common
denominator just signals a single bit condition (like a doorbell), which
is the only thing that SCPI (for instance) requires. And the actual
mailbox content is then somewhere else, for instance in shared memory.
Which is beyond the scope of the mailbox itself.

Good point, I can describe this one.

Naturally I would expect fast calls, but I am not sure we need to
restrict it here. The SMCCC function ID encodes the type already. And I
couldn't find anything more detailed in the SMCCC to require me to ban
standard calls, so it would be up to the actual firmware implementation
to decide.

What would be the advantage of doing so? I found it necessary to have
the SMCCC IDs in the DT anyway and also useful to support multiple
channels, so just having a list of SMCCC IDs sounded like a natural choice.
Do you reckon we need a combination of SMCCC ID and mailbox ID (as a
second parameter to the SMCCC call), to support cases where we only have
one SMCCC ID available, but need multiple mailboxes?

Sure.

Right, will fix this.
