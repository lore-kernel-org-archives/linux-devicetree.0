Applied on mvebu/dt

Thanks!

Actually the "library" thing is pretty common in the
arch/arm64/boot/dts. One of the first device tree file introduced in
arm64 came with this error and then most of the people copy and paste
it. We also find it on the arm directory but the ratio is lower:

git grep "This library is free software" arch/arm/boot/dts/ | wc -l
20
git grep "This library is free software" arch/arm64 | wc -l
56

For the "GPLv2" vs "GPLv2+" confusion it is less common but not not only
on the ARM64 Marvell-based platforms some freescale are also
impacted. Actually it was first introduce from freescale where "the GPL
or the X11 license" part became "the GPLv2 or the X11 license".

I am pretty sure that this change were not intend from Marvell. But I
will clarify this with them to be able to fix it.
