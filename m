It's a good question.  Right now the way I'm running this stuff we're
mostly setting all the i2s the clock rates from the codec driver, but
I think this isn't the correct way to go, and the i2s driver needs to
set it's rate based on the hw params, but that isn't happening (yet).

This output clock has a mux and can either be a fixed 12Mhz output or
can be derived from the same fractional divider which drives the i2s
block.   I thought it was simpler to keep them all the same, but need
to put ownership in the i2s in anticipation of the i2s driver setting
it's own clock rate.

If you think this is an implementation detail and this output clock
should just be owned by the codec driver, even though I'm guessing it
will just have to be the same as i2s, then I think we can drop this
and make sure simple card (or whatever other codec driver) claims this
clock.
