So I was expecting to see bus support patches for OF first. I think you
have missed those changes. Please do include those in v2 with bindings
and OF support for bus.

On these I think we should have specified dpn properties as specified in
DisCo, but then looking at spec we do not define that for master, but
bus seems to have it.

Pierre do you why master does not have dpn properties in DisCo?

These are software so do not belong here
