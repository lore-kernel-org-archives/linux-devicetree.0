Let's not copy&paste replies, see my response there.

My point is, this should be thought through _before_ merging the patch,
not after.

It is the bootloader's task to deliver the correct memory _size_, with
kernel .dts having the minimum. If there's 1G and 2G models then the
linux.git .dts will have 1G, so that it can run on both, should the
bootloader fail to update it.
The consequence of your change would be that U-Boot needs to set
different $fdtfile values based on memory size, which is a plain stupid
idea for the reasons I already gave. And it has been fought by DT
maintainers in previous cases, such as FPGA configurations or
daughter-boards. Amlogic's vendor U-Boot does have the "fdt" command
available, for any user to adequately tweak a loaded .dtb for use with
mainline Linux (e.g., add linux,usable-memory there) - it can be
automated via environment variables or for lack of "source" command
maybe via "autoscr".

The reason that there are three vega-s95 .dts files never was the
differing memory reg size (which gets overridden), but rather connector
and Wifi chipset features as well as them simply having different names
and therefore different compatible strings.

Ideally I expect to be able to use one .dts for both R-Box Pro models as
well as for both Khadas Vim models - they are not marketed with
differing names, so the differences should hopefully be minor,
especially when we're using brcm,bcm4329-fmac for any chipset anyway.

First, that should've gone into the commit message please.

But this is what I get for that command line:

flag provided but not defined: -vm
Usage of stress:
  -failure regexp
    	fail only if output matches regexp
  -ignore regexp
    	ignore failure if output matches regexp
  -kill
    	kill timed out processes if true, otherwise just print pid (to
attach with gdb) (default true)
  -p N
    	run N processes in parallel (default 8)
  -timeout duration
    	timeout each process after duration (default 10m0s)

The only "stress" I found is in golang-org-x-tools package.

I have been running "large" KVM guests on a Vega S95 Telos, with vendor
U-Boot as well as mainline U-Boot, and did not run into such a problem.

What I did run into yesterday during a large system update was multiple:

INFO: task grub2-probe:22018 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

I'm assuming that's an unrelated linux-next regression.

I have also been running vendor U-Boot on the R-Box Pro, without problems.

On the Odroid-C2 however the bootloader is provided on SD by the user,
so there is no excuse really for the user to use a broken bootloader.
Even if not using the mainline version for lack of MMC drivers, the
Hardkernel branch can easily be patched if necessary.

Whatever the issue is, this patch is clearly wrong by design. Please
revert it ASAP!

For starters, have you tried simply adding a reserved-memory node for
0..0x01000000? v1 did not have that and instead messed with reg.

Andreas
