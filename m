BCM2837 is somewhat unusual in that we build its DT on both arm32 and
arm64.  Most devices are being run in arm32 mode.

Having the body of the DT for 2837 separate from 2835/6 has been a
source of pain, as we often need to make changes that span both
directories simultaneously (for example, the thermal changes for 4.13,
and pinmuxing changes earlier).  Other changes are made more
complicated than they need to be, such as the SDHOST enabling, because
we end up splitting a single change into a 283[56] half and a 2837
half.

I had asked about what we could do about our DT merging troubles back
in https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/5/16/707 with no response.  I'm hoping
we can take this patch as a resolution to that, and submit (almost
all) future RPi DT changes through the arm32 dt tree.
