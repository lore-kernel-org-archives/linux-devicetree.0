It's ok, you can call our driver fat. It is ;-) More seriously, I tend
to agree w/ what you write above.

The approach Boris proposed above seems to make everyone happy:

 1) Keep the old driver for old marvells SoCs (kirkwood, dove and orion)
 2) Introduce the new driver for those that are not supported by the old
    driver, i.e. armada (370, XP, 375, 38x)

AFAICT, this can easily be done (based on compatible strings) and it
will let everyone the time to audit the new driver. Current users will
not be taken by surprise. At some point, when everyone is confident w/
the new driver, we can then switch to that one for all SoCs so that
old platform get more performance.

Additionnally, for those who want to get the feature of the new driver
for their old SoC right now, we *could* add a simple kernel config option
for the new driver to use it for the old SoC too (that one disabling the
old one).

Jason, what do you think of the approach above? 

Cheers,
