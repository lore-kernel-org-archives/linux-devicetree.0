 Ok, I will do it in the next version.

For interrupt configuration the driver could set default configuration
and don't let the DMA client set it.
The goal here is to offer for each DMA client a way to choose his
level of information when an error occured on DMA bus or when a DMA
transfer is complete.
For channel and request ids, these inputs are really mandatory as DMA
mapping (couple channel/request) is fixed.
So each DMA peripheral has it own channel/request ids.

It is really specific to the DMA client.
Many clients transfer DMA from peripheral at fixed register address so
in this use case PINC=0. (It is the most common case)
But others clients could do it by incrementing an memory area after
each transfer and in this case PINC=1.
I don't have any example in mind for the second use case but as the
DMA supports it I would like to keep it.

You're right it could be a dynamic property of the system but we don't
have any way to set it via the dmaengine API.
So, we decide to set it before requesting a DMA transfer and keep it
during all peripheral life.

The STM32 DMA has a 4 words FIFO to temporarily stores data from source.
The threshold level is used to know at each which FIFO filling rate
the data stores in the FIFO will be really sent to the destination.
For example, with FIFO threshold = 1/2 full FIFO, we wait at least 2
words of data from source before storing it into to the destination.

The Direct mode bit is used to choose if you want to use FIFO or not.
In direct mode (Direct mode = 0), the data coming from source are not
temporarily stored in the DMA FIFO and are directly stored into the
destination.
In FIFO mode ((Direct mode = 1), the data are temporarily stored in
the DMA FIFO and then in the destination according to the FIFO
threshold level as explained above.

Again the driver could set default configuration and don't let the DMA
client set it.
The goal here is to offer for each DMA client a way to choose his
level of information when an error occured on DMA bus.

Thanks for your review and comments.
