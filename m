This change was made inline to the comments provided in previous version 
of the patch https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/3/576

AFAIK, reg field should only contain index and instance, which was also 
discussed  at https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/3/747

Yep, I got similar comments from other reviewers too, so I will fix all

okay, I will fix such instances in the patchset in next version.

I would say partly, I think kstrtoul will only parse string as hex if 
its prefixed with "0x" But the compatible does not have 0x prefix..
we could probably do some prefixing before passing to kstrtoul to remove 
above function.. I will try that and see!

I agree, but as I said, its done as part of the review comments on v5 
patchset.
