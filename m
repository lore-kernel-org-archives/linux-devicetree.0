A slave node has the same meaning as a node referenced by a phandle
in slaves.  The only difference is where in the DT the node appears:
if the slave is shared by two masters then it probably doesn't make
sense to bury the node inside one of the masters' nodes.

I would picture the DT for your example system something like this:

	root: / {
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#address-cells = <2>;
		memory { ... };

		peripherals {
			ranges = ...;

			iommu {
				reg = < ... >;
				interrupts = < ... >;
				slaves = <&root>;
			};

			dc {
				slaves = <&iommu>;
				...
			};

			dmac@1 {
				slaves = <&iommu>;
				...
			};

			dmac@2 {
				slave {
					#address-cells = <2>;
					#size-cells = <2>;
					ranges = < 0 0 0 0 0 1 >;
					slaves = <&root>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

Here, for reasons best known to the hardware designers, dmac@2 is
not connected via the IOMMU, but is only 32-bit capable, hence
we have a ranges property to describe how the root address space
is seen by dmac@2.  (slave/#size-cells is 2 purely because we cannot
describe a size of 2^32 with #address-cells=1).

I could equally have done

	dmac@2 {
		slaves = <&foo>;

		foo {
			#address-cells = <2>;
			#size-cells = <2>;
			ranges = < 0 0 0 0 0 1 >;
			slaves = <&root>;
		};
	};

... hence the doubt about whether "slave" nodes are really useful
in addition to "slaves" properties.

The compatible string on the referenced node tells you what it is.

The driver associated with the "iommu" node would provide functionality
to report the downstream mapping capabilities in this case, though it's
possible we could do parts of it in a generic way.

In case it wasn't clear, this proposoal is only about how to describe
linkage.  For IOMMUs and some other devices we also need to describe
how some other bus signals get mapped etc.

I have some ideas on these other areas, but I didn't want to dump it
all at once.

Initially I would expect that Linux would only support rather limited
variations on this theme.

In particular, we would determine the path from each master device to
/memory, recording the mappings and components that we go through
along the way.

The simplest cases are:

  a) There is nothing on the path except static address remappings.

  b) There is nothing on the path except a single IOMMU.

There is no need why Linux should cope with anything that doesn't
match the simple cases until/unless such a system appears.  When and
if that happens, we would have a ready-made way of describing it.
