Hi Uwe,

Thanks for your support.

I had that feeling too when I pushed the ISL12057 driver.

I'll ask but I am skeptical: I already tested all the MPP of the SoC so
unless I missed something, it's unlikely.

This is the problem: I just need to enable the interrupt in the ISL1205=
7
(flag in regs) but w/o dealing with SoC/system interrupt, i.e. w/o havi=
ng
a client->irq passed to the driver. In current RTC framework, alarm
support requires a client->irq and a working interrupt line w/ the SoC.

yes.=20

In practice, yes. But RTC framework does not support that. Or maybe
there is some trick a maintainer would be aware of to support that
scenario. Something involving:

 - returning some specific value in alarm_irq_enable handler
 - calling device_init_wakeup(dev, true); w/o having an IRQ line
 - extend workaround started in c9f5c7e7a84f and 4a649903f91232
   and expose those via dt
 - ...

Now, we're two to think that way ;-)

Yes, but I wanted to handle the problem at hand before soldering IRQ#1
on my RN102 and add more feature.
