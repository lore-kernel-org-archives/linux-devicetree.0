OK, accepting extra bits is fine.  You should set sig_bits in the DAI so
userspace can see what's going on if it cares.

There are some with over temperature handling (eg, wm8962) but it's
relatively uncommon for observable protection features to be implemented
in silicon and even rarer for the interrupts to be hooked up (and hence
useful to support in software) unless there is also accessory detection
in the device.  On older devices the required digital logic was often
excessively expensive and realistically only relatively high power
speaker drivers have much risk of something going wrong - things like
headphone outputs or smaller speaker drivers end up with protection from
their supplies collapsing well before the device is in physical danger.
