Hi,

Changes since v1:
- Added tested by from Sushaanth Srirangapathi
- Updated to use the non 16bit arrays [1]
- memcpy channels are not reserved as requested by Sekhar - DMA memcpy is
  disabled for now

Switch to use the new eDMA bindings and enable DMA for MMC0, SPI1.
Add node for MMC1.

[1]
As it has been discussed in the following thread:
https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-omap@vger.kernel.org/msg122117.html

the DT bindings has been changes compared to what we had in 4.4-rc1: the arrays
now don't have the 16bit type.
The changes are now merged to mainline and Vinod provided us a branch:

git://git.infradead.org/users/vkoul/slave-dma.git fix/edma

Which is based on 4.4-rc1 and only contains the two patch for changing the eDMA
bindings.

Regards,
Peter
