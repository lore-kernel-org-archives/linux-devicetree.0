'interrupts-extended' was implied before as it is always supported and
outside the scope of the binding. But now it is needed to validate
bindings. There must be some use of it and that's why I added it.
However, thinking some more about this, I think it may be better to
have the tools add this in automatically whenever we have an
interrupts property.

I guess the single interrupt case is less obvious now with no
description (it's the first list item of 'oneOf'). The schema If the
single interrupt is not supported, then we can drop it here.
