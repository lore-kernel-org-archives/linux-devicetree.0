Sir, you've already applied the v6 of this patch last week :)
And I can still find it in topic/fsl-sai.

ca3e35c ASoC: fsl_sai: Add clock controls for SAI

And regarding the old DTs compatibilty, Shawn has already reminded me
in his comments against one of the version. I took his advice and made
the patch compatible with the old 'sai' clock binding within that v6.

Thank you,
Nicolin
