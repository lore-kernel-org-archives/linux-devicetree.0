The way I did it only dividers and gates are child nodes of their
parents. The muxes instead are located at the base of the clock tree and
have a parent property which describes all possible parents. A board
could then add a current-parent = <phandle> property in its board dts
(similar to the status = enabled property). Something like this:

imx53.dtsi:

...
		periph_apm: clkmux-periph_apm@0x53fd4018 {
			reg = <0x53fd4018 0x0>;
			shift = <0x00000000>;
			width = <0x00000002>;
			parent = <&pll1 &pll3 &lp_apm 0>;
			compatible = "fsl,imx51-clk-mux";
		};
...

imx53-qsb.dts:

		periph_apm: clkmux-periph_apm@0x53fd4018 {
			current_parent = <&pll3>
		};


So the entry in imx53-qsb.dts is used to describe what a board wants
and not what the current status is.

I think yes. On i.MX processors you only need dividers, gates, muxes and
plls. On other SoCs there may be table based dividers, power-of-2
dividers or similar stuff, but overall there should be a quite limited
set of features to be described.

Describing the clock tree in the device tree also makes it possible for
a board to customize the divider/PLL/mux settings.
Consider a SoC with a PLL where several different devices can derive its
clock from.  One board may want to move all other devices away from this
PLL and use it exclusively for sound to get an exact rate. Another might
use it for the pixel clock and a third one selects a good compromise
between an exact sound clock and the pixel clock. Not describing this in
the device tree means that we need board specific code with
clk_get/clk_get_parent/clk_set_rate orgies. 
I gave up on creating clock code that magically tries to do everything
right based on clk_* functions. With the example above how should the
clock code know how to adjust the mentioned PLL? If you managed to get
it right for one SoC the next totally different SoC will already be in
the pipeline.
