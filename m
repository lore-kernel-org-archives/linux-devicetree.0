Well, keep in mind that there's no specific patch adding SMP support.
The patch here contains *all* of the actual code that goes through
mach-bcm. The rest will go through Russell.

Given what was missed, if we drop just this patch, we're left with just
the DT, Kconfig, and MAINTAINERS changes. It doesn't seem like there's
time to fix the problems now. It might be better to drop the whole
series from arm-soc since it won't be functional in 3.17 if we drop
just this patch. I'd like to see what Arnd and Olof think. I think
there's value in leaving all the DT bits for 3.17.
