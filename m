This patch series remodels the FlexCAN register r/w APIs for big endian.
The endianness is checked based on optional big-endian property in
device tree. if this property is not present in device tree node then 
controller is assumed to be little endian. if this property is present then
controller is assumed to be big endian.

An exception to this rule is powerpc P1010RDB, which is always
big-endian, even if big-endian is not present in dts. This is
checked using p1010-flexcan compatible in dts.

Therefore, remove p1010-flexcan compatible from imx series dts,
as their flexcan core is little endian.

Finally this series adds support for NXP LS1021A SOC in flexcan,
which is arm based SOC having big-endian FlexCAN controller.
