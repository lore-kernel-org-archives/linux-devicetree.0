It seems like quite a surprising bug to me, and AFAIK there's nothing
already upstream that requires a similar WAR.

It sounds like Eric's latest plan is to put the one WAR into the
bcm2835-specific IRQ controller driver. Assuming we don't find any
unusual code elsewhere, we shouldn't need to put WARs all over the place.

Doing a single dsb at the start of the IRQ handler should be enough,
assuming that the code consumes each read result in a control path
before issuing another readl_relaxed, there will never be multiple reads
outstanding.
