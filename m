Oops, good point Rob.

OK, I'm happy to merge the whole enchilada.

I'd prefer not to stagger, as it just adds unnecessary delay to getting
things upstream. And the code being merged first (the binding doc +
header) is fairly useless on its own.

Do you mean you prefer to declare the magic numbers in the binding
description directly instead of using a header and relying on the C code
to stay in sync?

Or do you mean that there is no reason to declare the constants/magic
numbers in a shared way at all?

Well, I'm thinking that an immutable branch isn't such a bad idea given
that both you and Rob are OK with subsystems merging headers and binding
descriptions.

A while back Stephen Boyd and I started to use topic branches for every
driver, all based on -rc1 and merging those into clk-next. This makes it
trivial for us to push a shareable branch with minimal dependencies.

So at least for the clk tree, how do you feel about us merging driver +
header + binding description and then sharing our topic branch as-needed
with arm-soc? We could even push our topic branches by default to cut
down on coordinating over email back-and-forth.

As an example, patch #1 from the Hi3519 series[0] includes the clk
driver, binding description and a shared header. Any objection to me
taking that patch as-is, based on -rc1, and pushing out that topic
branch as clk-hi3519 to the clk git tree with the expectation that
you'll just merge that if you need to?

You can let me know if you've pulled it in, and then I won't rebase
without consulting with the arm-soc folks first.

Does this workflow agreement Solve All the Problems?

(Note that the patch I referenced is still under review so the branch
name I mentioned above doesn't exist yet. It is just an example)
