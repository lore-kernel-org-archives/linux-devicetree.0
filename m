Sorry, my bad, you are right.

We need to define it properly for ARM, I am not sure we can use level
as defined in CLIDR, I need to think more about this.

Ok, I will try to update the bindings with the interrupt part and copy
you in, even though the level definition worries me a bit, it is an
important property for power management and I need to find a proper
solution before bindings can get accepted (basically the problem is:
if different CPUs can see a cache at different levels as defined in the
CLIDR we cannot describe a cache with a single cache level or put it
differently, level can not represent the value in the CLIDR hence we
need to describe it differently).
