Yes, the connection is as your imagination, except for each DMA has two MUX. 
The DMA helper looks the registered DMA engineer for DMA channel binding,
and the registered DMA engineer is the eDMA node, if binding to DMAMUX,
the helper will not find out the dma engineer.
The only DMAMUX configuration is programming the slave id into its
corresponding register, so its code is handled by the eDMA driver,
the DMAMUX is not optional.
Thanks!
