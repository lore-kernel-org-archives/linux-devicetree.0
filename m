This patch series is done as a preparatory step for adding phy drivers
for dwc3 and musb.

This series adds a new driver for ocp2scp (only dt) to which phy
drivers are connected.

Since currently there is no generic way to create a child device along
with doing a pm_runtime_enable (the exact requirement for ocp2scp), i'm
sending this second rfc patch with only dt support. If we can figure out
a way to do that generically this patch series can be dropped and I'll
send a patch only for adding dt data.

*arm: omap: hwmod: make *phy_48m* as the main_clk of ocp2scp* and
*arm: omap: remove ocp2scp_usb_phy_ick clock node* patches are removed
from the series as Benoit is planning to take it up in his series.

This series was developed on
http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb.git usb-next

and [RFC PATCH 00/11] OMAP System Control Module (There is no direct
dependencies with this patch series).

However to test this patch series, the following patch series is needed
[PATCH v7 0/3] usb: multi-phy support
[PATCH v3 0/5] usb: musb: cleanup
[RFC PATCH 00/11] OMAP System Control Module
[RFC PATCH 00/10] omap: musb: Add device tree support (To be sent)
