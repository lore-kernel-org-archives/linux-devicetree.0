Ok, then it looks like the property description is a little confusing.
I'd remove the mentioning of HDMI exchanges from it.

Ok, this is a classic case where the binding should describe how
things are configured/wired up instead of hardcoding a register value
like this. From the data sheet there seems to be a _lot_ of settings,
so selecting the needed subset for now might be acceptable (and go
with defaults on the rest).
