Bin, Please do not apply dts or arch/arm/mach-davinci patches. I have a
bunch queued through my tree and more in pipeline and it will cause
unnecessary merge conflicts in linux-next or at Linus.

For future, I have asked Alexandre to send driver and dts patches as
separate series so there is no confusion on who should apply.

Thanks,
Sekhar
