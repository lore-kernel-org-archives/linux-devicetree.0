However, to the best of my understanding, that effort is currently not in the bluetooth-next git repo. As Marcel told me earlier this year, "if it is not in the bluetooth-next, it does not exist". I'm afraid I can't use it therefore. Also, we need to ship this driver sooner rather than later. The integration with the UART slave devices sounds like a worthwhile future enhancement to me.

If you merged this and then used the UART slave devices later, then
you have to support both bindings as the bindings are an ABI. We have
enough cases of that because we did not have the foresight to avoid
it. In this case we do. You have not given me any reason why other
than timing and that's not a valid reason.

So you need 2 values or not?

The Broadcom however have a spec describing what needs to be done to integrate these kinds of chips on hardware platforms (for Windows). Anybody who wishes to use SCO PCM audio will need to read that spec. These parameter names are from that spec. A lot of additional technical info Is there, along with various diagrams. It can't be all placed in this help file. Of course, I can change these parameter names but it would make things harder for those wishing to use the hardware as they would not match the spec. Could you make an exception?

I think humans are capable to translate. Besides, I don't really care
so much what is in Broadcom's spec (besides the fact I probably don't
have access). What I care about is what does the PCM configuration
look like for the next BT uart chip with a DT binding that comes
along. I don't want to see $vendor specific fields just dumped into DT
as is with no regard to whether things should be common. Some of this
is pretty Broadcom specific, but much of it is standard PCM/I2S audio
configuration.
