Yes, but what do you do with the 0 result then in your PLL initialization?

No, you can't rely on that. The order of the device nodes may happen to
define the order of clock initialization now, but that may change.
device nodes are usually ordered by bus addresses, not by intended
initialization order. Even if you reorder them everything must still
work.

Appearantly you don't know the (input) frequency of the PLL when
registering it to the framework, so the question must be: What's wrong
with keeping it uninitialized?

If the PLL is unused then you don't care about it's initialization
status. If it happens to be enabled by a bootloader and still unused
at late_initcall time the clock framework will disable it so you
have a known state then. If a consumer for the PLL appears it's its
job to initialize it through the clk api.
