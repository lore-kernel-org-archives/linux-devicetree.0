I agree with you.
Moving the compatibility code to the core from the individual drivers
looks good. :-)

On Exynos side, I have never seen that FB_BLANK_VSYNC_SUSPEND,
FB_BLANK_HSYNC_SUSPEND are used for controlling display panels or
Display controllers.

However, I heard that FB_BLANK_VSYNC_SUSPEND, FB_BLANK_HSYNC_SUSPEND are
used for some monitors.
