We have a single mod0 clock in there, so no, not really.

Plus, that seems like a bogus limitation from MFD, and it really
shouldn't work that way.

Then add the simple-bus compatible.

47 lines that are doing exactly the same thing as the other code is
doing. I'm sorry but you can't really argue it's not code duplication,
it really is.

The whole EPROBE_DEFER mechanism might need some fixing, but it's not
really the point is it?
