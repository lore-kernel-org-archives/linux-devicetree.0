My stance always has been to preserve ATAG support for legacy platforms.  
I think we have enough work already trying to convert modern platforms 
to DT without bothering with the older ones with non-updatable 
bootloaders.  This ability to append a DTB to the kernel is simply a 
convenience to let people use DT with non DT aware bootloaders, or even 
to override the DTB passed by the bootloader which is unavoidably going 
to be broken in some cases.  Of course the restriction in that case is 
that you'll need to recreate that appended DTB whenever you wish to 
change a parameter.  I don't consider this to be the main mode of 
operation though.

No, please let's not go there.  Having competing sources of information 
is the best recipe to madness.  Which one is authoritative?  What if we 
need to have the override going in the other direction?  We should be 
fully with ATAGS, or fully with DT, not a mixture of both.

All the newer PXAs are using U-Boot which is now DT aware.  If a legacy 
bootloader must be used, then it is always possible to add a shim to 
zImage translating selected ATAGs into DT records.  A patch for doing 
just that exists already and was posted on the list by Grant.  However I 
prefer if it is used only when absolutely needed and not by default 
otherwise we lose all possible leverage on bootloader authors to move to 
DT (the fact that the DT append patch still doesn't let you change the 
cmdline live is also part of that leverage).

It is not pointless.  Never it was in the cards to convert old platforms 
first.  The most problematic platforms responsible for the high volume 
of changes that has gone in mainline lately are the modern ones, not PXA 
based ones.  So DT is going to be most effective for the new stuff to 
come.  And realistically that's where we might get developers attention, 
not with those platforms being end-of-lived by their manufacturers.

I don't think the DT append patch is suitable for such a usage scenario, 
unless you are ready to swap the appended DTB with another one in that 
case.  Or you simply can just drop the appended DTB in which case the 
kernel will use the ATAGs instead.

If you really want to use DT on that platform and still benefit from the 
ATAG information passed by the bootloader, then you could use the 
translation shim that exists.  That, of course, is assuming that you do 
have DT support for that platform in the kernel which, like I said, is 
unlikely to happen for old platforms unless someone really enthusiastic 
invest some time in the required work.

My answer: if it isn't broken, don't fix it.  In other words, I have not 
seen huge development activities around the N2100 for quite a while.  
It is not responsible for a significant increase of kernel code anymore, 
if at all. So there is no point moving it to DT especially in a 
production setup.
