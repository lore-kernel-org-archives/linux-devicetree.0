I think all DT references that take the form of <&phandle arg1 ...>
are problematic because in ACPI the same things tend to expressed
by a single number (irq, dma, gpio, ...) or just a reference with
no arguments (don't have an example here).

Another difference is things that are numbered on one side but
named on the other. In DT we  have an inconsistent mix of the two,
e.g. DMA requests must be named (per device) while IRQs must be
numbered (per device) and may additionally be named. 

Finally, anything that needs run-time interpretation of AML is
fundamentally hard because the AML would refer to objects that
don't exist when you don't boot from ACPI. This gets worse if you
need to pass ACPI identifiers into EL3 firmware. Because of this,
anything related to runtime PM scares me at the moment, because
there are two conflicting ways to do it: As we discussed before,
the correct way to do this in ACPI is to hide it all from the OS
in AML bytecode and EL2/EL3 firmware calls, but this may not be
possible on all systems and it prevents us from translating into
a format that the drivers can use to call our
regulator/clk/pmdomain interfaces.
Intel's embedded systems will likely get around this by defining
ACPI representations of our existing DT bindings for these
subsystems, which would be possible to translate automatically,
but it seems very silly to use those on servers.

Yes. Especially for the runtime-pm stuff, someone should probably try
both methods on a couple of systems and then decide which one of them
everybody should use. Unfortunately that alone is going to bind
reviewer resources and take a significant amount of time.

Possibly, but x86 extending into deeply embedded may also have different
requirements to ARM extending into servers, even if both want to use
ACPI to get there. Some parts will overlap, others won't, and I suspect
that there is more in the second category than people are hoping for.

Right: the assumption on the DT boot interfaces is that board designers
make mistakes and are working on moving targets, so we need ways to update
the DTB. By contrast, the assumption on ACPI is that server firmware
authors know what they are doing and you shouldn't let anyone else mess
with the ACPI bits because doing so might damage your hardware. We're
in trouble if the second assumption turns out wrong.

Yes, the only real worry is if someone does their own firmware interfaces
the way that Sony did on the PS3, which definitely requires custom
APIs in the kernel. All others can be handled in some way by ignoring
the provided interfaces and replacing them with DT. We might need some
boot wrapper for cases where someone ignored the documented boot
interfaces, but that would only be likely for systems designed for
another OS.
