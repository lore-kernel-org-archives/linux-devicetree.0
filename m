You don't need to set this for the DT based machines, this number
is just for the set of IRQ that have a hardcoded mapping. With DT,
they get dynamically allocated as required.

=46or the board files, you can hardcode the original definition of 32
IRQs, but I think you don't need that if you register a legacy IRQ
domain in mach-w90x900/irq.c.

This does not look right when NUC900_NR_IRQS can have configuration
dependent values. I can see two ways of handling it:

a) register the maximum number of IRQs that the irqchip can handle.
   There is no real cost for having a large number here, as SPARSE_IRQ
   ensures we only need to allocate the descriptors that are actually
   used.

b) make the number of interrupts dependent on the compatible string
   for the irqchip, and handle NUC970 differently from the others
   in the driver.

In the meantime, I also have a series to enable multiplatform support
for all of mach-w90x900 based on your patches, but lacking a proper
clk driver. I'll send that to you so you can include it in your
series (after verifying that it works, or fixing it where necessary).
