It would help if this took a struct device_node rather than struct 
device. This would allow using of_clk_get directly for cases where you 
don't have a struct device. This is fairly common in core platform core 
which are not full drivers. The case I have run into is the timer init 
code. To make clk_get work, I would have to create a dummy struct device.

Alternatively, an of_clk_get_sys function is needed.

Many times a module just has 1 clock and id will be NULL. Is "bus-clock" 
really the best choice of name? A bus clock may exist, but be 
transparent to s/w. How about allowing "clock" or "%s-clock"?

If bus-clock is the default, then you should add this to the clock 
binding wiki page.
