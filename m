Totally agreed.

Right.

And I'm not sure why that was regarded as a good enough reason to do it.

Yes, they did.

Well, I was suggesting to use an opt-in flag there, but I'm not sure if Tomeu
took that into consideration.

In any case, probing is just one aspect of a deeper issue, which is that
we have no way to represent functional dependencies between devices.
