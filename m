Not exactly...
board/compulab/cm_fx6 is the one.
That is off topic for this list, so we'd better go off list on this.

:-) no accidents here...

Interesting... off list.

Of course. You have my email.

U-Boot support is upstream already since v2014.10.

Right. I agree completely. I guess there are some historical reasons
back to the MTD subsystem 'invention'.
