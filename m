Putting the objects somewhere other than /sys/devices sounds good, yes.
This would also help with TEE implementations that might get probed
differently.

I think the natural place would be /sys/class/tee/, as we normally
require something in /sys/class anyway to support the character
device.

/sys/firmware/tee/ sounds less fitting, as there other TEE implementations
are not necessarily firmware based, as you point out. 
/sys/firmware/op-tee certainly makes sense for anything that is specific
to OP-TEE in particular, while /sys/class/tee would be for anything
that uses the ioctl interface. This part is particularly important to
get right from the start, just like the ioctls themselves we can't make
incompatible changes here later once there are users relying on the
upstream kernel interfaces.

Ok, makes sense.
