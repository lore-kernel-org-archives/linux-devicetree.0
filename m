So as and when you believe you need to break a binding, we can have a
discussion on that case-by-case basis.

That's different to stating that the usual rules don't apply at all,
which is black-and-white stand I'm referring to.

Then _support_ what you have upstreamed already. Either it's ready to be
supported or it is not. If it is, there's no need for DT breakage, and
if it isn't, then it's not ready for mainline. That's all this boils
down to. 

If it must go in, then it must be supported.

It's not "progressively getting better", if DTBs are arbitrarily getting
broken.

It's possible to incrementally add support without having to break
existing DTBs.

The parsing and handling of the existing binding is code, which you are
arguing you do not need to support.

I do not follow what you mean by support being *not sane*. If it isn't
sane, why was it merged?

If it was previously considered sane, and the code was considered
supportable, why is it necessary to break a DT that it supported?

A few examples:

* Distro installation (in the absence of a stable DT and a consistent
  boot environment, you have no idea how to get a kernel up and
  running). Either your user has to be intimately familiar with the
  platform, or the distro needs a separate release for each and every
  platform.

* Distro maintenance. I just upgraded to a point-release kernel and now
  have to pull down the DTBs. That required the distro to _somehow_
  identify the relevant DTBs, how to install this in the correct
  location such that the firmware and/or bootloader can pick it up, etc.

* Other developers tracking down problems that inevitable crop up on the
  platform, who now have to jump through the hoops above. As the DTBs
  change, so may the user-facing elements and/or kernel behaviour, so
  bisecting is extremely painful (though admittedly possible).

  Notice that in this case, the user has to go back in time for their
  starting point. So it doesn't matter if they're not a user _yet_.

* Portable hypervisors, bootloaders, or other system-level software
  can't add any (DTB-aware) support for a platform until the kernel
  support is considered "sane" per your argument above. That time is an
  arbitrary unknown in the future (which may be at infinity), so they
  are either indefinitely delayed or end up having attempt to have
  stable support for a variety of unstable bindings anyway, which may or
  may not be possible depending on how bindings got broken.

These may not affect _you_ directly, but they do hinder realistic
user-facing support.

This is a _symptom_ of the problem. Read this as:

	Even Fedora _have to_ install DTBs in a directory that is
	kernel-version specific!

Notice how that does not sound great. Distros are being _forced_ to do
this because stuff gets broken. As covered above, this doesn't always
work anyway, so it's really not an argument in favour of breaking
things.

Thanks,
Mark.
