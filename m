Subject: [PATCH v2] arm64: dts: qcom: Add apq8096 dragonboard dts skeletons
Date: Tue,  1 Dec 2015 21:41:15 +0530
Message-ID: <1448986275-16807-1-git-send-email-rnayak@codeaurora.org>
Return-path: <linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
To: agross@codeaurora.org
Cc: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org, linux-arm-msm@vger.kernel.org, linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org, devicetree@vger.kernel.org, sboyd@codeaurora.org, Rajendra Nayak <rnayak@codeaurora.org>
List-Id: devicetree@vger.kernel.org

Add new dtsi and dts files for the apq8096 dragonboards with just
a serial device used as debug console

While at it, also rearrange the Makefile so we have one dtb per line
so as to be consistent with whats done on other platforms.
