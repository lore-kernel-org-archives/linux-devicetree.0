I need to check that it doesn't break rebinding to the host after VFIO
has been used for passthrough, first.

Does your devicetree explicitly assign a StreamID to the platform device
for the host controller? We should probably be handling this, since it
will crop us as an issue again once we decide to enable the default
domain properly.

Using the generic iommu binding
(Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/iommu.txt), which will be required
for of_xlate-based probing. The old binding should still continue to
function as it always has, though.
