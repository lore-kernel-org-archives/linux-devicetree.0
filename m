I would go further and forbid it.

"Configuring a clock parent and rate through the device node that uses the
clock can be done only for clocks that have a single user. Specifying 
conflicting parent or rate configuration in multiple consumer nodes for a 
shared clock is forbidden."

Sascha has posted a nice example of an assigned-clocks node, let's discuss 
this in replies to his e-mail.
