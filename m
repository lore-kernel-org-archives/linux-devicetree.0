What do you mean by "drop"?
cpu-volts = <
	/* min  max */
	1100000 1200000 /* 1G HZ */
	1000000 1200000 /* 800M HZ */
	900000  1200000 /* 600M HZ */
	>;
The above sample dts could meet your point?

accepted seting voltage range. I guess the above sample dts code meet your

I'll use regulator_is_supported_voltage pre-check the cpu-volts.
For clock, conditions ((clk_round_rate(cpu-freq)/1000) * 1000 == cpu-freq)
seems too strict. Because cpu clock is SoC dependent, I'll not add the check.

hmm, cpu table dumps it with pr_debug.
