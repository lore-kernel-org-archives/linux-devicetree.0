Please specify the order they must be in.

Why should this be in the DT?

Surely the driver should be in charge of deciding when to use these?

These don't seem like they belong either. Surely this would depend on
the request made, rather than being a fixed property?

This sounds like it might belong in the DT.

What do we do elsewhere in terms of describing prioritisation? It feels
like it would be a dynamic property of the system.

What does this mean?

What does this mean?

As with the other interrupt configuration, this does not look like it
belongs in the DT.

Thanks,
Mark.
