The properties listed in the example must all be either
defined as "required" or "optional" properties and have a
description.

The reg property here is a bit odd, as it lists two consecutive
4-byte areas, and both are suspiciously close to a round
address (0x40400000), so I would guess that they are
in fact part of a clock controller with several registers.

If so, please define a node for the entire clock controller,
the DT description should reflect the design of the hardware
rather than the design of your device driver.

"arbitrary" is not a good word to use in a specification document ;-)

Are there no constraints whatsoever on the allowed values? How
many bits are there?

This sounds like it should just be the denominator, you can add
or subtract one in the driver.

I think the compatible value should refer to at least some more
specific product that uses these: I would guess that there are
some chips that spreadtrum has made that have clock gates
which are not compatible with this.

Can all three appear in the same chip, or would you always
have only one of them?

For clock-output-names, please drop the "clk_" prefix from each
identifier, and maybe use '-' instead of '_' as the separator.
