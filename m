Hmm, I haven't seen any of the ARM platforms doing this, and unless the 
sa1110 bus has some extra knobs that need tweaking, then simple-bus 
should be fine.

Ahh, I wasn't aware of that one - thanks!

Yup, that looks about right.

OK, I guess that's fair enough, though I certainly shouldn't be 
considered an authoritative source on this!
