And in x86 land these days, they mostly don't screw it up because they've been
doing this for years and years. On ARM we've got a dozen new vendors who have
never done any of this before (and neither have we), and we're all going to
screw it up. Denying that buys us nothing, planning for it in a manner that we
can recover from the worst screwups without paying for it forever is the best
way forward.

Well, duh, that was what we, as the kernel community, had mandated at
the time.

Everything is a moving target on ARMv8 today. ACPI isn't going to change that.
