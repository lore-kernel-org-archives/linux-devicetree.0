Ok, good. There are some dmaengine drivers that actually behave
in hardware like the virtual-channel extension, i.e. they have
one physical channel per request line (qcom_bam_dma seems to be
one of them in fact), so they don't really have a choice.

The way that both the DT and ACPI bindings are structured,
the request ID is always known by the time the channel is
allocated to allow this model, and that means supporting both
approaches in the same master or slave driver is a mess.
