I'm fairly certain that "model" doesn't belong in the SoC .dtsi file.
Only in the board .dts file.

Just to make it explicit: see my comments in patch 3/3 in this series
about using "_" in node names.  I believe this should be:

  xo_board: xo-board {


> +               spmi_bus: qcom,spmi@c440000 {

Drop the qcom in the node name.  AKA, I believe this should be:

spmi_bus: spmi@c440000 {

Specifically the node name is supposed to be a generic component name
then with an address.  I see that Rob Herring said the same thing when
he reviewed v1 of this patch just now (it seems like people are still
commenting there, so make sure you collect the latest feedback from
there when re-spinning).
