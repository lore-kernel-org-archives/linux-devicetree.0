Example?

I would think the binding would be done in a way that we don't
have to describe every little register in this misc register
block. Instead, dfx server has a compatible:

 node@f00 {
 	reg = <0xf00 0x100>;
	compatible = "marvell,dfx-ap806";
	#clock-cells = <1>;
 };

And then a driver that probes this compatible string and
registers a handful of clks. If we ever get into a situation
where we want to expose non-clk functionality from this device
node, we would make some sort of mfd driver that probes based on
the same compatible string and creates platform devices in
software to register the clk device component and whatever other
device type is used. In that situation, we could assign a regmap
to the mfd device and the clk device would be a child of the mfd
and get a regmap through the dev->parent pointer.

TL;DR I'm still lost why we have to describe each clk in DT.
