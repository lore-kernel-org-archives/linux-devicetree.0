I'm requesting comments on this patch series. The changes in this patch 
series are based upon feedback from Mark Rutland for patch series 
version 5 on December 2, 2014.

I believe this patch set addresses the concerns that Mark had with my 
previous patch. Primarily, syscon was removed from the L2 cache and a 
top level device tree node with L2 and OCRAM children is used instead of 
individual top level nodes. Some concerns were addressed in an email 
reply on December 2, 2014.

This change also created a new edac parent probe function which is in 
[PATCHv6 4/5] which should be reviewed along with this device tree change.

Thanks,

Thor
