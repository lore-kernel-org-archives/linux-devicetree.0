Subject: [PATCH v3 1/3] ARM: dts: imx: Pass empty memory size on board dts
Date: Wed, 24 Jan 2018 11:22:12 -0200
Message-ID: <1516800134-5018-1-git-send-email-marcofrk@gmail.com>
Return-path: <linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
To: shawnguo@kernel.org, robh+dt@kernel.org
Cc: LW@karo-electronics.de, linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org, devicetree@vger.kernel.org, festevam@gmail.com, marcofrk@gmail.com, Marco Franchi <marco.franchi@nxp.com>
List-Id: devicetree@vger.kernel.org

In preparation for removing 'reg = <0 0>;' from the dtsi SoC files, pass
'reg = <0 0 >;' to the dts/dtsi board files that do not pass the memory
size.
