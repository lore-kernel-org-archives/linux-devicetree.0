Very appreciate for Mike's summary. It's shame for me this is one thing
I should do better :)

So we can add below code before really access another other registers
are possible in CPU power domain:

        /*
         * Force to power on CPU power domain and assert
         * DBGPWRUPREQ signal
         */
        val = readl(drvdata->base + EDPRCR);
        val |= BIT(3);
        writel(val, drvdata->base + EDPRCR);

I tried to digest these info and below are my understanding from your
suggestion:

### For boot time: add two command line flags

- coresight.cpu_debug: this flag is used to enable cpu debug module at
  boot time, and it relys on sane hardware design (like PRCR can works
  well) to access registers;

- coresight.cpu_debug_pwrup: this flag is used to enable cpu debug
  module at boot time, and it cannot relys on PRCR anymore so we need
  manually constraint CPU power states;

### For runtime: use one sysfs node

- Create sysfs node:
  /sys/kernel/debug/coresight_cpu_debug/enable_debug

  echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/coresight_cpu_debug/enable_debug: same
  functionality with boot time's 'coresight.cpu_debug';

  echo 2 > /sys/kernel/debug/coresight_cpu_debug/enable_debug: same
  functionality with boot time's 'coresight.cpu_debug_pwrup';

  echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/coresight_cpu_debug/enable_debug: disable
  debug functionality.

Does this make sense?

Thanks,
