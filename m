For the issue I care about, it's not hard to have perfection. Why
wouldn't I want that.

Reading your comments below, I think we're talking about slightly
different aspects of the problem though.

Sure. I have no problem at all if the kernel implemnts a "make
dtbs_install" target. It certainly should.

OK, if you're arguing that there should be absolutely zero renaming at
all under any circumstances, I'm fine with that.

My argument was that the proposed renaming step (renaming the DTBs based
on the top-level compatible) is not appropriate for Tegra, even if it is
what some other platforms might want. My issue could be addressed by any of:

a) Never renaming anything. I believe this is what you're arguing for.

b) Having some kind of in-kernel list of DTs that do get renamed, and
those that don't. Tegra DTs would be in the latter don't-rename list.

c) Simply renaming any DT source files in the kernel that are perceived
to have the wrong name currently, rather than renaming during each "make
dtbs_install". Tegra DTs currently have the correct name, so wouldn't be
renamed.

I'm fine with any of those solutions. (a) or (c) seem simplest to me.

For the record, I was never talking about the kernel selecting a
particular DTB to install, or a particular DTB for a target. I assume
that "make dtbs_install" always installs all DTBs that the kernel built.
The discussion in this thread has been about (re-)naming not selecting
DTBs. It's up to some out-of-kernel process to pick which (or all) of
those to actually use.
