In some discussion with Robin, since it's just RPi4 that we are aware of
having such requirement on arm64, he suggested that we have a permanent
ZONE_DMA on arm64 with a default size of 1GB. It should cover all arm64
SoCs we know of without breaking the single Image binary. The arch/arm
can use its current mach-* support.

I may like this more than the proposed early_init_dt_get_dma_zone_size()
here which checks for specific SoCs (my preferred way was to build the
mask from all buses described in DT but I hadn't realised the
complications).
