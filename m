That covers the public API, but I do not understand how you intended
for this data to be stored in the rbtree if the use of a dirty bitmask
is discouraged.

i.e. regcache_sync() finds a register value marked "present".  How do
we know whether we need to write it back to the hardware?  For the
special case of "cached non default register values immediately after
a HW reset" you can mostly figure this out, but if there was no HW
reset how do we know which entries changed while the HW was
inaccessible?

This seems to be solving a different problem.  It sounds like you are
more worried about regcache_sync() writing back lots of default values
for registers that were never touched, than performing unnecessary
writes to a few (actively used) registers that weren't changed while
we were in cache_only mode.  Is that accurate?

FWIW, in the current iteration of the tas571x driver, there are few if
any registers that meet this criteria.
