I think that would work, though I don't think you really need an
error response in this case.

I was thinking more just a timeout in the write function.  Ideally
the timeout would be calculated at receive time and then be
passed in on every write, to preserve the request-to-response
time for slow messages.  I like the simplicity of the driver the
way it is.

The trouble is that there is no easy way to pass in a timeout
in a write operation.  You could pass in a structure where the
first part is a 32-bit timeout, or something like that.  Or
maybe just a fixed timeout and assume every message is
handled in a short enough time that it meets the spec
requirement.  But that doesn't handle slowness on the
host side.  You can send the message via an ioctl,  which
again isn't terribly ideal.

It would be nice if there was a write function which was
able to pass metadata, but AFAIK that's only available on
sockets.

I'm fine either way.
