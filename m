Hi,

While looking in MFD drivers I saw that few of them (88pm860x-core,
max8925-core and wm831x-core) allow use of IORESOURCE_REG as resource
type when calling  platform_get_resource() by their child drivers. The
resources for these child devices are filled by core MFD driver manually
and then passed to mfd_add_devices() as mfd_cells.

During development and review comments of the MFD core driver for
Qualcomm SPMI PMICs we came down to a need to describe PMIC peripheral
addresses (the PMIC sub-functions) through *reg* property in DT. The
PMIC peripheral drivers will be scattered over the /drivers and they
will call platform_get_resource() to extract their peripheral base
addresses from resource->start. The issue we have encountered is that
these addresses are non-translatable thus of_address_to_resource returns
OF_BAD_ADDR.

Stephen Boyd have made a suggestion to solve the issue here [1].

Is that approach acceptable? Or do we have better way? How similar
issues could be solved.

Our DT node for SPMI PMICs can be seen below [2].

Please do comment.

PS: I have made a little change in __of_address_to_resource() to
illustrate what I meant above.
