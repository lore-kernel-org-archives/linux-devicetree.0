Sorry if I my question was unclear, I did not mean the implementation
of this phy in hix5hd2, but the Synopsys phy itself. I was mainly
asking because of the "compatible" string, which should otherwise
not include "sata" but be more generic.

Since you mention that this is a synopsys part, it may however be
good to also define a compatible string for the generic device,
to allow other SoCs to share this driver, and to make it easier
for people to find out that we already have one so they don't have
to write another driver for the same hardware.

Can you find out what the Synopsys/Designware product designation for
this PHY is? It would be good to rename the driver and binding
if possible. I would still recommend leaving the
"hisilicon,hix5hd2-sata-phy" string and the "hisilicon,peripheral-syscon"
property in place, since that indicates a minor variation of the
generic part.
