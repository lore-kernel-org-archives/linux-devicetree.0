At least the one in the drivers/clk/clk.c does:

660 int clk_prepare(struct clk *clk)
661 {
662         int ret;
663
664         if (!clk)
665                 return 0;
...
774 int clk_enable(struct clk *clk)
775 {
776         unsigned long flags;
777         int ret;
778
779         if (!clk)
780                 return 0;

I see. Let's wait then.
