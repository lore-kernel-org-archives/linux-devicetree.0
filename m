I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. I haven't worked with
eDP panels in a while, but my recollection is that you can use DP AUX to
read video timings over EDID. We provide support for that by exporting a
DP AUX controller as I2C adapter (i.e. register with the I2C subsystem)
and then that I2C adapter can be used to read the EDID. I wasn't aware
that eDP panels additionally stored the video timings somewhere else.

What I meant above was that aside from the I2C-over-AUX for reading the
EDID, this driver doesn't do anything else with DP AUX in order to turn
the panel on. Looking at the eDP support we have on Tegra, there's a
DPCD register (DP_SET_POWER) that needs to be written in order to take
the sink device (i.e. panel) out of the power saving state. We do that
as part of the connector implementation rather than within the panel
driver. There are also additional registers such as DP_LINK_BW_SET that
need to be programmed. I think this is also relevant to regular DP and
detailed in the specification.

Given all the above, I'm beginning to think that Rob's right in that
perhaps we shouldn't be treating eDP panels as panels, but rather to
make them look more like DP monitors and make all this code part of the
connector implementation. I think pretty much the only differences to
regular DP are that we might require some lower-level resources that a
DP monitor would usually have built-in (reset or power GPIOs, power
supplies, backlight, ...).

I'm not sure if that's enough for eDP panels, though. For example the
AUO B133HTN01 panel, used by the exynos5800-peach-pi, seems to be an eDP
panel. But the driver also specifies a couple of additional delays which
suggests that either it violates the eDP specification or that the eDP
specification doesn't define any power sequencing delays that would've
been needed. Or perhaps these delays are specified somewhere and the
driver just doesn't use them?
