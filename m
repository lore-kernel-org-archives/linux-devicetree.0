I'm not sure about the structure you suggest. The main reason we'd want
to tell apart multiple reset GPIOs (via reset-gpio-names) would be that
the device needs to have said GPIOs poked in a device-specific manner
(i.e. with some ordering and timing constraints, possibly only a subset
of the GPIOs needing to be poked to reset components of the device).

Given that, I'm not sure what separating the GPIOs out into a
reset-gpios property buys us, as the driver still needs to handle them
(at least to provide some additional information to device reset
framework code).

I was working on the assumption that any required delay would be a
function of the devices input clocks (or fixed, if the device has some
fixed rate internal clock). If that's true, the API extension you
suggest makes sense to me.

I'm not sure about initially-in-reset. Is it not possible for the driver
to poke the GPIO controller to ensure the GPIOs are in the state
required?

Thanks,
Mark.
