Hi all,

Let me begin admitting that we are introducing yet another protocol to
achieve same things as many existing protocols like ARM SCPI, TI SCI,
QCOM RPM, Nvidia Tegra BPMP, and so on.

All I can say is that this new ARM System Control and Management
Interface(SCMI) is more flexible and easily extensible than any of the
existing ones. Many vendors were involved in the making of this formal
specification and is now officially published[1].

There is a strong trend in the industry to provide micro-controllers in
systems to abstract various power, or other system management tasks.
These controllers usually have similar interfaces, both in terms of the
functions that are provided by them, and in terms of how requests are
communicated to them.

This specification is to standardise and avoid (any further)
fragmentation in the design of such interface by various vendors.

This patch set is intended to get feedback on the design and structure
of the code. This is not complete and not fully tested due to
non-availability of firmware with full feature set at this time.

It currently doesn't support notification, asynchronous/delayed response,
perf/power statistics region and sensor register region to name a few.
I have borrowed some of the ideas of message allocation/management from
TI SCI.


Changes:

v2[4]->v3:
	- Addressed various comments recieved so far(clock, hwmon and
	  cpufreq drivers along with scmi drivers)
	- Hwmon driver now uses core layer to create and manage sysfs
	  attributes
	- Added a shim layer to abstract the mailbox interface to support
	  any custom adaptation required by the controller driver
	- Simple ARM MHU shim layer using newly added abstraction


v1[3]->v2[4]:
	- Additional support for polling based DVFS and per protocol
	  channels
	- Dependent drivers(clock, hwmon, cpufreq and power domains)
	- Various other review comments and issued found during testing
	  addressed
	- Explicit binding for method dropped as even SMC based method
	  are adviertised as mailbox

RFC[2]->v1[3]:
	- Add generic mailbox binding for shared memory(Rob H)
	- Dropped compatibles per protocol(Suggested by Matt S)
	- Dropped lot of unnecessary pointer casting(Arnd B)
	- Dropped packing of structures(Arnd B)
	- Few other changes/additions based initial testing with firmware
	  providing SCMI interface to OSPM
