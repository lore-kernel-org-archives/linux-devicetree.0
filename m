Just have a case for glue layer needs to know core layer's status.
The controller's wakeup logic is usually at glue layer, but we
may need to enable different wakeup for roles. Eg, if the current
role is host (controller is otg capable), we can't enable id wakeup,
otherwise, the user will complain plug out Micro-AB cable wakes up
system which is not expected.
