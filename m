Hi Samuel,

if nobody has objections I think this set is ready to get merged. As
Nico mentioned in:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2013-June/173541.html

since we would like to get it merged through the ARM SoC tree owing to
dependencies between this code and ARM power management back-ends, your ack
would be appreciated, if you think it is worth it of course.

Thank you very much indeed,
Lorenzo
