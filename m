These are HW bus parameters like the burst count and 
size of each burst. These values change based on the SoC this IP is in use.

You can starve other peripherals if you use incorrect values as the bus is 
shared with other peripherals. Yes, correctness is required.

Correct value is necessary for functioning. I'd consider weight and priority
as the only tuning parameters.

Good catch. Those should have been read-only. I wanted to be able to export these
information to the userspace app. I'll fix the sysfs to make them read-only.

After each reset command, HW starts a timer. This is the time HW waits before it declares
reset failed.

Replaced the above paragraph with yours.
