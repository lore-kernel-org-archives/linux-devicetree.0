Hi Ganapat,
The above caught my attention.

For a 4-node system do we not need 16 distances; the implication of that
would be that the distance between node A-B could be different from the
distance between B-A? Also the distance from a node to itself could be
safely assumed to be zero?

I think we should have a symmetric matrix with zero-diagonals so strictly
only seven values would need specifying for a 4-node system.

Cheers,
