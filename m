Yes, I agree, I think the bindings we came up with are neater than
having threads as multiple reg properties in cpu nodes and adding cluster
nodes (within cpus node or elsewhere). On the interrupt affinity side I think
that it should still be feasible since cpu nodes would become containers
of threads, and cluster nodes containers (or pointed at by) of cpu nodes, but
it is true that the description won't be uniform anymore.

I prefer our solution :-)

I am not sure either, that's why I would like to hear other opinions as well.

I agree with you, the SMT thread specification in the ePAPR would become
a bit confusing though for ARM, we must make sure that what we are doing
and the ePAPR spec evolve in concert otherwise this will become unmanageable
in the long run.

We do not need phandles (pointers to cpu nodes) to describe the topology,
I guess, is the only answer.
Backward compatibility is still my main worry as far as the ePAPR is
concerned, so I am still looking forward to getting feedback from powerPC
and DT people on our proposal.

Thanks a lot,
