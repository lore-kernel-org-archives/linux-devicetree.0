It's not that simple because we have two cases in-which
send_data() will fail:
1. It run-out of IDs in requests_ida
2. There is no room in BD queue of FlexRM ring. This because each
brcm_message can be translated into variable number of descriptors.
In fact, using SPU2 crypto client we have one brcm_message translating
into 100's of descriptors. All-in-all few messages (< 1024) can also
fill-up the BD queue of FlexRM ring.

If you are referring to "txdone_ack" then this cannot be used here
because for "txdone_ack" we have to call mbox_chan_txdon() API
after writing descriptors in send_data() callback which will cause
dead-lock in tx_tick() called by mbox_chan_txdone().

I think we need to improve mailbox.c so that
mbox_chan_txdone() can be called from
send_data() callback.
