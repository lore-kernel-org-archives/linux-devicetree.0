Case-a) 'size' is a member of the payload structure itself
    The extra 'size' argument would only be used for sanity check.
    This driver seems so. Lee, can you not do without 'dsize'?

Case-b) 'size' is not a member of payload structure:
     b1)  payload is fixed length, that is 'size' := sizeof(struct my_payload)
            Here the size argument is redundant.

     b2)  payload length varies
            This case is highly unlikely because there would be no way
for remote to know how many bytes to read as the payload. Not to mean
we can't do without the 'size' argument.

Your opinion has huge weight, but I would like to be enlightened
before agreeing.

For example, I am reading this again and again without getting it.

Thanks
