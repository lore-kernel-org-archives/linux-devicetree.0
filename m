Drivers these days are often taking this value from the DT node
property 'chip-delay'. I think this would be nice to have in common
code too...

tPROG/tBERS have that special mode where R/B remains asserted but you
can still issue a status read to the chip to check on the command, so
the timeout required here is just a big number to detect failed NAND
controllers, it isn't really too important to have an exact value..

Explicitly defering to the ONFI spec makes it clear what the
definition of the timing parameter actually is.

If JEDEC has a different model then drivers will need to configure
their interfaces a little differently.

So we might end up with a jedec_sdr_timings too :|

I'd focus on getting the bus timings working before tackling too much
more ...
