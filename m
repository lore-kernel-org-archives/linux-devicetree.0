This device tree will break kernels that do not have the clk patches
applied (no clocksource, as we don't know the speed of the APB clock.
You can boot if you pass a lpj value on the command line, but won't
have a uart).

Older device trees running with the newer kernel will function as well
as pre-4.16 kernels. That is, that some IP blocks (i2c, pwm/tach, adc)
will not work as the kernel lacks reset controller and clock enabling.

Thanks for calling it out. I will modify the commit message to say
that this device tree change depends on the newer driver, and it will
not boot with kernels that lack the driver.

The g4-scu string made it into the tree before we had decided that we
would settle on aspeed,astX000-<ip> as the format for the strings. We
list both in the docs, but I would like to deprecate the old one.

If I was doing this again, I would make sure we had the clock driver
upstream before completing the other driver. It's caused a lot of
pain. Thanks for your help getting us there.

Cheers,

Joel
