That was exactly my understanding as well, and that's where I was 
expecting some trickery to happen.

The other approach I was foreseeing was to implement a way of 
dynamically updating the DT when the PCI subsystem enumerates the 
devices and assigns memory areas (namely, I would expect the ranges 
property to reflect that). But this would imply a standard way of 
defining the ranges property (I would expect something like <bar# 
start_addr length>, with an arguable number of cells). And I could
not find any such definition in the PCI bus binding document, so I'm 
probably completely off-track here. Aren't I?

After all, we should expect a driver to behave (and expect) the same of 
the DT, regardless of whether enumeration was performed by firmware or
by the OS itself. Or am I wrong on this too?

Thanks guys!
