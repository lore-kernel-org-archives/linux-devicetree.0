That would depend on how they try to boot secondary CPUs. It's
unfortunate that a product is shipping with an arbitrary implementation
specific SMP bringup mechanism, but its existence doesn't necessitate
that we support it.

People are currently working on PSCI support for 32-bit Tegra platforms
in U-Boot, and it's my understanding that a reasonable proportion of
that could should be possible to reuse for 64-bit. That may be
applicable to the Nexus 9.

Otherwise it's possible to have a shim which can place the secondaries
into a spin-table. It looks like that would be necessary anyway; there
seem to be some egregious boot protocol violations.=20

Commit e790f1deb26a2e23 ("arm64: psci: add support for PSCI invocations
from the kernel") has been upstream since v3.9-rc1. It's even in the
(v3.10 derived) tree you link to:

https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/tegra/+/android-tegra-flounder-=
3.10-lollipop-release/arch/arm64/kernel/psci.c

As is spin-table:

Supporting hardware platforms doesn't mean that we must accept code
which we believe to be problematic.

We don't want implementation-specific SMP bringup mechanisms because
we've learnt from the lessons of the past. They're almost always
ill-defined, not reusable, and they're a maintenance burden for all
system software targeting ARM which gets worse over time.

If there are technical problems with the existing mechanisms, we're ope=
n
to solving them. Others have engaged with the kernel community and/or
ARM (in the case of PSCI) to do so, and all others upstream so far have
used common enable methods.
