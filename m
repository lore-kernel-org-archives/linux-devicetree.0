Indeed, this would clean-up the driver a bit. However, the driver needs=0A=
to know how many of the devices probed successfully - to print the=0A=
number and more importantly to exit in case total_jobrs =3D 0.=0A=
=0A=
Thus, I would keep the one-by-one probing of the devices.=0A=
What options are there in this case?=0A=
Should a function symmetric to of_platform_device_create() be added - to=0A=
replace of_device_unregister() - or rely on an open-coded solution?=0A=
