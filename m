If we want to be consistent then we need to have a framework that 
handles both the SOC clock sources and the codec internal clock tree 
(including dividers and switches)
I wonder if what you are hinting at is the codec driver modeling its 
internal PLL/clock tree with the clock API?
If we have the clock API requesting the mclk only, and the rest of the 
codec configuration is done by the machine driver there is no real 
progress I can see.

I don't get the last part, how would the codec use information it 
doesn't own or have access to?
At any rate, I am only trying to define the problem statement, probably 
something to talk about at the Audio Miniconference.
