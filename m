Hold on Jean-Christophe, I made a little experiment this morning, and
this patch is not applying correctly on:
- linus' tree
- linux-next
- neither Mark's for-next branch

So, *I* will manage this patch and try to make sure that Mark is able to
seamlessly include it in his tree on top of a known source for a future
ASoC "fixes" pull-request.

Mark, what about rebasing this one on top of current Linus' tree
(toguether with the one that you have just applied on the topic/atmel
branch: (ASoC: atmel-ssc: change disable to disable in dts node)?

I hope that once reworked, they will be able to reach Linus' tree soon
because the lack of this patch is causing DTB compilation errors on all
AT91...
