I think it is actually correct. The example is confusing on what the
numbers are. IIUC, it is:

(after normalizing)

dhrystone result on big CPU is 1024 at 1100MHz
dhrystone result on little CPU is 446 at 850MHz

We have to scale the result of the little for 1100MHz in order to compare.

1100/850 = 1.294

dhrystone result on little CPU is 446 * 1.294 = 577 at 1100MHz

So we put the normalized values 1024 and 577. The arch_topology will
scale 577 back to 446 as it will compute the max capacity based on the
max freq which is 850MHz.

The *final* capacities are 1024 for cluster0 and 446 for cluster1 (read
the cpu max capacity, the ones showed in the sysfs).

Did I miss something ?
