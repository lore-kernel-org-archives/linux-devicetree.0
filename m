OK. Good to know that we are speaking the same language.

Sure thing. I'm trying to locate where the right place would be.
I'll target commit message and source code for now.

The guest machine owns the channel HW which runs independent of the management HW.

The HIDMA "management" driver which runs at the hypervisor owns the management HW. 
Management driver serves two purposes.

1. Common bus parameter configuration (could be called reset driver).
2. Fine tuning the HW resources.

Multiple HIDMA channels share common HW resources. The management driver is able to change 
the priority (high/low) and weight (round-robin priority) of each HIDMA channel on the flight. 

The system administrator will use a userspace application to allocate HW resources to each channel via
the management driver.

The management driver does some common configuration too for these parameters. 
The management interface also has to be enabled before any channel can be enabled.

- max-write-burst-bytes: Maximum write burst in bytes that HIDMA can 
  occupy the bus for in a single transaction. A memcpy requested is 
  fragmented to multiples of this amount. This parameter is used while
  writing into destination memory. Setting this value incorrectly can
  starve other peripherals in the system.
- max-read-burst-bytes: Maximum read burst in bytes that HIDMA can
  occupy the bus for in a single transaction. A memcpy request is
  fragmented to multiples of this amount. This parameter is used while
  reading the source memory. Setting this value incorrectly can starve
  other peripherals in the system.
- max-write-transactions: This value is how many times a write burst is 
  applied back to back while writing to the destination before yielding 
  the bus.
- max-read-transactions: This value is how many times a read burst is
  applied back to back while reading the source before a yielding the bus.
- channel-reset-timeout-cycles: Channel reset timeout in cycles for this SOC.
  Once a reset is applied to the HW, HW starts a timer for reset operation
  to confirm. If reset is not completed within this time, HW reports reset
  failure.

Would you use host/guest relationship?

I need the management driver for administrative purposes and common initialization. 
I like the split SW design as it follows the HW design too.
