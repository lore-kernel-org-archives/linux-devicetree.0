I was trying to stick to the sysreg C accessors, and thought there would be more
registers that needed copying. (I discovered this VHE doesn't remap all the _ELx
registers quite late.)

Yes, that looks much better. I got tangled up in 'which alternative', but you're
right, they are all applied in one go so it doesn't matter.

I don't think this READ_ONCE() is needed, that only matters within the
stop_machine()/alternatives-patching code that modifies the value on one CPU.


Thanks,
