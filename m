No, you're not missing anything. What I want is for clock provider
drivers to actually be real Linux device drivers. Right now the drivers
that only call CLK_OF_DECLARE are essentially just initcall hacks, and
this causes problems down the road when you decide you want your clk
provider driver to have suspend/resume ops, etc. Also I feel that having
proper drivers will be important as runtime pm and the generic power
domains stuff matures.

On ARMv8, mandatory use of architected timers removes the need for the
clk framework to be involved with timer init, so it's definitely not
true for all platforms.

On QCOM's 32-bit platforms they have an always-on clock with a known
fixed rate, so they can either put the fixed-rate clock in DT, or even
just put the frequency as a property into the timer node with no need to
involve the clk framework (which is what they do today). That is also a
bit hacky, but it is why you won't find CLK_OF_DECLARE in
drivers/clk/qcom and all of their drivers are proper platform_drivers.

Right, if your 32k clock is a fixed-clock, and if it is provided on the
board (e.g. external extal -> lpc timer) then you could just put the
fixed-rate clock into DT (which uses CLK_OF_DECLARE) and reference that
from your timer node. The rest of the clocks could be registered later
through a platform_driver.

Sounds like your timer clocking scheme is more complicated than that
however.

I was just discussing this with Stephen and we're both curious to know
if the same "nxp,lpc1850-creg-clk" compatible string can be used with
CLK_OF_DECLARE for registering the bare minimum early clks, and also
with a platform_driver using a different table of clocks for late
registration.

The compat string could be the same, and the driver would have different
tables/setup functions to keep from re-registering the same clocks
twice.

I know that nobody likes to be the guinea pig for this type of stuff,
but the lack of participation in the Linux driver model for clk drivers
needs to curbed. Do you think the above proposed scheme could work for
your clock provider drivers?
