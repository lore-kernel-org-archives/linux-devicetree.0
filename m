I didn't think hard enough about this earlier, but there are really only
two hardware interfaces on TVP5150. The ADC input, which can be
connected to either of two composite input pins (AIP1A, AIP1B), or use
both for s-video, and the digital output connected to pins (YOUT[7:0]).

VBI data can be transferred via the output pins during horizontal or
vertical blanking, if I understand correctly, or read from a FIFO via
I2C.

There is no apparent support for audio data whatsoever, and the only
mention of audio in the data manual is a vague reference about an "audio
interface available on the TVP5150" providing a clock to an audio
interface between an external audio decoder and the backend processor.

Further, commit 55606310e77f ("[media] tvp5150: create the expected
number of pads") creates DEMOD_NUM_PADS pads, but doesn't mention or
initialize the audio pad. It clearly expects the value of DEMOD_NUM_PADS
to be 3. And indeed the fourth pad was added later in commit
bddc418787cc ("[media] au0828: use standard demod pads struct").

So to me it looks like the VBI and audio pads should be removed from
TVP5150.

In this case, removal of the VBI and audio pads might make this work,
but in general this is true. In my opinion, to make this truly generic,
we need an interface to ask the driver which media entity pad a given
device tree port corresponds to, as there might not even be a single
media entity corresponding to all ports for more complex devices.

I don't think enforcing a 1:1 correspondence between device tree node
and media entity and enforcing port reg property == entity pad index is
a good idea in the long run. Binding errors are going to be made that
will have to be worked around at the driver level, and more complex
devices might have to create multiple media entities / v4l2 subdevices
with external ports that interface with the of graph.

I think the output part is accurate, as the audio pad is an artifact of
an unrelated change. I'm not so sure about the VBI pad, but I think that
shouldn't exist either. The input pad, on the other hand, not having any
of graph representation in the device tree seems a bit strange. There
was a custom binding for the inputs, that got quickly reverted:
