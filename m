Ok, I have now figured out why this was as it were, and I no longer agree
with adding the extra properties. The whole of example 2 is inside a
reference (using the &hlcdc notation) to the hlcdc node in example 1, and
therefore these "missing" properties are not missing. I think they are
just clutter that hides what is really needed/different between example 1
and 2, and apparently Boris and Rob agreed when they acked/reviewed. The
description of example 2 also clearly states that example 2 is changes
and additions on top of example 1. So, I plan to have this in the next
iteration:

	&hlcdc {
		hlcdc-display-controller {
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_lcd_base &pinctrl_lcd_rgb565>;

			port@0 {
				hlcdc_panel_output: endpoint@0 {
					bus-width = <16>;
				};
			};
		};
	};

Jacopo, please let me know if you want me to keep your review tag anyway...
