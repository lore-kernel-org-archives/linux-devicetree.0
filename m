Yes. You can have a local interrupt that goes directly to a specific
core, not via the PLIC.

It's in the RISC-V privileged specification. Therefore, if a riscv
core can run linux it will have these CSRs.

No. SiFive implementations always have a PLIC, though.

They are coupled if they both exist. The privileged specification does
explicitly call out interrupts 9 and 11 in the HLIC for attaching the
PLIC.

@palmer: Can you add this?

What flags?

HLIC = level. PLIC = both.

Sure. I thought it would be nice to include a complete cpu example
somewhere, though.

Both. The HLIC is entirely manager through CSRs. The PLIC is managed
through a memory mapped interface. The PLIC is attached to the HLIC.

Still unsure what flags we're talking about.

You're in principle correct, although these are probably always the same.

Uhm. I suppose we can change this. However, it would requires changes
to quite a number of riscv repositories. I believe this is also
included in the riscv platform specification. A better description is
easy, do we really need to change the key?

Yes.

Yes. Order and position matter.

9 and 11 are in the privileged specification.

We already deal with this. If the interrupt is '-1', we skip it.
That's done in plic.c:
                if (parent.args[0] == -1) continue; // skip context holes

The device-tree-specification seems to indicate that this is mandatory
for an interrupt-controller. Or have I understood this wrongly? When
you use interrupts-extended, doesn't it use the address-cells of the
interrupt controller? We should add that size-cells = 0, though.
