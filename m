Hi Andre,

As a nit, please post bindings before drivers, as per
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/submitting-patches.txt.

Is this following some standard, or is this something that you have
invented? If the latter, why are we inventing a new standard? |How does
this relate to SCPI and/or SCMI? 

What exactly is "the generic ARM SMC mailbox"?

Bindings do not document drivers. As Rob said, s/Driver/Interface/.

What does each function do? I guess it signal that FW should look at a
particular mailbox, but the binding doesn't actually say.

If this is following the SMCCC, what is the function prototype?

What arguments are taken, and what return values are required under
which conditions?

Are they fast calls, or are they pre-emptible? When does the FW return?

If we're inventing a standard, why have multiple function IDs rather
than passing a channel ID in as a paarameter?

This needs a more rigorous definition.

Make this property mandatory, don't guess. Please follow the wording
used by ther PSCI binding.

Given one can use HVC, the "arm,smc-func-ids" property is misleading,
and would be better as something like "func-ids".

Thanks,
Mark.
