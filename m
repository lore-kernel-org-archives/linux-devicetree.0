In the process of porting some boards to DT, I noticed the simple-card
driver is already capable of handling most cases just fine. The missing
bits I've spotted are:

 * The clock that is passed in is only read, never set, which is not
   sufficient for boards that support several sampling rates with
   different base frequencies

 * The sysclk id that is passed to snd_soc_dai_set_sysclk() is
   hard-coded

 * There's currently no support for calling into snd_soc_dai_set_clkdiv()

The following three patches fix all those and make simple-card a good
match for the board I'm working with.


Thanks,
Daniel
