I made the trivial changes I mentioned, added a dependency on
CONFIG_BROKEN (for the config/MMIO muxing issue), and put these on
pci/host-tango.  I can't build or test this, so I probably broke
something in the process.  I think the combination of the boot-time
warning, the taint, and CONFIG_BROKEN is a reasonable amount of
warning that a user should expect issues.

Can you take a look and see if it works for you?
