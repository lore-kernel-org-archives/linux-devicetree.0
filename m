This patch adds devicetree binding for System Control and Management
Interface (SCMI) Message Protocol used between the Application Cores(AP)
and the System Control Processor(SCP). The MHU peripheral provides a
mechanism for inter-processor communication between SCP's M3 processor
and AP.

SCP offers control and management of the core/cluster power states,
various power domain DVFS including the core/cluster, certain system
clocks configuration, thermal sensors and many others.

SCMI protocol is developed as better replacement to the existing SCPI
which is not flexible and easily extensible.

+System Control and Management Interface (SCMI) Message Protocol
+----------------------------------------------------------
+
+The SCMI is intended to allow agents such as OSPM to manage various functions
+that are provided by the hardware platform it is running on, including power
+and performance functions.
+
+This binding is intended to define the interface the firmware implementing
+the SCMI as described in ARM document number ARM DUI 0922B ("ARM System Control
+and Management Interface Platform Design Document")[0] provide for OSPM in
+the device tree.
+
+Required properties:
+
+The scmi node with the following properties shall be under the /firmware/ node.
+
+- compatible : shall be "arm,scmi"
+- mboxes: List of phandle and mailbox channel specifiers. It should contain
+	  exactly one or two mailboxes, one for transmitting messages("tx")
+	  and another optional for receiving the notifications("rx") if
+	  supported.
+- mbox-names: shall be "tx" or "rx"
+- shmem : List of phandle pointing to the shared memory(SHM) area as per
+	  generic mailbox client binding.
+
+See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/mailbox.txt for more details
+about the generic mailbox controller and client driver bindings.
+
+The mailbox is the only permitted method of calling the SCMI firmware.
+Mailbox doorbell is used as a mechanism to alert the presence of a
+messages and/or notification.
+
+Each protocol supported shall have a sub-node with corresponding compatible
+as described in the following sections. If the platform supports dedicated
+communication channel for a particular protocol, the 3 properties namely:
+mboxes, mbox-names and shmem shall be present in the sub-node corresponding
+to that protocol.
+
+Clock/Performance bindings for the clocks/OPPs based on SCMI Message Protocol
+------------------------------------------------------------
+
+This binding uses the common clock binding[1].
+
+Required properties:
+- #clock-cells : Should be 1. Contains the Clock ID value used by SCMI commands.
+
+Power domain bindings for the power domains based on SCMI Message Protocol
+------------------------------------------------------------
+
+This binding for the SCMI power domain providers uses the generic power
+domain binding[2].
+
+Required properties:
+ - #power-domain-cells : Should be 1. Contains the device or the power
+			 domain ID value used by SCMI commands.
+
+Sensor bindings for the sensors based on SCMI Message Protocol
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+SCMI provides an API to access the various sensors on the SoC.
+
+Required properties:
+- #thermal-sensor-cells: should be set to 1. This property follows the
+			 thermal device tree bindings[3].
+
+			 Valid cell values are raw identifiers (Sensor ID)
+			 as used by the firmware. Refer to  platform details
+			 for your implementation for the IDs to use.
+
+SRAM and Shared Memory for SCMI
+-------------------------------
+
+A small area of SRAM is reserved for SCMI communication between application
+processors and SCP.
+
+The properties should follow the generic mmio-sram description found in [4]
+
+Each sub-node represents the reserved area for SCMI.
+
+Required sub-node properties:
+- reg : The base offset and size of the reserved area with the SRAM
+- compatible : should be "arm,scmi-shmem" for Non-secure SRAM based
+	       shared memory
