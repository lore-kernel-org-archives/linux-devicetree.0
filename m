I think the problem is how the gpio controller has a device node
that overlaps with one of the devices of the chip.

If the data sheet lists a "Clock and Reset Unit" at those addresses,
that is a strong indication that this is actually a specific
piece of hardware, and it should be represented as one device node
in DT, with the sub-registers being exposed by that driver in
some way. A typical way would be to have a syscon node like

	cru: syscon@1800c100 {
		compatible = "brcm,bcm53010-clock-reset-unit", "syscon";
		reg = <0x1800c100 100>;
	};

that represents the entire unit. You can then have syscon references
in each driver that uses it, and/or create a high-level driver that
binds to the "brcm,bcm53010-clock-reset-unit" compatible string and that
exports a set of functions for other drivers to be used if you prefer
to do this as functional abstraction rather than register based.

If it's only "very similar" but not identical, don't use the same compatible
string, at least not as the only one. You should be able to identify the
specific device by looking at its compatible string in case you want to
write a high-level driver that knows about the differences later (the driver
should not need to inquire the chip name, it should only look at one device
node).
