Just for disambiguation, I guess you are referring to the Xen code in
Linux (such as arch/arm/xen/enlighten.c), right?

We have "Xen", the hypervisor, which runs before Linux and it is a
separate component running at EL2, and we have Xen support in Linux,
such as arch/arm/xen and drivers/xen. These are drivers to communicate
with the Xen hypervisor and other components in a Xen system.

In this case, the Xen hypervisor would be the owner of the clock. Xen
support in Linux, specifically arch/arm/xen/enlighten.c, only comes into
the picture to "warn" Linux that shouldn't really be messing with the
clocks. I guess that from a Linux clock driver point of view, it is a
consumer.

I hope that helps.
