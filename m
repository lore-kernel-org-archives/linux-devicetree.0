When kernel is working, kernel will create its own page table based on
UEFI memory map. Since it's reserved in DTS file as Leo's patch, it'll
be moved to reserved memblock. Why is it wrong?

In the second, UEFI is firmware. When it's stable, nobody should change
it without any reason. These reserved memory are used in mailbox driver.
Look. It's driver, so it could be changed at any time. Why do you want
to UEFI knowing this memory range? Do you hope UEFI to change when
mailbox driver is changed?

As I said above, kernel will create its own page table. When kernel's
page table is working, UEFI's page table is destroying. So the memory
won't be mapped twice at the same time. What's wrong?

1. Are we talking on the same thing? Leo already mentioned that all
memory node in DTB will be destroyed by kernel when EFI_STUB is enabled
on arm. Did you read the source code after his reply?
And you suggested that Leo to use discrete memory region in DTB. It is
really wrong. Kernel only gets memory map information from UEFI, not
DTB.

2. The working flow is in below.
   a. Kernel gets memory map information from UEFI.
   b. Kernel loads the memory reserved information from DTB.

3. Do you mean the reserved-memory is totally wrong? If it's wrong,
please submit patches to remove all reserved-memory in linux kernel
first.

4. Again and again. Memory node should be only used to describe the
RAM information.
