I would say aspeed as it is tied to their chip.

But you do already have <soc> in the compatible, but in a slightly
different form and position. And "cf" is the block.

So I'd propose: aspeed,ast2500-cf-fsi-master

Okay.

memory-region is a standard property. sram and cvic are not, so should
have vendor prefixes. However, perhaps we should add a common "sram"
property to sram/sram.txt.
