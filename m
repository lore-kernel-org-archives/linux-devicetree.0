Thanks for your efforts. It is good to see that you are caring for
both r8a7790 and r8a7791 now.

By the way, have you decided how to use DT with the PHY driver? Just
integrating this portion seems of the hardware seems insufficient to
me.

I believe the PHY driver is also needed in the system for correct
runtime configuration of USB0 and USB2. So DT support is needed for
multiple drivers for correct operation in the DT case. Regardless it
is of course good to see DT support for this hardware block but it
would be useful to have a good overview of DT support for all
components involved in USB Host support to avoid committing to a
premature half-baked ABI.
