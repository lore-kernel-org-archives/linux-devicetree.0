I'm still not sure why the list is necessary.  You have a separate
thread of execution for each writer, why not just time it in that
thread?

What about the following, not even compile-tested, patch?  I'm
sure my mailer will munge this up, I can send you a clean version
if you like.

Subject: [PATCH] ipmi:bt-bmc: Fix a multi-user race, time out responses

The IPMI spec says to time out responses after a given amount of
time, so don't let a writer send something after an amount of time
has elapsed.

Also, fix a race condition in the same area where if you have two
writers at the same time, one can get a EIO return when it should
still be waiting its turn to send.  A mutex_lock_interruptible_timeout()
would be handy here, but it doesn't exist.

Yeah, as usual, the IPMI spec is kind of vague about this.  You have
to think about the problem from the host driver's point of view to
know what this means.

 From a host driver point of view, it's going to send a request and wait
for a response with the same sequence number.  It should time out the
request in "BMC Request-to-Response time" seconds.  After that point,
it's free to re-use the sequence number.  So what a BMC cannot do is
send that response after the timeout.

If the timeout is 5 seconds, and the BMC gets a flash write request that
takes 3 seconds then sits waiting for 2 seconds, it should not send the
response because the host driver may mistake it for a request it just
sent.  So the timeout should be based on when the BMC got the request,
not when the response was queued for write, and that's the reason that
the BMC timer should be somewhat shorter than the host timer, as it
says.

I don't see an easy way to do this.  Some possibilities I can think of are:

  * Switch to using an ioctl to do the read/write operation. That's
    kind of ugly.  It's what the IPMI driver interface does, and it
    has been somewhat of a pain.
  * You could define a "header" that is put into the read message
    and write message.  You could add an ioctl to query the header
    size; if the ioctl fails then the driver doesn't have a header.
    Add a jiffie to the header of the read message that the
    BMC userland must put into the header of the write message.
    You could even have the ioctl enable the header, to preserve
    backwards compatibility.
  * Define some sort of structure that you read/write.  This has all
    sorts of issues.

I think my preference is the second, it allows for backwards
compatibility and lets the kernel do basically whatever it wants with
the data.
