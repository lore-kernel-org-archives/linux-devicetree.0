Why is it such a big deal to not have a representation for all the common 
units of measurement? They are already defined so why not add them to your 
suffix file? I would think that if you are going to make us use this 
suffix devicetree thing, you would not restrict us to use only the units 
you think are appropriate.

I wouldn't think you would restrict us to saying it is a 5700ml Hemi V8 
would you?
