I just double checked with ST and STiH412 is a STiH407 family based SoC
so support still exists for this upstream. No idea what if any security is
enabled on this product though.

Most probably the A/V stack on it will be SDK2, although native upstream
multimedia drivers for this chipset are looking pretty good now.
