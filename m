The patches in Russell's tree do not break anything, I asked him to drop
them since, if we change the bindings again, those patches change and have
to be reworked. It was not meant to blame you at all, just saying that
the process to get this stuff in the kernel should be defined properly
and patches reviewed in a timely fashion.

And for legacy reasons the situation related to cpu/cpus node bindings
is a complicated one, there are bindings in the ePAPR, bindings in the
kernel, people are confused and with this set we wanted to draw a
line. For arm64 this is an absolute must.

I disagree with you on the "new kernels must not require a new DT".
That's true if bindings are well defined, not for a mix of legacy ePAPR and
bindings-in-the-kernel.

What's the DT standard for ARM cpu/cpus node ? ePAPR ? In kernel docs ?
A combination thereof ? Things are not clear cut and I do not like that, it
is confusing.

Good, that's all I wanted to know, thanks.

I will give it more thought, point taken.

"spin-table" is how the current v8 kernel boots, I am not adding
anything. It is documented in Documentation/arm64/booting.txt.
I have to add the possible wake-up method(s) to the definition of
spin-table here.

Just adding PSCI is tempting but not viable, that would make people
think that's the only allowed method and that's not acceptable.

While defining the process for the introduction of new DT bindings
please consider how we have to deal with legacy bindings designed for
PowerPC that people tend to reuse for ARM ("status" property in cpu
nodes is next, as James highlighted in another thread).

We are doing that in a case by case fashion and that's becoming a nightmare.

Thank you !
