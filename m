Okay.  So before I code this up we should agree on syntax.

How would you like to represent the break between signal and message?
Obviously ' ' would be a bad idea, as some clients may want to send
messages with white space contained.  How about '\t' or '\n'?

Okay, I see.  Thanks for the clarification.

This conversation doesn't really belong in this thread; but seeing as
you bought it up ...

I absolutely and fundamentally disagree that the controller shouldn't
do error checking during mbox_request_channel(). It is
mbox_request_channel() that should fail on a known bad configuration,
rather than pass back a known rotten apple and wait for that it to be
eaten (appreciate I've gone a little overboard with the analogies)
before flagging it up.  And for what purpose?  To make the controller
driver a little simpler?  I do hope that you do see sense on this one
and allow me to keep the error checking in the driver!

If you have a reply to this, please do so one the driver thread, so
it's easier to follow.

Secondly, a reply more akin to this thread.  The guys using _this_
driver are more likely to be Controller authors.  These are the chaps
I was speaking about that are going to know the platform specifics of
the controller.  The error checking in mbox_request_channel() is
designed for 'client' authors, who are more likely to be requesting
invalid configurations.
