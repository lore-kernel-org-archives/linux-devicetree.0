Yeah, I'd be happy too, that would simplify also my life.

Actually I was thinking of 2 defconfigs :
 - one for platform_data based boards pxa2xx
 - one for DT only boards pxa2xx

Most probably AFAIK.

If you put MMC_PXA, one can argue why not any MTD device used on pxa devices,
such as pxa2xx-flash or docg3/docg4, etc ... I won't argue, I'm just pondering
about the right choice.

I'm very eager to see a patch on that. I can feed my Jenkins with it, it would
greatly help me catch issues earlier. Moreover it would for free test it on
lubbock, mainstone and mioa701. If there was one also for pxa3xx, I would launch
it on zylonite cm-x300 ... (that's a bonus, I know :))

Cheers.
