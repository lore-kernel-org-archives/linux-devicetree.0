Yes, they are independent, but sharing the same top level status interrupt.
There's no SOC-wide PMU which aggregates these counters.

Beside the ARMv8 core PMU which has the compatible name "arm,armv8-pmuv3",
these are all the PMUs in X-Gene SoCs. Also, we are using the same PMU
driver across our platforms. I think a general name is what it should be.

The index property is used for indicating the physical hardware PMU id.
For example, on X-Gene1 there are 4 memory controllers (MC), each of them has
its own PMU. The index property tells us which MC a PMU belongs to.
The same for MCB/L3C and IOB.
