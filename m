It has been quiet a while since I read LDD3, but, I remember this information
being somewhere in it or may be I am wrong. Not aware if these are related to
the P and V concept for semaphores.

Hmm.. You surprised me, I was not aware of put_user etc. myself. Never seen
them anywhere. I have only used and seen copy_(to/from)_user or may be it's
just that I have not worked, where these are used. I guess these _put_user family
of functions, do not carry out any kind of verification.

Yes, you are right. The platform_device_put has got to with the reference count.
platform_device_put in turn calls put_device and which in turn calls kobject_put.
The reference count for the kobject is decremented. When the reference count
reaches 0 for the kobject, kobject_cleanup is called to free the resources.

You will find good explanation of all this, the Chapter 14 Linux Device Model  of
LDD3. That is one of the best chapters to read in that book.
