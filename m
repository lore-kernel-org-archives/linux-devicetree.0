It is multi-function in the sense that multiple subsystems needing to
access shared registers. If you have ECC, then you would need to give
EDAC subsystem access to ECC related registers.

Exactly. The same is true of the dts. It makes little sense to describe
only 1 register of a h/w block. Perhaps the memory controller subsystem
(drivers/memory) can be expanded to include self-refresh functions.
Entering self-refresh can be tricky, so it might not really be possible
to define a common api here.
