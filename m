I have done a version with a crypto_queue and a kthread.
This works perfectly but.. the performance are really really bad.
Never more than 20k request/s when both generic and synchronous SS can go b=
eyond 80k.
With this asynchronous driver, the Security System become useful only with =
request larger than 2048 bytes
I have patched my driver to create stats on request size, this show that re=
al usage is less than that. (512bytes for cryptoluks for example)

Furthermore, my current patch for using the PRNG cannot be used with the kt=
hread since it use the hwrng interface.
But perhaps by using also a crypto_rng alg it could be done.

So I think that if I want to make the SS driver useful, I cannot set it asy=
nchronous.
Perhaps when the DMA engine will be available, this will change.

I have attached the patch that make my driver asynchronous for comments on =
possible improvement.

Thanks I use spin_lock_bh now.

Thanks, now I use atomic function everywhere it need to.

Yes I fixed it by not using _relaxed.

I have rework the cipher functions and now they handle all possibility.
With that DES/3DES is now fully supported without fallback.
