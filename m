I understand, but the question still is: how to
present the information in a valid way.

To use gpio propperly it would require that the driver
implements a “sub-driver” pinctrl with all the extra
(boilerplate) code overhead.

Also this would mean mixing different types of
logical drivers into a single source - I doubt that
would be easy to get accepted...

Here again a summary of all the GPIOs that the mcp2517fd has:
* TXCAN: dedicated GPIO with single function, 
         individually conigurable as push/pull or open drain
* INT: main interrupt line - configurable as push/pull or 
         individually conigurable as push/pull or open drain
* GPIO0: general GPIO with in/out option, but 2 special “cases”:
         tx-irq and TX-disable
         group configurable as push/pull or open drain
* GPIO1: general GPIO with in/out potion, but 1 special “cases”:
         rx-irq
         group configurable as push/pull or open drain
* CLKO/SOF: clock output at (1/10th, 1/5th, 1/2, 1 of the 
            core frequency) or start of frame output
            possibly group configurable as push/pull or open drain
	    (not explicitly specified in datasheet)

How would you try to present that HW-configuration in the 
device tree instead?
How would it impact the driver design?

Thanks,
	Martin
