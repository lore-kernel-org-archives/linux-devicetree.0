Hi Bjorn,

Thanks for the patches, I tested few regulators which are connected to 
IO devices with this series on IFC6410 with APQ8064 and they work fine. 
Except one issue which you already are aware of "regulator dependencies 
on each other" I guess this is another topic which can be discussed 
separately to this patchset.
