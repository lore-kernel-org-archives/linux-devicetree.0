You don't have to call drm_irq_install(). Both the exynos and i.MX
driver do without it and at least the i.MX driver uses multiple irqs per
drm_device.

A super node approach doesn't mean that there's only one platform
device. You can still have a platform device for each component. The
super node should rather be seen as a node which contains phandles
to the different components..
