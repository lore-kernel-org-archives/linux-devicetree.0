Well, I plan to add no code at all to mach-berlin except machine init.
If there would be some mach-multiv7, I'd be happy to put it in there.

mach-mvebu is still a moving target and adding it there would cause more
trouble than it helps. Adding the other Orion SoCs will be enough for
now.

About the dts/dtsi naming, I really have no preference. I had
soc-vendor-boardname style before v4. About the new naming, I liked
that SoC dtsi are named after soc-vendor,soc-type.dtsi while boards are
named after board-vendor,board-name.dts. It kind of matches what you
will look for if you have e.g. the Google Chromecast and not know about
the Soc used.

We still have some time before the ARM merge window for 3.14 closes,
right? So I can have another round of code moving and renaming within
this patch set ;)
