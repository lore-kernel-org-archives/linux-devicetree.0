AFAIKS, the patch in question has been applied by Olof for the next
cycle and after 4.2-rc2. You just name the patch, while Olof and I
will have to work it out:

@Olof: Any specific branch you want me to base a potential PR for
the initial Berlin4CT patches on? If you prefer to pick up the
two patches directly, feel free to add my

You can rebase on anything that is considered stable, i.e. my
berlin/foo-for-4.x-n branches become stable as soon as I send out a PR
to arm-soc. Before stable I can reorder/squash/fixup any patches
in there (or anything that will change the commit hash). Once I
declare it stable and anything needs to be changed, I'll have to
apply proper patches or even apply revert patches.

Not directly, arm-soc by itself has no stable branches I know of. But
there may be stable topic branches that can be referred to but that
will be worked out on single topics by arm-soc/subsystem maintainers
and patch authors. Likely cross-subsystem patch sets or large patch
sets will end up in topic branches.
