No worries. I've been at Linaro connect this last week anyway.

You want a v3 with it added?

Indeed. I can definitely understand why the *models* might want
to be bundled with DTs (or a DT generator, or a
--just-give-me-a-working-dt-for-my-command-line-options-option).

I'm sure you mean other peoples opinions ;-) (especially so, since after 
reading things back, I realized I expressed mine rather more forefully 
than intended) but I think there is a reason why PSCI is special... 
basically its to do with the docs.

I figured out how to use foundation model by reading the documentation. 
That documentation says "to run Linux go read the Linaro stuff". As it 
happens the Linaro "stuff" loops you through to a different ARM doc 
which tells you how to download ARM TF and bootloader binaries from 
Linaro. Thus if you follow the docs (and are patient enough) you come 
out the other side with a model running ARM TF and ready for PSCI.

At that point you're ready for mainline kernel development... and you 
wonder why there is only one CPU running ;-).
