Not much of a reason, but I thought configurability is a positive.
There's really not a good reason to not have this driver though; I can't
imagine someone wanting to build our platform but not be able to reboot
it.

I didn't know that. A default is technically different than "should a
user be able to disable this," but I suppose the policy makes sense.

I see. That's why I immediately ruled it out.

OK, that's OK with me if it's OK with Sebastian, et al. Respin coming
soon, separate from the mach-bcm and ARM stuff...

(BTW, we might consider rewriting the other config entries to be
similar, if we really want to make this things consistently
nitpick-proof.)
