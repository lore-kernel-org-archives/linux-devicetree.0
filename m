Hi Mark,
thanks for taking time reviewing the driver. Some comments below...

Ok will double-check. Very early during my driver development I was not
able to play audio through aplay if this function was not provided. I
don't recall what specific Kernel version that was but it may have been
something like 4.1.

Got it. This was plagiarized from a similar driver but I agree this
is not a performance critical loop or something.

Good feedback, I needed some outside guidance here. Definitely will dig
into this again but I'll be on vacation for a bit starting tomorrow so I
won't get to it right away.

As explained in the code comment even with a boiled-down test code that
has an empty threaded handler the system would come to a grinding halt
when bombarded with interrupts every 300us which I found odd but not
completely unexpected (from my MCU background POV that is). And while
digging I had seen that the interrupts do get disabled just like you
mention during threaded handling to operate in a more graceful manner.
But I wasn't sure at this point if the additional (high priority, I
suppose) overhead of creating/starting the thread (even an empty one)
every 300us was just too much for my poor single-core SoC to handle so
my assumption was that it never got cycles to process stuff other than
interrupts, and disabling interrupts in the low-level handler fixed just
that. But I'm going to spend some extra cycles trying to re-digest the
realtime behavior of my particular SoC/setup to understand why exactly
this is happening.

I'm currently using these handlers to essentially tame the TAS5720 error
reporting. Only when the device is in shutdown mode it will seize
bombarding the host with 300us-spaced FAULT interrupts (that will come
as soon as the SAIF stream stops).  Unfortunately that's the way the
TAS5720 was designed and I've already provided feedback internally that
this makes an elegant / low-overhead SW implementation quite
challenging. Anyways I did see several places where this shutdown mode
handling could get added so I simply picked the one that was not directly
associated with the audio stream itself to make it more explicit what
this is about but this can certainly be changed.
