It a clock needs to be enabled during suspend, then the driver using
it should not disable it. Anyway, suspend is a bit orthogonal to this
issue.

You cannot tell here up front whether clocks are really always-on. A
reviewer is not going to know, and the submitter may not even have all
the documentation and know the answer. Getting it wrong here means you
have to change the dtb to fix it. Granted, it doesn't really break
things in this case.

It does because you have to assume either the initial state is wrong
and you need to disable it, or that the initial state is correct and
you need to leave the clock enabled.

There are also other usecases such as simplefb where you want to leave
clocks on until the real fb driver takes over. Consoles have a similar
issue.

Perhaps you need to model your buses more completely? Does
simple-pm-bus help you?

It does have something to do with DT because you are designing a
binding around what the kernel does. Should the kernel assume it can
disable clocks safely? Another OS may do the opposite and assume it
cannot turn-off unused clocks. Then you would have a list of clocks
safe to disable in DT.

This is also completely solvable within the framework driver by
claiming those clocks in the clock controller driver.
