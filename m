Per the BCM5301X Preliminary Programmer's Register Reference guide
(page 394), under the second titled "System Address Mapping".
There is a table listing the System Address Mapping.  The parts that
are of interest in this converstation are (and forgive my
approxmiation, but I cannot cut'n'paste from it):

Address Range                Size            Description
---------------------------------------------------
0x0000_0000-0x07FF_FFFF    128 MB       DDR2/3 SDRAM Memory Region*
0x8000_0000-0xBFFF_FFFF    1 G          DDR2/3 SDRAM Large Region

* The DDR2/3 SDRAM Memory Region (128MB) is a subset of the DDR2/3
SDRAM Large Region (1GB).  Additionally, 0x0000_0000-0x07FF_FFFF is
aliased to 0x8000_0000-0x87FF_FFFF

However, since you say it isn't working for you, then there must be
some other missing peice.  I'll retract my comment for now, and
hopefully we can double back and get it working in the future.

Thanks,
Jon
