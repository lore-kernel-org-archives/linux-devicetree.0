The code needs to make it clear that this is an intentional fallthrough,
an explicit default case would help a lot.

It will disable the regulators but that's not going to end well if
you're including core supplies required to maintain the register map,
it'll disable before runtime suspend and enable after runtime resume.
The regulator supply widget is intended for supplies that power
particular components on the CODEC.

That still doesn't explain the bouncing on and off here.
