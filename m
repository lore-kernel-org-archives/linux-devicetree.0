Just noticed the commit message has "helps helps" in it.

Dependants is the noun, tho that might be a British English thing (what
I had in school). I learned English as 4th/5th language together with
Latin, so beside being a mixture of American and British English some
custom English surfaces from time to time. :)

Didn't notice until you pointed it out. Thanks.

And the way he formulated it he probably already knows that more is
needed. I'll investigate it.

The card isn't really accessible and as such polling sort of pointless.
I prefer non-removable but left it as-is for V1.
