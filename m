Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: hisilicon: Add missing clocks property for CPUs

The clocks property should either be present for all the CPUs of a
cluster or none. If these are present only for a subset of CPUs of a
cluster then things will start falling apart as soon as the CPUs are
brought online in a different order. For example, this will happen
because the operating system looks for such properties in the CPU node
it is trying to bring up, so that it can register a cooling device.

Add missing clocks property.
