There are no major comments in V1.
I just addressed some of the comments given by kukjin kim(regarding
clocks) ,Sachin(regarding I2S base addresses).
As I deleted the variable which holds the names of the RCLK src clocks
in the driver in the first patch set, this breaks the older platforms.
 So I reworked on older platforms and added I2S clkdev support and
tested on s3c64xx series and deleted that variable from samsung-i2s
structure.
Added NULL in place of cdclk of sclk_audio0 src list because adding
rate of that clk is a question to me because this is machine dependent
and I am also not using this as parent clk.

In my next version of patchset I will mention the difference clearly.
