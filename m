Indeed, there could be an attribute as 'port-value'.

These values come from the TDA19988 documentation (the TDA9988 and
TDA9989 have the same video and audio input registers).
- 0x03 is WS (Word Select - bit 0) =3D 1 (I2S) and AP (Audio Pin) =3D 1=
 (bit 1)
- 0x04 is WS =3D 0 (S/PDIF) and AP =3D 2 (bit 2)

Strange. I have no error.

I don't remember from where I got the TDA19988 documentation, but,
anyway, the port values are the same as the ones found in the first
kernel provided by the Cubox manufacturer.

No, because I don't need a so complex codec. Mine has no codec device,
no private data, no clock, and it is less than 150 lines of code.
Also, as my machine is now obsolete, I will stop any development for it
and keep the kernel I have and which works fine enough for me.

Best regards.
