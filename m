Agreed. This will have to be documented in the kernel going forward. Not
buried in 4 different threads where everybody has a different opinion.

I can imagine situations where we have a trivial stable binding for the
"enterprise" users but then a feature rich experimental binding for the
same class of devices. The latter will result from all the vendors
pumping out new SoCs with previously unthought of configurations. This
does seems to allow both camps to be happy.

I like it...as long as this is coupled with a process of DT binding
review that allows the experimental bindings to evolve over time just
like kernel frameworks.

The use case I think of is a new SoC entering the kernel. At first you
get your basics going and upstream: uart, mmc, etc. No common clock
driver and no PMU driver, those may be handled in the bootloader at
first. No need to have clock and regulator support in the binding at
this point. Then you incrementally add clock support and the properties
for the experimental bindings that are consumers of clocks. Same for
PMU/regulator support.

No more "we know everything for this entire SoC on day 0" for bindings.
