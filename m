The only thing that could fail right now is the mux selection, so we
wouldn't get into some sort of situation where that's locked in and
unchangeable. We do rollback the role if it fails to switch, so we also
wouldn't go into a half-way state of being in one role but not actually
switching all the way over to it.

The host_start/host_stop functions are assigned to the same struct
ci_role_driver ops that udc_idc_switch_for_{device,host} are for the
gadget role. Really, these things are called from the same place by the
chipidea driver so not much is different between the two files I modify
to make the mux calls. Furthermore, we don't want to do this if we have
HNP or "true" OTG support so I've put it behind the ci_otg_is_fsm_mode()
check to make sure we don't do any muxing stuff based on fsm state
changes. It doesn't really make any sense here anyway because this
device I have doesn't support OTG, just role switching.
