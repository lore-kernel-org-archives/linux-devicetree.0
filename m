going to work smoothly. It will be actually almost impossible with serdev. =
However I did post btuart.c driver which is pretty much just plain H:4. You=
 would still somehow define the default baudraute since just picking 115200=
 is not always going to work.

Just to avoid some misunderstandings here. With this RFC patch I have only
devices in mind where we do not know any vendor specific commands and
do not need to do any firmware download.

n go from there. Either I dig this out and submit or someone else does.
>=20
Seems to be a good idea. So in the end I should not continue
that rtc patch?

And that thing has than a devicetree string of
"h4-generic" or a list of generic h4 devices?

Andreas
