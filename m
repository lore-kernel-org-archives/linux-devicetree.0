I've tested the patches again on ARM (OF) and x86-64 (ACPI).

I have V4L2 patches depending on the ACPI graph patchset that I'd like to
have in during the same merge window. Would you either accept a pull
request, or could I have a branch on top of v4.11-rc1 containing these
patches only (for media tree)?

The patchset "Move firmware specific code to firmware specific locations"
depends on "Fwnode property API fixes for OF, pset". Would you prefer to
send the bugfixes as fixes to v4.11 or just put it all to v4.12?
