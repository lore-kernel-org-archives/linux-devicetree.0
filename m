OK I get it, the situation is similar to some ACPI-based BIOSes on
PC where one needs to ask the firmware for misc services.

What would be nice is to standardize these APIs (like ACPI or device
tree does) so we don't end up with one per-SoC-specific driver per
system. But I guess it is not my pick.
