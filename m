Hi Patrick,

I held off on reviewing this until we'd hashed out what we needed in the driver.

I have some comments below.

The p2a-ctrl node is meant to be a child of the syscon. I noted this in my review
of the associated driver - you need to remove the description of the syscon
property.

The note above should go where you've described the syscon property above.
