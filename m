There are different versions. The kernel source clearly states
GPLv2 (I, personally, would prefer v3 to prevent Tivoization)

Do they really need to ?
One could ask, whether smb support should belong into the kernel
at all (instead of, eg., going via FUSE or 9P), but that's an
entirely different discussion.

Samba folks made the decision to prevent Tivoization of their code.
I fully agree with that decision, and I wish the same for the kernel.

Well, such things happen, if people have different views. In that case
those who want to prevent Tivoization on the one and those who wanna
allow it on the other side.

I rerely have the need to really copy-and-paste code from one project
to another. When patching existing ones, I just stick to the upstream's
license. And when starting new FOSS projects, I clearly choose (L)GPLv3=
,
because I'm strictly against Tivoization.

Well, that's a decision of the individual projects - everybody has
to live with his/her own decisions.

Seems to be a rare case to me. In general, I'd suggest making things
used by several distinct projects into their own distinct entities.

Note: the GPL's viral effect doesn't depend on whether the sources
are collected in one big repo, but on what is compiled-/linked-into
where.

It's not entirely FUD. The questions is NOT whether the original open
code will be wiped out of the net or people simply dont work on it
anymore. The main question here is, whether foss developers (often
working for free) want to help people producing non-free stuff. BSD
like to allow that, FSF folks dont. They just have different views on
that matter. IMHO, BSD folks are just interested in getting back
contributions, while FSF folks also have a broader political agenda. I,
personally, share that agenda (even more: I strongly believe that
software patents should be eradicated).

Well, I have an fundamentally different oppinion on that. If I publish
my code for free, I dont want assist anybody in producing non-free
stuff. (free like freedom, not free beer)

> Most of this can be laid at the door of GPLv3.

Because many folks don't wanna fight against Tivoization.
I'll have to accept that, but I don't need to coorporate.

The really interesting question is: why do they have that policy ?
Maybe because they aren't interested in *free* (as freedom) software,
but just open source.

Otherwise they'd have an strict policy of nothing proprietary in
kernel space.

Why would one want to mix bluez code with the kernel or samba ?

Apple belongs to the really bad guys, what Microsoft previously was.
This is the StaSi. I have no mercy for them.

=46or xcode vs gcc, I dont really see any actual license _conflict_.
This was an political action, and we should take it as that.
Apple is against freedom. The least thing, we - the people - should
do is not helping them, not giving them a single penny.

=46ine. They should do so. We don't need them. We lived happily without
them, and we'll continue to do so. SMB is just old legacy anyways,
just for interfacing with Toy-OS. (actually, I haven't had any single
Windows system for about 20 years - never missed that).

No, you sue them for the biggest policitical impact.
Yes: it is very much about politics.

CISCO distributed the devices, that's why the primary infringenment
was done by them. Of course, Boardcom should have been sued, too.

No. They (more precisely: we) will be satisfied, as long as you place
by the rules. And the rules are pretty clear - just read the text.
And if you don't like these rules, just pick something else.

Okay, that's a bad trick. Or just a bit stupidity.
Do we have evidence that this really was on purpose ?

Well, they still can use the old ones. And if they patch anything there=

they're free to decide whether to dual-license or not.

I haven't had a deeper look into QEMU source, but I wonder at which
places exactly it would make sense to share / transfer code from
kernel to QEMU. Any example ?

They just were asked to comply to their part of the deal.
And as they do now, no reason for whining about it anymore.

Maybe. Just let them do it if they wish. I don't really care.

You should learn the difference between opensource and free software.
  --> free like freedom, not free beer.

This is just a dumb auto-generated footer, coming from my client's
mail server over here ... I'm just too lazy for setting up an own
MTA on my workstation. You can safely ignore that.
