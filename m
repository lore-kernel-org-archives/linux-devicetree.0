Hmm.. I've rather confused by that warning. Per ePAPR and the
devicetree.org spec, the unit-addresss is meant to match the reg
property, and no mention is made of the ranges property. So I do not
think that it is necessary to require this.

That warning seems to have gone into DTC in commit c9d9121683b35281
("Warn on node name unit-address presence/absence mismatch").

Rob, Stephen, was there some discussion that prompted ranges requiring
a matching unit-address?

Thanks,
Mark.
