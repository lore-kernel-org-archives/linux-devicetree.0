Based on the devices listed in the block diagram (and not including
those on the AXI bus):
i2c 0x18038000
spi 0x18027200
gpio 0x18000060
pwm 0x18031000
wdt 0x18039000

and a few others.  

Looking at the sources, all the ARM IP is 0x19000000 and the rest is
0x18000000.  The only part that is a little harry is the clocks, which
have BCM and ARM (which causes the addresses to be both 0x19000000 and
0x18000000).  But, we can handle that when we upstream that part (which
should be very soon).
