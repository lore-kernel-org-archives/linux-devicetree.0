Update DT bindings to represent hierarchical CPU and CPU domain idle states
for PSCI. Also update the PSCI examples to clearly show how flattened and
hierarchical idle states can be represented in DT.

Changes in v2:
	- Addressed comments from Rob.
	- Updated some labels in the examples to get more consistency.

For your information, I have picked up the work from Lina Iyer around the so
called CPU cluster idling series [1,2] and I working on new versions. However,
I decided to post the updates to the PSCI DT bindings first, as they will be
needed to be agreed upon before further changes can be done to the PSCI firmware
driver.

Note, these bindings have been discussed over and over again, at LKML, but
especially also at various Linux conferences, like LPC and Linaro Connect. We
finally came to a conclusion and the changes we agreed upon, should be reflected
in this update.

Of course, it's a while ago since the latest discussions, but hopefully people
don't have too hard time to remember.

Kind regards
Uffe

+PSCI v1.0 onwards, supports OS-Initiated mode for powering off CPUs and CPU
+clusters from the firmware. For such topologies the PSCI firmware driver acts
+as pseudo-controller, which may be specified in the psci DT node. The
+definitions of the CPU and the CPU cluster topology, must conform to the domain
+idle state specification [3]. The domain idle states themselves, must be
+compatible with the defined 'domain-idle-state' binding [1], and also need to
+specify the arm,psci-suspend-param property for each idle state.
+
+DT allows representing CPU and CPU cluster idle states in two different ways -
+
+The flattened model as given in Example 1, lists CPU's idle states followed by
+the domain idle state that the CPUs may choose. This is the general practice
+followed in PSCI firmwares that support Platform Coordinated mode. Note that
+the idle states are all compatible with "arm,idle-state".
+
+Example 2 represents the hierarchical model of CPU and domain idle states.
+CPUs define their domain provider in their DT node. The domain controls the
+power to the CPU and possibly other h/w blocks that would be powered off when
+the CPU is powered off. The CPU's idle states may therefore be considered as
+the domain's idle states and have the compatible "arm,idle-state". Such domains
+may be embedded within another domain that represents common h/w blocks between
+these CPUs viz. the cluster. The idle states of the cluster would be
+represented as the domain's idle states. In order to use OS-Initiated mode of
+PSCI in the firmware, the hierarchical representation must be used.
+
+Example 1: Flattened representation of CPU and domain idle states
+	cpus {
+		#address-cells = <1>;
+		#size-cells = <0>;
+
+		CPU0: cpu@0 {
