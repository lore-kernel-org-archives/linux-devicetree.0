I can rephrase your use case as wanting to boot kernels M > N where N
is the first working mainline kernel. I think we all want that.

But it doesn't concretely tie back to stable DTB as the only possible
solution. As you pointed out we could do this with board.c files.

In other words, I don't think it is a compelling justification.

Bollocks. User space API development is the single most difficult
thing to do in the kernel. It is much harder than any other change,
and stable ABI DT is elevated to *that* level.
