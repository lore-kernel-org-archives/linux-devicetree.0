If this is a standard, then maybe this should be explicitly documented and
pushed to all other maintainers so it isn't escaping review? Otherwise you're
left with a disparity which suggests it isn't standard at all. Personally I
stand by that for device specific bindings this shouldn't apply as it gains
nothing except achieving an overly long binding, or you end up cutting down the
descriptive part of the name to accommodate units at the end.
