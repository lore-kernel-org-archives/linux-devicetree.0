Yes, I know, and since arm_dma_limit becomes 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
now if LPAE is enabled and ZONE_DMA unset, so we have to set
dev->coherent_dma_mask as so big, otherwise __dma_alloc() can't go
ahead.

But please see below words in Documentation/DMA-API.txt:

           Further, the physical address of the memory must be within the
           dma_mask of the device (the dma_mask represents a bit mask of the
           addressable region for the device.  I.e., if the physical address of
           the memory anded with the dma_mask is still equal to the physical
           address, then the device can perform DMA to the memory).

You may argue that the description is about dev->dma_mask, but the
usage should be same.

In fact, most of devices in ARM SoC(even with LPAE enabled) doesn't
support 64bit DMA, so I don't see the point that the default mask is set
as 64bit.

Also we might need to consider why ppc64 didn't do that previously.

Looks the default 64bit mask isn't reasonable, is it?

No, device can't set the mask any more since any other value which is less
than (u64)-1 can't succeed, and looks that is the current problem.
