Yes, those are three separate supplies that are typically tied together
- it looks like PVDD has high current draw so is tied through multiple
pins.  I'd not be surprised to see systems with AVDD tied to a separate
pin, analogue supplies often benefit from low noise supplies separate to
digital ones.  Indeed if you look at the pin descriptions the analogue
and digital supplies even have separate grounds.

That's more likely to go wrong if they're not controlled separately than
if they are since we will only be able to turn a single supply on or
off..

Have the driver accurately reflect the hardware, request one regulator
per supply.
