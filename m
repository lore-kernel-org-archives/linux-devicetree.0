Hi everyone,

I recently came across a difference in behaviour of OF phandle parsing and
ACPI reference parsing, both of which can soon be accessed using
fwnode_property_get_reference_args.

The main change in this proposal touches OF, and specifically the change
is about using -ENODATA to tell that the phandle reference list entry that
was accessed does not exist. -ENOENT was used previously, but the same
error code was also used to tell that a phandle was empty, making it
impossible for the caller to figure out which of the two was the case.

I'm sending the set as RFC. In my limited testing I have found no ill
effects.

These patches are on top of linux-next.

Comments on the approach and the changes themselves would be most welcome.

For what it's worth, fwnode_property_get_reference_args is in Rafael's
tree (as well as in linux-next) and hasn't reached mainline yet. It will
be used in the near future for parsing references to external devices in
the V4L2 framework.

These patches can be found here:

Sakari Ailus (5):
  clk: Increment assigned-clocks index for empty phandles
  of: Return -ENODATA on accessing out of bounds indices in phandle
    parsing
  of: Return total number of entries in of_count_phandle_with_args
  ACPI: align acpi_fwnode_get_reference_args with OF counterpart
  device property: Document fwnode_property_get_reference_args better
