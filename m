Already done. :)

Correct, but using less cells than in the root node requires a ranges
mapping, and we don't have size information available for that. So I
would rather leave it like this initially.

By my definition, SoC is the whole memory range.

And as pointed out in the v1 cover letter, I don't have sufficient
documentation for this chip - there's not even a general address map in
the datasheet, nor any bus information - so any attempt to restrict it
would be a wild guess and specific to the 2G .dts rather than suitable
for the generic .dtsi here.

If we had the info, I would still want to leave the soc node like this
and instead have bus sub-nodes with suitable ranges, like we did for
meson-gxbb. I don't see harm in having the .dts be a few cells larger.

I have in the meantime tested that 1k, 2k, 2k, 2k plus PPI 9 lets KVM
initialize the vGIC:

[    0.256915] kvm [1]: 8-bit VMID
[    0.256951] kvm [1]: IDMAP page: 73f000
[    0.256986] kvm [1]: HYP VA range: 800000000000:ffffffffffff
[    0.257417] kvm [1]: Hyp mode initialized successfully
[    0.257479] kvm [1]: vgic-v2@ff014000
[    0.257554] kvm [1]: vgic interrupt IRQ1
[    0.257600] kvm [1]: virtual timer IRQ4

As usual, not yet tested with a guest for lack of proper rootfs.

Mark, is there any benefit in using a raw 0xf mask over a simple 4, when
there are only 4 CPUs? I tested the simple 4 copied from my S900,
whereas the timer based on the vendor device tree uses raw 0xf, i.e.,
simple 8. Should I change that to be consistently simple 4?

Additionally I am dropping the irq.h include, because arm-gic.h already
does that for us.

Andreas
