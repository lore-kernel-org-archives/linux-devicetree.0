Well, both. Primarily we need firmware running to get the info. If board
ID is missing in OTP the value from nvram file is used. If board ID in
OTP is wrong we are screwed :-p

Right. I suppose the bindings update and driver update should preferably
be in the same kernel release although bindings are supposedly OS agnostic.
