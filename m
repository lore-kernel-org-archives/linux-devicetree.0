Hi Frank,

Thank you for the review.

How about this as the commit message combining the two and dropping the 
last sentence from the original description:

base.c contains both core OF functions and increasingly other
functionality such as accessing properties and graphs, including
convenience functions. In the near future this would also include OF
specific implementation of the fwnode property and graph APIs.

Create driver/of/property.c to contain procedures for accessing and
interpreting device tree properties. The procedures are moved from
drivers/of/base.c, with no changes other than copying only the
includes required by the moved procedures.

I'll add that.

I'll add something along those lines. The fwnode op struct and the 
operations in that will be in this file as well.
