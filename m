To the broadcom kernel maintainers, (for BCM4708 CPUs)

I just want to add a little attention to this patch again...
let me know if there's any concerns and I will try to address highlighted i=
ssues
as soon as possible.

I've been running the development builds of OpenWrt kernels, where
this patch has
been included, on my Linksys EA6500v2 router for the past months,
updating as new
builds are available. With only the on board BCM4360 chip (5GHz WiFi) is be=
ing
disabled, has so far been stable for my use case.

thank you for the consideration
Rene (aka Katana_Steel)
