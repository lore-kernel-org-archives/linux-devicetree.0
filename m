You could add a bunch of macros to help with that, and wrap the actual
functions so that you'd find the ops using the macro. It'd be less pretty
than having an ops pointer in the struct, I agree.

I should have phrased that differently. The OF node (or fwnode_handle)
pointers are stored locally in driver specific structs. Now that I look at
that more closely, the only problems appears to be that most forget
of_node_get() but that's unrelated to this.

Per node. Going forward, 8 is getting more and more common.

With the patchset, there are 14 occurrences of is_of_node() and 12
occurrences of is_acpi_node(). Before the numbers were 6 and 4,
respectively.

I think it'd be good to have a third opinion on that.

I presume you'd prefer these changes done before this set?

The graph code is generic, what V4L2 has concerning OF is common parsing of
the properties. That's the current state at least.

Please see drivers/media/platform/omap3isp/isp.c, and isp_of_parse_nodes()
there. This is where the omap3isp driver parses information originating from
DT. That's a pretty good example, most other V4L2 drivers that work with OF
nodes do something similar.

isp_of_parse_nodes() function could certainly be improved, but the
improvement would be related to the interface of V4L2 async framework.
That's not really related to DT or graphs.

The V4L2 async framework is already aware of DT but it just makes it
possible to match devices using OF nodes. It could well facilitate the
process a lot more than it does now.

I wonder if something similar could be done for DRM.

I'd like to question whether that really helps: you need to iterate over all
the ports and all the endpoints in them, instead of being simply given all
the endpoints that have connected devices, one by one. At least when it
comes to V4L2, I prefer the latter. As noted, I believe the enumerating
work could (and should) be moved to the V4L2 async framework.

It does show the firmware concepts to the driver but is there any harm from
doing so?
