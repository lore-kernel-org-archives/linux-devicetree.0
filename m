Isn't the compatible list precisely made to be able to define more
specific behaviours if needed?

If I get a list with "sunxi,framebuffer", "simple-framebuffer", I've
always thought that sunxi,framebuffer was defining exactly what the
device was about, and that simple-framebuffer was only aimed at
providing roughly the same functionnality, possibly with degraded
features, and with a compatible DT bindings.

I don't see how if we require a clock-names list in sunxi,framebuffer
that would break the binding of simple-framebuffer. It's just more
information, that might prove useful in the future.

I'm not speaking about u-boot here, but the kernel itself.

What if we want from that pipeline property to enable (or rather keep
enabled) only a few clocks, and not all of them?
