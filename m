Yes, all the supplies.  I'd misremembered which ones you were saying
were tied together on your board.

To repeat, the typical case is *not* *relevant*.  All that matters is
the set of supplies the device has.

Please group them into supplies as documented in the datasheet.  If they
are documented as distinct things they should be distinct things, if
they are just the same supply coming in through multiple pins for power
reasons they should be one supply.
