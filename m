DT uses a node called either "port" or "ports" to store the port nodes. 
The reg property tells the number of the port (see 
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt). I'm no DT expert, but my 
understanding is that the node namespace is different from the property 
namespace.

If you're concerned of possible double meanings, it's entirely possible 
to put the port nodes under hierarchical data extension named e.g. 
"ports", and document that this is what the node must be called (single 
port node could be just called "port"). This way, it should be much more 
difficult to interpret a non-port node as a port node --- roughly 
equivalent of the DT ports node.

The drawback with this change is that the size of the data structure in 
ASL (and AML) will grow.
