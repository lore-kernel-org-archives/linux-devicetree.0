I'd rather not take any dts changes through clk tree.

I'd expect this to only contain nodes that don't have a reg
property. Clock providers that have a reg property would go into
some soc node or bus. Perhaps that's the chipcommonA node, or
axi?

We're trying to move away from putting individual clocks into DT
like this. Is there some sort of clock controller that's at
0x1800c000, but we're just not exposing all the clocks in there?
See this thread for more information on why we'd like to avoid
this sort of design:
