Hi Jassi,

Thanks for reviewing the patch.

Here is the rationale for choosing the name:
There are more than 1 IPC in TI SoCs and even within Keystone SoC.
Further, it is indeed called message manager hardware block and used
across multiple SoC families (even though it is originated by keystone
architecture). we do have a reuse of the omap-mailbox in a future
keystone device (in addition to message manager), so using ti-mailbox is
more appropriate for omap-mailbox, but anyways.. further renaming this
as keystone-mailbox will confuse poor users when the new SoC comes in..

We do have a lot of cross pollination of hardware blocks across TI
architectures, and "keystone-" prefix does not really fit the usage.
hence the usage of vendor-hardwareblock name.

Sure, I can. Since I followed include/linux/omap-mailbox.h, Would you
suggest all files such as include/linux/omap* be moved to
include/linux/soc/ti/ ? I guess that is not pertinent to this specific
patch, but I am curious..

OK-> to explain this, few reasons: (queue messages check and usage of
last_tx_done are kind of intertwined answer..
a) we need to remember that the message manager has a shared RAM.
multiple transmitter over other queues can be sharing the same.
unfortunately, we dont get a threshold kind of interrupt or status that
I am able to exploit in the current incarnation of the solution. The
best we can do in the full system is to constrain the number of messages
that are max pending simultaneously in each of the queue from various
transmitters in the SoC.
b) last_tx_done() is checked if TXDONE_BY_POLL, not if TXDONE_BY_ACK
right? which is how this'd work since txdone_poll is false -> that is
how we want this mechanism to work once the far end is ready for next
message, it acks. I do see your point about being tied to protocol - I
dont like it either.. in fact, I'd prefer that client registration
mention what kind of handshaking is necessary, but: a) that is not how
mailbox framework is constructed at the moment(we state txdone_poll at
mailbox registration, not at client usage) and b) I have no real need
for multiple clients to users of message manager who actually need
non-ACK usage - even for the foreseeable future (at least 1 next
generation of SoC) - if such a need does arise in the future, I will
have to rework framework and make this capability at the registration
time of the client - allowing each client path to use different
mechanisms on hardware such as these that need it.
c) message manager can actually queue more than one message(depending on
client capability). Even though, at this point, we are not really
capable of doing it(again from what I can see for immediate future),
mailbox framework by checking last_tx_done forces a single message
sequencing - which is not really exploiting the capability of the
hardware - in theory, we should be able to queue max num messages, hit
cpuidle and snooze away while the remote entity chomp away data at it's
own pace and finally give us a notification back - but again, we can
argue it is indeed protocol dependent, so setting txdone_poll to false
actually enables that to be done in user. Again - i have no immediate
need for any queued multiple transfer needs yet.. even if i need to, in
the future, it can easily be done by the client by maintaining code as
is - txdone_poll is false.

Tell me about it.. but then, surprises like these do pop in once in a

These are SoC integration specific data. based on DT, we will only have
SoC specific compatible property in DT. Since  the data is tied to SoC
integration, there is no benefit of keeping these in DT.
