Sorry, I was a little hasty there.

This patch depends on the presence of R8A774A1_CLK_CANFD which
(rightly) is added in a different patch in this series which is to
go upstream via a different tree.

I have dropped this patch for now. I think there are two solution to this
problem.

1. Provide a version of this patch which uses a numeric index instead of
   R8A774A1_CLK_CANFD. And then, once R8A774A1_CLK_CANFD is present in an
   RC release provide a patch to switch to using R8A774A1_CLK_CANFD.

2. Defer this patch until R8A774A1_CLK_CANFD is present in an RC release.
