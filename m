When I first read your email, I agreed, and started down the path of
dropping the rename, then...

If a board has two different, especially destructive, configurations, it
should have two different compatible strings.  Especially since 90% (I'm
swagging) of a distro's use of dtbs is to upgrade the dtb on an already
installed system.  They'll most likely pull the board compatible string
from /proc/device-tree/compatible, and then go hunt for the dtb.

That's why I prefer to rename the dtbs, it removes the need to parse the
dtb (fdtget *isn't* currently built/installed by default in dtc), and it
allows distros, for the most common use case, to easily find a matching
dtb on an existing system.

In the event that an already deployed dtb is found to have an alternate
rev (with or without destructive changes), on our side, we add a more
specific compatible string and a new dts for the new rev.  The distro
dtb upgrader detects it's on a 'globalscale,mirabox' and sees that the
options are now globalscale,mirabox-rev1.dtb and
globalscale,mirabox-rev2.dtb.  It throws up a user prompt asking the
user to determine which board rev it's on.  Or, if safe to do so, it
programatically determines which rev it is on and updates the dtb.

All I'm suggesting doing is extending the same standard we have for
compatible strings at the node level to the board level.  If we don't
change the filename, then we *have* to extend the consistent naming to
the dts files as well.

I think it's just as easy to say "you need globalscale,mirabox-rev1 now"
as anything else.

kept for context, above.

thx,
