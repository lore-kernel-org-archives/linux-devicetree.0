Such config option is therefore pointless.

So you're basically saying that we should split the development effort 
across multiple trees instead of encouraging people to converge on the 
same tree?  This is completely contrary to all the efforts we've been 
deploying to encourage people to submit their code upstream.

If as an end user you want full QA, you should go with a distro kernel.

We're talking about the upstream kernel here, and given the current 
development and release rate we hardly can guarantee you that it'll be 
free of unfinished work (as long as it doesn't regress existing 
features).
