Thanks, I was indeed looking at an old version.
Still, that doesn't change that the clock to not be disabled in specified
explicitly from DT.

It's supposed to be on when the application ARM core(s) is/are running.
Many SoCs also have smaller cores (SH, Cortex R or M), intended to
run a real-time OS. If the RT core is in charge, it may decide to shut down
the application ARM core(s), incl. supposedly always-on modules like
the ARM GIC.

I couldn't find a detailed block diagram of the STiH4xx SoCs, but at least
STiH416 has an "ST proprietary multi-compartmental security IP and DRM
processor".
