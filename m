To be clear, I meant selecting LPAE from config options specific to
S70-evb and PCI on S7x.

Sorry I am not sure what you mean. Is it ok as such?

We could cook something up, but as Nico suggested a better place to
set mcpm ops is from where we do other other mcpm setup.

Here is what I remember of many discussions on the point over the last year :)
o  We want to support zero-copy receives, which implies the mailbox
framework must simply forward the pointer to "data packet" from
controller to client driver.
o  We could not think of a generic enough structure for 'data packet'
that could fit all protocols. So we assume the data packet format is
an explicit understanding between the controller(+remote) and the
client driver.

Or did I miss your point?

Probably bailing out of the loop and returning -ETIMEOUT to the
caller, before a WARN(), is the simplest way to die.

We are not worried about the atomic access because the side sending
the data doesn't touch it until the other side indicates it has
consumed it.
