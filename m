It does not need to be familiar with the board to find that out.  I'm
not familiar with the board either, but I gave the answer.

Since you get there, you should be the one cleaning that up.  You will
need to touch those board files anyway, since you need to add audmux
device for those boards.  So no hardware for testing is not an excuse.
For those boards, all you need to do are:

 * Change and compile-test the code
 * Cc board maintainers when submitting the patch

We will wait for board maintainers to respond for a reasonable period
of time.  If we do not get any response during the time, we will send
patch upstream anyway.
