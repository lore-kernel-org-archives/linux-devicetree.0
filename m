What about compiling the dts?

By who? Any bindings in a series I always expect the subsystem
maintainers to take the whole series. That doesn't solve the problem
though as there is still a dependency between a subsystem tree and
arm-soc typically.

Arnd and Olof have been complaining about this problem which is worse
when it is a binding, driver and dts.

I'm open to maintaining a branch for this purpose if that helps. That
or staggering merging of bindings and drivers/dts are the only ideas
I've come up with.

I think that is wrong if we have the goal to separate bindings from
the kernel and the bindings should stand on their own. However, if it
greatly simplifies things, i'd be okay with that.
