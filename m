I think you misunderstood Stefano's comment. Whilst the clock bindings 
is set in stone, the binding you are adding in this patch is not yet 
fixed. There is no requirement to follow what was defined in 
clock-bindings.txt. I agree it would be convenient, but as mentioned by 
Stefano this will need to be supported for a long time by Xen, Linux, 
and any other consumer (i.e BSD kernels). So we have to be careful on 
how it has been defined.

I would wait the answer of Michael on Stefano's question before taking 
any decision here.

The Linux kernel is not the only consumer of the device tree bindings. 
This is also used by other OS such as FreeBSD where you might already be 
able (I have not actually checked) to forbid a user to change the clock 
rate.

Very easy. What does prevent a driver to change the clock rate? Nothing 
but the flags mentioned by Michael. There are already drivers which 
modify the clock rate, thankfully those clocks are not shared with the 
UART for now.

But we cannot rule out that it will not be possible in the future. Think 
about a clock that would be used by another guest (I know it is still 
theoretical as we have not yet solved the problem).
