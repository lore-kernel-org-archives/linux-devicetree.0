Usually the system as a whole is specified to have some particular kind
of microphone attached (or soldered in) and this follows from that.
There's typically also soldered down analogue components that are
selected based on the bias voltage so a specific system likely won't
have the full flexibility.

That'd depend on someone having a board that was able to detect that a
line input was plugged in or a user control for this.  If the board was
permenantly set up for line input presumably the bias wouldn't even be
wired up.
