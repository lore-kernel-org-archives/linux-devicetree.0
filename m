We've allowed similar properties for other things like SPI controllers.

It really depends on the frequency you expect to change it. The more 
often it changes, the higher up the s/w stack it should be controlled 
(firmware/DT, kernel, or userspace). A function of the SOC or codec 
rate, then yes DT is fine. Every user needs to tune it on the same 
platform, then no, don't put it in DT. My recollection from i.MX is this 
would be the former case.
