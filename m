Nope this is not specfic to dmaengine. Perhaps drivers/base/..

Per Linus, driver should load firmware on first open. So either you should
do it while channel allocation or first descriptor allocation.

I think nowait version is better. Why do you need
CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER?

channel allocation or descriptor allocation

Hmmm, there are two parts, one is requesting the firmware and second is the
loading part.

Since descriptor allocation is atomic in nature, I think we should load the
firmware using nowait version and if you can atomically copy then do so at
first descriptor allocation. If not then you should copy in nowait handler

I think that makes sense, relying on deferred probing seems a better way to
manage
