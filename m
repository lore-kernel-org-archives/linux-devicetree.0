There are 2 possible S/PDIF pins in the tda998x, and there may be many
audio chips with S/PDIF outputs.

In my original version, the audio-ports are a bitmap of the pins, the
bit 0 being the WS used for I2S. A fully wired tda998x would have been
as:

	audio-ports =3D <0x03>, <0x04>, <0x09>, <0x11>;
	audio-port-names =3D "i2s", "spdif", "i2s", "i2s";

With the new version, it would simply become:

	audio-inputs =3D "i2s", "spdif", "i2s", "i2s";
