"coresight" is not a vendor and properties are in the form 
[<vendor>,]<prop-name>.

There shouldn't be a unit address here because there is no reg property.

It doesn't make sense for these to be in the endpoint. If you had 
multiple endpoints, then you would have to duplicate it. "ports" are 
a single data stream. "endpoints" are connections to that stream. So if 
you have a muxed (input) or fanout/1-to-many (output) connection, then 
you have multiple endpoints. 

The same applied to the slave-mode property, but that ship has sailed. 
No reason to continue that though.

This will still get flagged as an error. reg must be 2 here.
