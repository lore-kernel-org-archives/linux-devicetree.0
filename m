Okay, you got me: I was to lazy to test that :-).
Anyway, I just did it, and apparently this clock is mandatory (the
platform hangs when launching crypto requests if the clock is not
referenced by the crypto device).

I'll send a patch adding this clock to the armada-370 clock driver and
I'll fix the dtsi accordingly.

Thanks,

Boris
