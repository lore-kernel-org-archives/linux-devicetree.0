Well, I was suggesting cloning it just to have a look at the new
code, but I understand you don't want to attempt to bring in your
SMIA/bayer format changes and run from this branch, due to the
other changes in the mediatree.

I suppose I should post the next version then.

Trouble is, I see issues in the current driver that prevents working
with your SMIA pipeline. But I guess that will have to be worked out
in another version.
