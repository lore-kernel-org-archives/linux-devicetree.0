Yes, but it is not irrelevent. In my case this same DT is supporting
3.10 and 3.12 kernels - 3.10 doesn't even have a MBUS driver or
dynamic PEX driver and it relies upon the ranges entry matching the
static bootloader configuration to work properly.

So the 'ranges matching bootloader' does have a use case.

That is about where I am at too..

I'm not clear on that either, but it seems plausible..

I agree, some kind of callback scheme would really be needed.. Sort of
like the xlate callback we have for IRQs?

So the mbus would register an address xlate for its node that is
called instead of ranges parsing. For the example in my last message
the FPGA driver would register an xlate that made addresses relative
to its own BAR0 address.

Exactly.

Right, the general case is totally borked here - the dynamic changes
to the address map by MBUS and PCI are not being reflected to the
of_address machinery, be they from MBUS or from PCI BAR assignment.

However, address assignment is very predicatble, so if you have a
constrained system it can work.

In the normal DT use case (eg on a SPARC or something) the DT itself
would be self-consistent with the addresses assigned from the firmware
and the PCI machinery should try to respect the bootloader addresses
if they are workable during address assignment.

So it isn't as dire as 'pure luck' :)
