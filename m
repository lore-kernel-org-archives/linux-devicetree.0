I did not know that, my apology.

This is true for various entries as well as arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile.
I am wondering how far we should stick to alphabetical sorting.


For example, do you recommend OF compatible tables should be sorted
alphabetically?


arch/arm/mach-uniphier/uniphier.c:

static const char * const uniphier_dt_compat[] __initconst = {
        "socionext,ph1-sld3",
        "socionext,ph1-ld4",
        "socionext,ph1-pro4",
        "socionext,ph1-sld8",
        "socionext,ph1-pro5",
        "socionext,proxstream2",
        "socionext,ph1-ld6b",
        NULL,
};

This table (only containing SoC names) is currently sorted
chronologically, and the logic
is the same as arch/arm/boot/dts/Makefile.


This file belongs to my maintainer-ship, but I just wonder
which sorting rule, chronologically or alphabetically, is better in general.
