That doesn't make a huge degree of sense - your non-specific "certain
platform scenarios" are almost certainly going to be DVFS things where
you need to boost the voltage of the LDO when the device needs to
operate at particularly high frequencies in which case the driver really
ought to just manage the voltage appropriately as required (ideally only
boosting it at the times where the extra load exists).

Unless you can be more specific about what the intended use is this just
doesn't seem like something we should be specifying in DT.

Yes.
