This is used as suffix to the PMU name. hisi_l3c<scl-id>. (hisi_l3c2 - 
for scl-id = 2).
This is to identify the pmu correspond to which CPU die in the socket.

My idea is to have the common properties of SoC PMU added here.
The num-events, num-counters etc. So that handling can be made common in 
the driver.
Is it not recommended? Please share your comments.

As for the hip05/06 and 07 chips, the above four properties are same, I 
shall
move them to the driver.

The below two properties (module-id, cfgen-map) differs between chips 
hip05/06 and hip07.
There were moved here so as to have minimal changes in driver across 
chips hip05/06/07.

OR whether it is more recommended to have the of_device_id .data set 
accordingly for handling
different chip versions?

Please suggest.

Yes each bank is a separate instance of PMU.
If it is recommended to have each L3 cache bank registered as separate 
PMU with perf, then this property will be removed.

The bank number will start from "1" till "4" for L3 cache as there are 
four banks in hip05/06/07 chips.

This is used as suffix to the PMU name. hisi_ddrc<scl-id>_<ch-id>. 
(hisi_ddrc2_0 - for scl-id = 2, ddrc channel = 0).
This is to identify the pmu correspond to which DDRC channel.
