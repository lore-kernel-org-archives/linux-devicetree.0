Nicolas has been the de-facto maintainer of AT91 for quite a while
now, even though more of them are listed on the maintainers entry. It
would be inappropriate to merge something that he disagreed with on
that platform.

It seems appropriate to ask the at91 folks to come back with a
solution that everybody is OK with, and until then hold off merging
this.
