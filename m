At first, I was going to say I disagree completely, but I do see your point.

I don't think that having a separate reset controller concept in DT, and
having a GPIO implementation of that, is purely exposing Linux concepts
in the DT. It's just one way of looking at the HW. As you say, another
is that any external chip that needs reset has a GPIO input.

The history here is that we have to concept of IP modules inside a chip
that can be reset, and that reset is driven by some external entity to
the IP block, and hence there's a concept of a "reset controller" that
drives that reset. That enables arbitrary different implementations to
cover the case of the IP block being dropped into different SoCs with
different ways of resetting it.

Extend that same concept to external chips that happen to have GPIOs
driving the chip's reset inputs, and you get this GPIO reset controller
binding.

On the surface, any external chip is going to be reset by a GPIO, and
hence that should be represented by a property in that external chip's
DT node, just as you say.

But what if the reset pin is /not/ hooked up to a GPIO? What if there's
a dedicated "reset" HW device that drives the reset input, and all it
can do is pulse the reset, not maintain it at some static level, and
hence that signal can't be represented as a GPIO? Or what if the core of
the external chip gets integrated into an SoC, which has a reset
controller rather than a GPIO input? Of course, I have no idea how
likely this would be.

To cover those cases, continuing to abstract the reset input
semantically as a reset input, rather than as a plain GPIO, might make
sense.

If we decide to ignore the case where the reset signal isn't driven by a
GPIO, yes, the above binding does look better.
