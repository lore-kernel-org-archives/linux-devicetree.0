All cpus will be initialized w/t 800MHz, suppose the dynamic leakage is high;
w/t Bintian's patches, suppose the cpuidle also has not been enabled;
so there also have static leakage even cpus run into "wfi" state.

I also have not exactly power data for SoC, but suppose the leakage is
high.

We are integrate Hisilicon's MCU firmware, which is the similiar
module w/t Juno's SCP. It will support mainly two functionality:

- CPU Frequency Scaling;

  CPUFreq driver has been merged yet. [2]

  For CPU frequency scaling part, Due MCU FW has some updating from
  hisilicon, so we need re-work cpu clock driver. [1]

- CPUIdle and system's low power state;

  This part need integrate ARM-TF w/t MCU FW to support PSCI;

Now we are using thermal framework to monitor thermal and if
temperature hit the trip point it will take cpu as cooling device and
set limitation for cpu's max frequency. [3]
