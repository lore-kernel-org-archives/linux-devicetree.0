As a minor variation of your suggestion, how about passing in a pointer
to struct pci_host_bridge, and embed that within its own private
structure? I think this is closer to how a lot of other subsystems
do the abstraction.

Makes sense. One of the areas where the PCI code shows its age is the
method how the various parts link together: there are function calls
going back and forth between architecture specific files and generic
files, rather a hierarchy of files with generic code being code by more
specific code.

To do the probing properly, I think it's totally fine to have the
core code expect stuff like the resources and domain number
to be filled out already by whoever calls it, but then have wrappers
around it that get this information from a firmware interface, or
from hardwired architecture specific code where necessary.
