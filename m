Add them when you find that you actually need them.

Serial to get stable tty names. It used to be for the console too, but
stdout-path property should be used instead.
ethernet for u-boot to determine which interface to net boot from (IIRC).
i2c and spi are also for stable /dev names, but that should be handled
another way IMO. You can find discussions about it in the archives.

Anything else is probably questionable.
