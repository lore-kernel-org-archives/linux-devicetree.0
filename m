This patchset adds Reset Controller (RMU) support for Actions Semi
Owl SoCs, S900 and S700. For the Owl SoCs, RMU has been integrated into
the clock subsystem in hardware. Hence, in software we integrate RMU
support into common clock driver inorder to maintain compatibility.

This patch series depends on the recently posted S700 clk series:
"[PATCH v7 0/5] Add clock driver for Actions S700 SoC". For the S700 clk
series, driver and bindings patches are applied through the clk tree.
But the DTS patches are not yet picked up by the platform maintainer,
Andreas.

Hence, Andreas is expected to pick the DTS patches in this series once
reviewed by the maintainers along with S700 clk DTS patches.

Because of the absence of the S500 SoC clk support, the reset controller
registration code is added to both S700 and S900 SoC clk drivers for now.
But once S500 clk support is added, the reset controller registration part
will be moved to Owl SoCs common clk code.

Thanks,
Mani
