Ok, I guess that's correct, then.

As a newcomer to the Linux kernel a while ago, I found the plethora of
rather descriptive config help text really helpful.


These days, there are too many items (particulary from vendor trees)
where the help text, if present at all, is something like:

config BLAG_SLAD_BUP
	help
	  Enable the BLAG slad bup


or

config SCARY_UNSAFE_ONLY_ENABLE_IF_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_IT_DOES

	(no help to explain what the option does)

or examples such as the RCU subsystem, where although the invididual
items are reasonably documented, there is nowhere a statement of
what RCU does, why you want it, or even what it stands for.  Of
course, it's obvious to people who already know what it is, but
those aren't the people who documentation is written for.



I think we should do our best to sustain the quality, especially for
early examples of particular features which may get used as exemplars.

I know -- I did say it was a pedantic point.  Change that or not, as you
wish.

Happy to go with your judgment on that.
