Since we are now targetting 3.7, I would rather come up with proper DT clock 
bindings, which should make the mcs814x clock driver much nicer.

If we could get them merged during 3.6 that would allow me, and other ARM-soc 
maintainers to get their stuff fully migrated to DT. Are there any blockers to 
these patches?
