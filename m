Right, that's what Rob suggested as to how it should be exposed to
userspace. I think Mark is suggesting that it can also be done by
returning appropriately fine-grained error codes from a writeable
attribute.

Just to clarify here, I brought this up because if we only allow
the writes to fail, there's not necessarily not enough information
available to know if they failed due to a real error (perhaps write
cycles for the underlying nvmem device have been exhausted) or is
it simply that the underlying device has been hardware write protected
(such as as the write protect pin hardwired that way or it's an OTP
device). The client, whether userspace or otherwise is going to need
to know this information to make informed policy decisions.
