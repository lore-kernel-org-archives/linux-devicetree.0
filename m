When the HDMI controller device node was added, the needed PLL clock
macros were not exported. A separate patch addresses that, but it is
merged through a different tree.

Now that both patches are in mainline proper, we can convert the raw
numbers to proper macros.

This is the remain bits of the HDMI series, converting raw index
numbers in the device tree to ccu macros. This is a fix for 4.15.
I've put all the platforms in one patch, though we should have done
sun5i for the previous release.
