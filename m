I think the main problem for doing this way is that the meaning of id
return by of_alias_get_id may be not persistent.
e.g
For MX6SX
aliases {
	can0 = &flexcan1;
	can1 = &flexcan2;
	can2 = &m_can1;
	can3 = &m_can2;
	...
}

For other platform, it could be:
aliases {
	can0 = &m_can1;
	can1 = &m_can2;
	...
}
It's hard for driver to use.

And actually the M_CAN driver does not need to use the alias.
So i wonder if it makes sense to add the alias for m_can devices
like that.
