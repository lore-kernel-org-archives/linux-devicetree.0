If its perdectly legal, than I'm personally against changing it.
Mainly because it makes it difficult for git and patch to apply
patches from the vendor kernel on top of the upstream kernel
without manual intervention.

I already ran into this with the recent stih407-pinctrl series
where every patch had to be manually fixed up because we changed
PIO to pio, on every pin definition.

I'm all for changing things where they are actually wrong in the
vendor kernel (such as not having the unit address on the reg property,
or the node name being wrong e.g. fdma to dma-controller etc. But this
doesn't appar to be one of those cases.

regards,

Peter.
