Will fix in v2.

Yes it is the version number of the IP.

Well the FDMA controller does, but this is a seperate piece of hw
which is really a router rather than a controller.

However I plan on temporarily removing xbar from this series,
as I think it should be re-worked to use the of_dma_router_register
and friends provided by the TI xbar driver.

It looks like the two xbar hw are serving a very similar purpose,
so once that re-work is done it can also use generic DMA propoerties
as I believe using that framework it will get registered as a controlle=
r.

Obviously I can trivially change it, but out of interest is there
a technical reason for doing so? Clearly it works OK with
an underscore and a quick grep reveals a lot of ste, and some tegra
and vexpress compatibles using underscore as well.

A generic binding would certainly be useful.

=46rom what I can see TI are using: -

    ti,pm-firmware in wkup_m3_rproc.c

and Freescale are using: -

fsl,sdma-ram-script-name in imx-sdma.c

So other platforms are putting it in device tree, there are probably ot=
her
examples.

Most other STi drivers keep the firmware name in the C code, which is
usually my first preference. However with fdma it is more comlicated
as there is a seperate firmware file for each instance of the IP block.

I will see if there is a way to remove this from DT and keep it in
the driver.
