Having a library module usually requires less code, and is more consistent
with other drivers, which helps new developers understand what the
driver is doing.

The most important aspect though is the DT binding: once the structure
with separate kernel drivers leaks out into the DT format, you can't
easily change the driver any more, e.g. to make a property that was
introduced for one glue driver more general so it can get handled by
the common part. Having a single node lets us convert to the library
model later, so that would be a strong reason to keep the DT binding
simple, without child nodes.

Following that logic, it turns into another reason for using the library
model to start with, because otherwise the child device does not have
any DT properties itself and has to rely on the parent device properties,
which somewhat complicates the driver structure.

No, you are absolutely right with that, introducing the generic glue
driver is orthogonal to the structure of the core driver in principle.

I mainly brought it up because I noticed how this patch could be done
in a simpler way by combining the new generic glue with the move to
a library driver model.
