Hi Uwe,

Will do that. But it would be good we end up w/ a solution for current
in-tree users of the driver, i.e. those w/ a need for the second
patch ;-)

I handled that in details in the documentation (w/ a typo I will fix, I
must confess). The answer is: if you put a "can-wakeup-machine" propert=
y
in your .dts for ISL12057, then it means IRQ#2 can wake up the machine
BUT is not hooked up to the SoC. And only that. Alarm2 is not supported
(it can generate an interrupt on IRQ#1 or IRQ#2) so the driver does not
deal w/ IRQ#1 at all.

That being said, one can still add support later for Alarm2 (via IRQ#1
or IRQ#2) and the "can-wakeup-machine" property you proposed will still
handle that w/o issue.

As a side note, on our ReadyNAS, we can easily test a support for alarm=
2
on IRQ#2 pin. But In the end, the main problem will still be core rtc
interface: how do you handle the existence of two alarms on a RTC chip
using current sysfs interface, for instance?

I agree you had a good idea in the first place not to force the rtc as
wakeup source and make that configurable via the .dts based on specific
system setup. But I think we should keep the knob simple.

What you propose is probably more accurate w/ the existence of a PMIC
in the device but IMHO the main purpose of the property is to tell the
driver that IRQ#2 (associated w/ the alarm1 it supports) can wake the
machine up. It would be more complex than needed for the driver to try
and understand that in fact the controller and irq that are passed are
placebo and it should the declare the device as a wakeup source.

What about changing the property name from "can-wakeup-machine" to
"isil,irq2-can-wakeup-machine" instead? It makes it clear that it is
specific to that driver, and that it only works w/ IRQ#2.

Will drop thoses changes.
