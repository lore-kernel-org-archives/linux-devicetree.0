dtbTool is unfortunately broken if it can't handle unknown compatibles.

Which means that everyone will, just like in Android-land, ship their
products with the one-and-only-supported qcom,apq8096-sbc.

If at least dtbTool would skip (and potentially warn about) unknown
entries vendors could add their specific name and then have the sbc
compatible, allowing for compatibility while dtbTool is updated.

In Android land you don't have this problem, you know which zImage and
which set of dtbs you should put into your boot.img. So based on above
problem (requirement to update dtbTool) and the lack of need companies
will continue to ship their products as "mtp" or "sbc".
