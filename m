While I'll be the first to agree with that, there's also a great deal
of empirical evidence to suggest that they get it right enough often
enough.  Otherwise nothing would boot and everything would be broken.

: Indeed.  In fact, the general rule of thumb is really "put as much as
: possible into the most easily replaced layer of the stack".  This is,
: incidentally, why I've always been dubious about simple firmwares
: supplying a flattened device tree rather than including the device

The down side of cuboot style is that your kernel will boot on fewer
boards.  The firmware enables more generic kernels.

: A good analysis.  The other side of this, is that for an OS, if you
: rely on the firmware to do X, it will work when the firmware gets it
: right.  If you do X yourself, it will work whether or not the firmware
: gets it right.  This means that if there's even one firmware you have

: and then there is little to no incentive to rely on firmware even in
: the cases where it does get it right.  In fact there's a disincentive,
: because then you have two different code paths to test and maintain.

Two comments: (1) You are assuming that you are in a position to do
'X' right which isn't always possible (in this case, it is impossible
to do generically, but can be done specifically for a given board if
you know enough about the board) and (2) In this case, the wrapped fdt
path uses the same path as the get the fdt from the firmware.
