LS1012A features an advanced 64-bit ARM v8 CortexA53 processor
with 32 KB of parity protected L1-I cache, 32 KB of ECC protected
L1-D cache, as well as 256 KB of ECC protected L2 cache.

Features summary
 One 64-bit ARM-v8 Cortex-A53 core with the following capabilities
  - Arranged as a cluster of one core supporting a 256 KB L2 cache with ECC
    protection
  - Speed up to 800 MHz
  - Parity-protected 32 KB L1 instruction cache and 32 KB L1 data cache
  - Neon SIMD engine
  - ARM v8 cryptography extensions
 One 16-bit DDR3L SDRAM memory controller
 ARM core-link CCI-400 cache coherent interconnect
 Cryptography acceleration (SEC)
 One Configurable x3 SerDes
 One PCI Express Gen2 controller, supporting x1 operation
 One serial ATA (SATA Gen 3.0) controller
 One USB 3.0/2.0 controller with integrated PHY

 Following levels of DTSI/DTS files have been created for the LS1012A
   SoC family:

           - fsl-ls1012a.dtsi:
                   DTS-Include file for FSL LS1012A SoC.

           - fsl-ls1012a-frdm.dts:
                   DTS file for FSL LS1012A FRDM board.

           - fsl-ls1012a-qds.dts:
                   DTS file for FSL LS1012A QDS board.

           - fsl-ls1012a-rdb.dts:
                    DTS file for FSL LS1012A RDB board.

Changes in v4: Incorporated Shawn's comments
- Convert "regulator_3p3v: regulator" to "reg_3p3v: regulator-3p3v"
- Add "status = "disabled"" property in sata and duart nodes

Changes in v3: Incorporated Leo's comments
- Change PPI interrupts to IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW and
- SPI interrupts to IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH

Changes in v2: Incorporated Shawn's comments
- Brief introduction of the SoC in commit message
- Alphabetic ordering of labeled nodes
- Better naming to be used for regulator node
- Make timer node's comments more readable
- Sort nodes with unit-address in order of the address
