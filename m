Depending on how closely it resembles a previously supported SoC, the
changes might be minimal.

DTC recently grew the ability to do overlay trees, which in combination
with include files lets you factor out the SoC stuff into its own file.

For example, see arch/powerpc/boot/dts/p4080si.dtsi and
arch/powerpc/boot/dts/p4080ds.dts

You can still use the SOC version info.  You could also encode whatever
information is relevant into the device's compatible string, or other
properties.

On Freescale powerpc boards we usually patch up things like this from
U-Boot, though this has some drawbacks.  It could also be done from
early Linux platform code, or some update program that sits between
firmware and Linux (such as a U-Boot standalone application).  We use
these updates for board-level things as well, such as when certain
devices are enabled/disabled by jumper or similar config.

It's also possible to have the driver just find out about the SOC
revision from elsewhere, though this can be awkward in a virtualized
environment if you need to mix emulated devices that belong to different
SOC types.

The FDT is not a driver configuration medium.  It is supposed to just
describe the hardware.

In general, if you're relying on a binding that hasn't been accepted
into mainline Linux (or possibly some other designated binding
repository, such as devicetree.org), you're at risk of breakage.  Same
as with other APIs.

You can usually have the code support both the new and old bindings, though.

On powerpc we still have board code (identified by string, not
enumeration).  Even if we eventually develop the ability to boot on an
unrecognized board purely based on the other things in the device tree
(provided all the needed support is actually there), the ability to
match the toplevel compatible when special handling is needed would
still be there.

How is this different from powerpc?

This can also be said of powerpc.

Why have such a rigid structure at all, versus just having various bits
of code that support various things, glued together however the device
tree and/or board code specify?
