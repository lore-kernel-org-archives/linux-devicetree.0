I'd rather suspect you'll find there are actually specs for these things
but they're hidden in the electrical characteristics which don't tend to
go into the published datasheets (though ).  Not useful if we don't
actually see them though.

These are the traditional approaches, pioneered by essentially every
existing cpufreq driver (well, "make up" is a bit harsh - usually the
numbers are measured, though possibly only on a limited set of systems).

This would be nice, in both the clock and cpufreq code (the cpufreq code
is pretty limited here in that it assumes an equal transition latency
for all transitions which isn't the case usually).  You can generally do
something useful with measurement, probably we can arrange to measure
the times we're seeing on the actua system or something.
