Agree.

I would leave alone pins which are unused on the board. Most likely the
SPI pins are being send to audio connector for codec control over SPI.

Agree.

You lost me here. I guess I will benefit from a code snippet to
illustrate the intention.

Agree. That would be better and more modern.

ok.

I do agree its easier to read if offsets directly matches addresses
specified in the technical reference manual than doing the math with
offsets and making sure they are correct.

That said, I am not sure null range translation is really the preferred
approach. I would go with what DT maintainers say here.

It would be nice if you could fixup mcasp0_pins in da850-evm.dts. Surely
it is doing more than what is needed.
