Okay. If it can be expected that the codec driver will call these then
the references will not be required in the card driver for the codecs.

The i2s out controller also uses i2s_mclk, and calls clk_set_rate in
hw_params at present. Would creating a set_sysclk callback for the i2s
out controller, then calling snd_soc_dai_set_sysclk on the cpu dai in
addition to the codec dais in the card driver be the correct way to
manage this?
