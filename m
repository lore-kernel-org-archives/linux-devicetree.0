The patch

   dt-bindings: sound: sun4i-i2s: Document that the RX channel can be missing

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git for-5.3

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: sound: sun4i-i2s: Document that the RX channel
 can be missing

The A83t and compatibles controllers don't have any reception capabilities
on some instances of the controllers, even though it was never documented
as such in the binding before.

Therefore, on those controllers, we don't have the option to set an RX DMA
channel.

This was already done in the DTSI, but the binding itself was never
updated. Let's add a special case in the schemas.
