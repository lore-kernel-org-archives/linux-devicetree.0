Hopefully we can make a connector binding that can
be used in any way by the OS: either probe a board
populating driver (such as in this patch set) or allow
an overlay to be inserted (the aforementioned driver
compiled out or inactive) further down the road. I would
like to believe the board population problem is a
both/and thing, not an either/or thing here.

Could be a simple as a compatible-string for the
connector(s). We just keep it dirt simple.

I tested that actually, using the connector as nexus. It works
fine. The problem I ran into was more practical
(see below).

I have that working today, I just didn't go beyond that.

It's because of usability issues. (Described below.)

I didn't even do that. I just patched the DTS with a connector
and booted it.

>From a user point of view whether having a
patched up DTS or a boot loader modifying the DTB at
run-time does not really matter as these boards are
non-discoverable anyway. The boot loader will now know
if they are there or not. What should the user do? Should
they send command line arguments to U-Boot to say that
we have the secure96 board? Flash different boot loaders
depending on what board(s) are connected? That is even
more awkward (IMO) than just modifying and redeploying
the DTB.

The bright side of this patch set is that the user boots
and the kernel is aware of there being a connector
and presents sysfs files to populate the boards.

User goes "hm OK I have a secure96":
cd /sys/bus/platform/devices/connector
echo 1 > secure96

And there it populates.

No special boot loaders. No special tools.

And that is where the user (also me) stops short.

Now I want to plug this board. OK download device tree
compiler, author a fragment, compile it, compile a
special userspace for inserting it into the right node,
flash filesystem with that new userpace tool, also
do not forget the DTB fragment, parameterize that
tool to load the fragment into the connector node.
Maybe the user need to change stuff on the fly?
Hm then they need a text editor and a DT compiler
on the target too, OK things like that can be done.

Admittedly the above is more versatile. Probably
awesome when you need to populate a device forest
on an FPGA.

But is that even a realistic usecase? And what about
the average plug-in board user? If they can do the
population by compiling a kernel driver for their
board and say it's there and populate it with a simple
echo into a sysfs file they will be happy.

It doesn't exclude (IMHO if done right) the possibility for a
more complex device tree fragment approach to
be substituted for this later, if it is better for the user.
They just stop to compile in that kernel module for
populating the board, or do not use the sysfs file.

IMO it is way better than "stop everything and fix
fragments first". It's a stopgap thing, if overlays
materialize later.
