I'd prefer not to do that for my platforms, for the reason Shawn points
out in his reply to yours.

However, I believe the bindings I proposed are flexible enough to allow
you to do exactly this for your platforms without requiring that everyone
do it.

Recall my proposal was:

pmx_sdhci_standby: pinctrl@0 {
    /* Format is <&pmx_controller_phandle muxable_entity_id
     * selected_function>.
     */
    mux =
        <&tegra_pmx TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTA TEGRA_PMX_MUX_1>
        <&tegra_pmx TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTD TEGRA_PMX_MUX_1>;
    config =
        <&tegra_pmx TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTA TEGRA_PMX_CONF_TRISTATE 1>
        <&tegra_pmx TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTD TEGRA_PMX_CONF_TRISTATE 1>
        <&tegra_pmx TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTA TEGRA_PMX_CONF_DRIVE_STRENGTH 5>
        <&tegra_pmx TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTD TEGRA_PMX_CONF_DRIVE_STRENGTH 5>
        <&tegra_pmx TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTA TEGRA_PMX_CONF_SLEW_RATE 4>
        <&tegra_pmx TEGRA_PMX_PG_DTD TEGRA_PMX_CONF_SLEW_RATE 8>;
};

(Note that I think we've agreed to remove the first cell above, &tegra_pmx,
now by requiring such nodes exist as children of the pin controller.)

My assertion is that the common pinmux bindings define that the
Interpretation of muxable_entity_id is left up to the binding of the
specific pin controller. Hence, I can says "it's an integer, and here
is the list of valid values and what they mean", and you can say "it's
a phandle, which must refer to one of the per-pin nodes defined by the
pin controller".

Does that work for you?
