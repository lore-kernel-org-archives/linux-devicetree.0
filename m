O.K, so this definitely needs documenting somewhere, since it is not
obvious. I'm not sure if it is sufficient to make this part of the
commit log, or if it should be documented in Documentation/power.

Is it a binary blob in the uboot source tree?

It also makes mainline suspend/resume dependent on Marvell not
changing the bootloader.
