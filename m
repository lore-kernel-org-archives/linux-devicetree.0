Shawn,

Thanks for the review. I will incorporate all of your comments in a v2
but do have a few points worth discussion below

I haven't moved to simple-panel yet because I have bootloader code
that allows choosing/altering display timings with the goal being
users don't need to recompile their device-tree or kernel to use a
display with different timings. It seems to me that moving to
simple-panel would make this even more difficult as while the
bootloader could find and alter the panel's compatible property (in
the case the kernel has a supported simple-panel compiled in) it no
longer has access to the raw timings (in case the kernel doesn't have
a simple-panel driver built-in already).

I do like the way simple-panel combines display timings with
backlight, power supplies, dc bus, and a gpio enable but it doesn't
encapsulate touch controller or expose timings to device-tree for easy
manipulation.

What are you thoughts on this?

This is because I have a bootloader configuration that allows the user
to choose between GPIO and PWM for the non-backlight PWM pins. I
should probably add a comment to those nodes specifying that firmware
modifies the status property.

Thanks,

Tim
