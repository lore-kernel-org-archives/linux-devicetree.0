OK, how about this:

		mrml-bridge0@1,0 {

					sgmii00: sgmii00 {
						reg = <0> ;
						compatible = "marvell,88e1240", "ethernet-phy-ieee802.3-c22";
					};
				};
			};
			bgx0 {
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				};

			};

		};


The "msi-map" is specified in the PICe host controller node, but there
is a bridge between the device generating interrupts "bgx0" and the
host controller.

Good, I will incorporate that too.

In practice, I don't know if we would ever find a system with multiple 
"msi-map" on a path from the device to the root, but we should probably 
attempt to handle it "just in case".
