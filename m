Hi Ben,

Agreed that there is room for improvement.   I intend to look further 
into your suggestions from here and our private conversation on the 
matter and make changes as appropriate.  I have an open issue to track 
this.  As it exists in this patch reads/writes from master to slave 
fundamentally work.   Given the pervasiveness and time to fully evaluate 
and test any protocol updates I intend address this in the near future 
with a separate follow on patch.

Thanks,
Chris
