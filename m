This series enables the video engine on Aspeed BMC platforms. The use of the
video engine reset line, originally planned to be made externally available in
the clock driver, is removed from the video engine driver. A node for the video
engine is added to the AST2500 devicetree.
The series also includes a missing property for reserved memory in the
devicetree documentation, and a small change to make the video engine driver
start without reserved memory.

Changes since v1:
 - Drop clock patch since it's been applied
 - Add a missing semi-colon in the devicetree doc
