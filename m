Hi!

The TSE-850 is an FM Transmitter Station Equipment, designed to generate
baseband signals for FM, mainly the DARC subcarrier, but other signals
are also possible.

This adds a driver for the "sound" bits of the device (quoted since it
is normally not used for normal sound output, but that works too of
course). 

I have not provided a patch to add axentia as a devicetree vendor prefix,
since such a patch is already pending in an IIO series [1] that seems
close to being accepted.

However, there are a couple of points that I'm not 100% satisfied with
for this driver.

First, I do not know how to describe the relays that control if the
IN1/IN2 signals are directly routed towards OUT1/OUT2 or if they are
routed to the "add" switch. The dapm routing treats this as if the
IN1/IN2 signals are always routed to both the "add" switch and to
the muxes feeding OUT1/OUT2. This is fine with me since nothing is
powered in those sections anyway, so what dapm thinks does not really
matter. But it is a wart all the same.

Second, there's my comment in tse850_put_mix() when the "add" switch
is updated. I believe this update should really happen as a side
effect of the call to snd_soc_dapm_mixer_update_power(), so that it
happens at the right point compared to other stuff that is powered.
But I do not know how to hook that up and instead I flip the switch
before the call since it doesn't really matter. I.e., any noise
resulting from this badness is negligeble in practice.

Cheers,
Peter
