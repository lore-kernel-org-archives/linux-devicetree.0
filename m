The compatible string is not specific enough ? I don't see how to specific more.

The MDMA is able to address memories and devices from AHB bus or AXI bus.
The MDMA has a little different way of working to address AHB
device/memory and AXI device/memory.
In STM32H7 platform, almost all devices are addressed by AXI bus.
But we have some memories adress by AHB bus.
So, we add these parameter to be able to handle this.
