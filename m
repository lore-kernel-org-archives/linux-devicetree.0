I see. I would keep the two patchsets separate. I mean that this
patchset should expect that the original handling of %pf is still
there.

The way how to remove or obsolete "%pf" should be handled in
the patchset removing all %pf users or it can be done
in a completely separate patch.

The conflict can get handled when merging the two patchsets.
