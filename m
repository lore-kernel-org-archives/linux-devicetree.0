That situation describes enabling a new feature. New features aren't
necessarily expected to work without revising the DT, e.g. adding new
properties/entries to describe the additional clocks/DMA-channels/...
that are required. In many cases, those additions can even be made in a
backwards-compatible way. Compatibility means that we shouldn't break
old functionality, not that we shouldn't augment the existing bindings.
