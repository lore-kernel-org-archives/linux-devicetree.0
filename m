It is, I believe Andreas commented this for his own reference, I'll drop it.

I beleive this was meant to be be SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS and not
SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS. I'll fix this all up for v3.

Just thinking, the sound core sets SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF before suspend
anyway, right? So the results would be similar just having all the PM
stuff in the bias level handling for consistency, but I'm open to
whatever is the preferred way.
