I have a long series of patches at
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/arnd/playground.git
and I should upload a newer version of that.

The part with !MMU support has to be changed anyway, but you can
get a lot of useful patches from my tree if you look carefully.

We should probably have a Kconfig symbol

config ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM_STRICT
	bool "Allow only configurations that do not break multiplatform support"
	depends on ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM && EXPERT

and then make this mutually exclusive with all options that are known
to break multiplatform: !MMU, CPU_BIG_ENDIAN, DEBUG_LL, XIP_KERNEL,
!AUTO_ZRELADDR, !ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT and a lot of the errata workarounds
that are currently 'depends on !MULTIPLATFORM'.

Also, we currently have a rather complex setup to pick the allowed
CPU architecture levels in arbitrary combinations. Adding in V7M
would make this even more complicated, so I'd rather simplify it first,
and change it into a "minimum architecture level" choice statement,
which in effect isn't all that different to what we have today.

Something like

choice "CPU Core family selection"

config ARCH_MULTI_V4_MIN
	bool "ARMv4 based platforms (FA526)"
	select ARCH_MULTI_V4
	select ARCH_MULTI_V4T
	select ARCH_MULTI_V5

config ARCH_MULTI_V4T_MIN
	bool "ARMv4T based platforms (ARM720T, ARM920T, ...)"
	select ARCH_MULTI_V4T
	select ARCH_MULTI_V5

config ARCH_MULTI_V5_MIN
	bool "ARMv5 based platforms (ARM926T, PJ1, ...)"
	select ARCH_MULTI_V5

config ARCH_MULTI_V6_MIN
	bool "ARMv6 based platforms (ARM1136r0)"
	select ARCH_MULTI_V6
	select ARCH_MULTI_V6K
	select ARCH_MULTI_V7
	select ARCH_MULTI_V7_VE

config ARCH_MULTI_V6K_MIN
	bool "ARMv6K based platforms (ARM1136r1, ARM1176, ARM11MPCORE)"
	select ARCH_MULTI_V6K
	select ARCH_MULTI_V7
	select ARCH_MULTI_V7VE

config ARCH_MULTI_V7_MIN
	bool "ARMv7 based platforms (Cortex-A5/A8/A9, PJ4, Scorpion)"
	select ARCH_MULTI_V7
	select ARCH_MULTI_V7VE

config ARCH_MULTI_V7_VEMIN
	bool "ARMv7VE based platforms (Cortex-A7/A12/A15/A17, Brahma-B15, Krait)"
	select ARCH_MULTI_V7VE

config ARCH_MULTI_V7M
	bool "ARMv7-M based platforms (Cortex-M3/M4/M7)"

endchoice

I'm not sure about the exact symbol names, we should try to minimize the
impact on existing configuration file when doing this.
