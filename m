QMTM stands for queue manager and traffic manager. It is device managing
the hardware queues. It also implements QoS among hardware queues hence
term "traffic" manager is present in its name.

Sure, I will add more info about the device in the next revision.

The primary purpose of QMTM UIO driver is to expose QMTM HW to
user space so that frameworks like ODP (OpenDataPlane) can use
this from user space.

Sure, will do.

I added "uio" in compatible string because in future APM might
add separate driver for accessing QMTM from kernel space.

Can you suggest better compatible strings for this UIO driver?

Ok, I will remove it from reg and add "qpool-addr" and "qpool-size"
attributes to
point the location of qpool.

For faster access, this can be on-chip memory as well.

reserved-memory only apply to RAM, it does not apply to on-chip
SRAMs. Right ?

Yes.

Sure, will rename it in next revision.

When there are multiple QMTM devices, the devid is used to form a
unique id (a tuple of queue number and device id) for the queues
belonging to this device. Unfortunately, we don't have any register
providing the devid of the device.
