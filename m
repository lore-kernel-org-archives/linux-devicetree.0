I can confirm seeing this issue on the Bananapi M1+. On my Cubietruck
I'm seeing another issue. The OOB interrupt fires excessively, like
it was not properly acked. Dropping OOB and using SDIO interrupt
make it work normally. Disabling mmc runtime pm either by adding
pm_runtime_get_sync or by reverting all the related patches does not
help.

I don't quite remember when it was working properly though, since I
only noticed the issue this past week when I saw the LEDs lit up all
the time while rearranging things. Normally the LEDs are out of my
field of view.

On a separate topic, do you know of anyone that has gotten the serdev
bluetooth code to work with the AMPAK chips? Maxime tried when the
serdev code was first merged, and I tried last week. The bluetooth
part comes up with the hci interface looking normal and everything,
but it can't find any other devices. Scan commands give an error:

    Bluetooth: hci0: last event is not cmd complete (0x0f)

Thanks
