Cool, thanks. Agreed, but I thought it'd be nice to list the simulator class.

This isn't particularly scientific, but maybe a practical criteria could be
that it's mentioned in this thread? I think if we word the introduction to the
list clearly, readers will know that that these are just a few examples known
to be in use when the binding was written and by no means required. I think
that providing more information is more likely to fix the incorrect assumption
than providing less information.

Yes, I assumed you would include Xen. I'm not aware of any others*, but
perhaps those who do could speak up about them?

(*I do use Angel semihosting and DCC from time to time, but I've never seen
devicetree bindings for these facilities. I'm not sure whether they count in
this context.)

Thanks,
Christopher
