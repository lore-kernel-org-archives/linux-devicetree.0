I guess we can, but that case is already covered by the above tests.

If the single action was not IRQF_NO_SUSPEND, then
desc->no_suspend_depth == 0, and we return early.

If the single action was IRQF_NO_SUSPEND, then 
desc->no_suspend_depth == desc->nr_actions, and we return early.

We could change the second test to:
if (desc->nr_actions == 1 || desc->nr_actions == desc->no_suspend_depth)

...but I don't see that we gain much by doing so.

Sorry, you are correct.

To keep things easy to reason about, let's leave this as-is for now. If
we encounter a performance problem we can see about optimizing.

Thanks,
Mark.
