Not arguing that, and I totally see that those cases indeed require a
new compatible string.

But that is only compared to the original A23/A31 model? AFAICT compared
to the H3 DMA it's really only the number of supported DMA channels that
has changed. For which we don't even need to invent a property name.
My point was that as the driver is *at the moment* all those different
compatible strings behaved the same (apart from the missing A23 clock
gating), see commits f008db8c00c1 and 3a03ea763a67. The differences we
coded in struct sun6i_dma_config were more or less artificial.
Now thanks to Stefan we learned that the H3 is more different than we
thought, so this argument doesn't hold anymore (but see below).

I agree on that.

What I am after is to cover SoCs which *don't* have differences in their
register layout, for instance A83T, H3, A64, R40.
In an ideal world we could have reused the H3 compatible string,
adjusting the number of channels for each SoC in the DT.

So I see that having a generic compatible name will not fly, as we now
have differences which should not be modelled by DT properties.
But I still think we should try to cover those non-register differences
(number of channels) with a DT property, to allow reusing the existing
driver code whenever possible. As is stands with this series, the R40
support should just be a matter of:
	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-r40-dma",
		     "allwinner,sun50i-a64-dma";

I am aware that future SoCs might require new compatibles (I actually
hope that they introduce 64-bit memory addresses at some point), but
having the "dma-channels" DT parsing code in should then reduce the
frequency of driver changes (for SoCs just copying existing DMA IP).

Cheers,
Andre.
