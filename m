Maybe we need some advice here :)


I've used clk_prepare_enable() 'just' to get the enable count incremented

http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/drivers/clk/clk.c#L751

Because it's my understanding that enable_count is needed to prevent 
clk_disable_unused() from disabling the clock.


If there is an other / better / correct way to achieve that, please let 
us know.


I've had a look to use the CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED flag, too. But couldn't 
find a function exported by the clock framework to set that flag (?)


Best regards

Dirk
