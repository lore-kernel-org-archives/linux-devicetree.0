Hm, it's in patch 1/2 (just dropped the cover letter, which might not
be such a good idea).

Well, it's not only describing timings (see atmel,bus-width,
atmel,byte-access-type, ...), but I'm fine with either names :).

Okay. Mark, what do you think of this approach?

Note that one of my previous version was defining timings directly in
the EBI device node, and Arnd noted that doing so may cause problems
if one of the EBI property (or the config/timing node name) conflict
with the sub-device binding, which is why I decided to put the EBI
config definitions in a separate subnode.

Well, another reason I switched to a string property is because I
implemented hardware readout in v4, and decided to retrieve the current
state from the hardware and only overload the config with what was
defined in the DT. In this case, if we move to a boolean property we
can't know whether the property is missing because we want to put the
bus in "normal" mode or because we want to keep this config unchanged
(keep the bootloader/bootstrap config).

This is not true in v5, so maybe we should go back to the boolean
atmel,tdf-optimized property.

Thanks,

Boris
