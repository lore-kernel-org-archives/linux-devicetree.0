Add optional local-bd-address property which is a 6-byte array
storing the assigned BD address. Since having a unique BD address
is critical, a per-device property value should be allocated.
This property is usually added by the boot loader which has access
to the provisioned data.

 v2: Set device as unconfigured if default address detected
     Add warning if BD addr retrieved from DT
 v3: if no addr retrieved from DT, unconditionally set
     the invalid BD addr flag.
     swap and set bdaddr in the platform probe
 v4: Add dt-bindings documentation
     split patch in two parts (setup, dt prop)
     use local-bd-address name instead of local-mac-address
