Ah right, I understand. So if we run the turn-on diagnostics routine, there's
nothing stopping anyone from interacting with the device in other ways.

I guess there's no way to share that mutex with ALSA? In that case, it doesn't
matter if this mutex is there or not - this feature is incompatible. How
compatible do debugfs interfaces have to be? I was under the impression anything
goes. I would argue that the debugfs is better off for having the mutex so
that no one re-reads "diagnostic" within the 5s poll timeout.

Alternatively, this diagnostic feature could be handled with an external-handler
kcontrol SOC_SINGLE_EXT? I'm not sure if this is an atomic interface either.

What would be acceptable?
