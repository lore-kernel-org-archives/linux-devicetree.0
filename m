 Moreover

Did you read rest of the set, or just the cover-letter?  I referenced
0/0 because it is the thread parent and from there you can drill down
into the commits where I believe there is adequate explanation in
each.  If you could be more specific and tell me which commit you
think requires more explanation, I'd be happy to take a look.

Well that is exactly what we're doing.  Is there an issue with that?

This is a way to do it at a platform level.  It means we can support
multiple platforms where clocksources have been switched around
without writing new driver code in drivers/clk/st.

If you have something else in mind, let me know.

I'm not sure what you mean by this, would you be able to expland a
little?

Please bear in mind that we don't supply our clocks statically.  All
of the information is extracted from DT, so if the always-on
information does reside in there, where do you propose it comes from?

We could just write this code inside our own driver and apply the
CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED at a local level, but that's not the generic
solution I am searching for.
