I mean, something closer to:

static int bcm2835_dma_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
	uint32_t chan_mask;
	// ...

	if (pdev->dev.of_node) {
		rc = of_property_read_u32(..., &chan_mask);
		if (rc) {
			// Error out
		}
	} else {
		// Error message
		return -EINVAL;
	}

	// ...
	// Channel registration loop (independent of any OF functions)
	// ...

	if (pdev->dev.of_node) {
		rc = of_dma_controller_register(...);
		// ...
	}

	// ...
}

Right, you need USB to have ethernet working. Still, IMHO UART (for
console) + ethernet (for file transfer or NFS root) is the reasonable
setup allowing you to debug further drivers in a comfortable way.
