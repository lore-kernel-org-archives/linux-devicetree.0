	Documentation for perf usage and Hisilicon SoC PMU uncore events.
	The Hisilicon SOC has event counters for hardware modules like
	L3 cache, Miscellaneous node, DDR cntroller etc. These events are
	all uncore.

+Hisilicon SoC PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit)
+================================================
+The Hisilicon SoC hip05/06/07 chips consist of varous independent system
+device PMU's such as L3 cache(L3C), Miscellaneous Nodes(MN) and DDR
+controllers. These PMU devices are independent and have hardware logic to
+gather statistics and performance information.
+
+Hip0x chips are encapsulated by multiple CPU and IO die's. The CPU die is
+called as Super CPU cluster (SCCL) which includes 16 cpu-cores. Every SCCL
+is further grouped as CPU clusters (CCL) which includes 4 cpu-cores each.
+Each SCCL has 1 L3 cache and 1 MN units.
+
+The L3 cache is shared by all CPU cores in a CPU die. The L3C has four banks
+(or instances). Each bank or instance of L3C has Eight 32-bit counter
+registers. The hip05/06 chip L3 cache has 22 statistics events. The hip07
+chip has 66 statistics events. These events are very useful for debugging.
+
+The MN module is also shared by all CPU cores in a CPU die. It receives
+barriers and DVM(Distributed Virtual Memory) messages from cpu or smmu, and
+perform the required actions and return response messages. These events are
+very useful for debugging. The MN has total 9 statistics events and support
+four 32-bit counter registers in hip05/06/07 chips.
+
+The DDR conroller supports various statistics events. Every SCCL has fot 2
+DDR channels and hence 2 DDR controllers. The Hip05/06/07 has support for a
+total of 13 statistics events.
+
+There is no memory mapping for L3 cache and MN registers. It can be accessed
+by using the Hisilicon djtag interface. The Djtag in a SCCL is an independent
+module which connects with some modules in the SoC by Debug Bus.
+
+Hisilicon SoC (hip05/06/07) PMU driver
+--------------------------------------
+The hip0x PMU driver shall register perf PMU drivers like L3 cache, MN, DDRC
+etc.
+Separate PMU shall be registered for L3 cache and MN for each Super CPU
+cluster.
+For DRR controller separate PMU shall be registered for each channel in a
+Super CPU cluster.
+
+The available events and configuration options shall be described in the sysfs.
+The "perf list" shall list the available events from sysfs.
+eg. hisi_l3c2/read_allocate/ [kernel PMU event]
+
+The Super Cluster ID will be the number suffix to PMU name
+e.g. hisi_l3c2. Here Super cluster ID is 2 and so hisi_l3c2/read_allocate
+is the event for read_allocate of SCCL #2.
+
+For DDRC the channel number will be suffix at the end.
+eg: hisi_ddrc2_0/flux_read/. Here Super cluster ID is 2 and the channel number
+is 0 for the event flux_read.
+
+The event code is represented by 12 bits.
+	i) event 0-11
+		The event code will be represented using the LSB 12 bits.
+
+The driver also provides a "cpumask" sysfs attribute, which shows the CPU core
+ID used to count the uncore PMU event.
+
+Example usage of perf:
+$# perf list
+hisi_l3c2/read_hit/ [kernel PMU event]
+hisi_l3c2/write_hit/ [kernel PMU event]
+------------------------------------------
+hisi_l3c1/read_hit/ [kernel PMU event]
+hisi_l3c1/write_hit/ [kernel PMU event]
+------------------------------------------
+hisi_mn2/read_req/ [kernel PMU event]
+hisi_mn2/write_req/ [kernel PMU event]
+------------------------------------------
+hisi_ddrc2_0/flux_read/ [kernel PMU event]
+------------------------------------------
+
+$# perf stat -a -e hisi_l3c2/read_allocate/ sleep 5
+
+The current driver doesnot support sampling. so "perf record" is unsupported.
+Also attach to a task is unsupported as the events are all uncore.
+
+Note: Please contact the maintainer for a complete list of events supported for
+the PMU devices in the SoC and its information if needed.
