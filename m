There are two kernel config symbols influencing this:

config AUTO_ZRELADDR
        bool "Auto calculation of the decompressed kernel image address"
        depends on !ZBOOT_ROM && !ARCH_U300
        help
          ZRELADDR is the physical address where the decompressed kernel
          image will be placed. If AUTO_ZRELADDR is selected, the address
          will be determined at run-time by masking the current IP with
          0xf8000000. This assumes the zImage being placed in the first 128MB
          from start of memory.

config ARM_PATCH_PHYS_VIRT
        bool "Patch physical to virtual translations at runtime" if EMBEDDED
        default y
        depends on !XIP_KERNEL && MMU
        depends on !ARCH_REALVIEW || !SPARSEMEM
        help
          Patch phys-to-virt and virt-to-phys translation functions at
          boot and module load time according to the position of the
          kernel in system memory.

          This can only be used with non-XIP MMU kernels where the base
          of physical memory is at a 16MB boundary.

          Only disable this option if you know that you do not require
          this feature (eg, building a kernel for a single machine) and
          you need to shrink the kernel to the minimal size.

Of course, the kernel must be loaded at some address within the provided 
RAM information in DT as well.  If you cannot meet those restrictions 
then the corresponding features have to be disabled in your build.
