Not the IP, but register access. SET and CLR type registers work on
individual bits because the processors don't share a lock that
protects register read->modify->write.

Usually there is also some flag that is set to some unique value to
claim ownership of the resource, and if two processors try to claim
simultaneously we need to check if the flag reads back the value we
set to assert claim. There should be some such flag/register but as I
said I don't know if/which. Is there?

API calls send_data() only if last_tx_done() returned true.

API internally does any needed reset.

Platform_data usually carries board/platform specific parameters.
Register offset "properties" are as fixed as the behavior of the
controller, so they should stay inside the code, not come via
platform_data.
