I am also leaning toward this solution. Probably moving the
mux handling to a separate file and Kconfig symbol with some
header stubs that get compiled out unless explicitly enabled.

Yeah that is the big hammer. This is what we did for IRQ line
muxes in drivers/irqchip/irq-crossbar.c, but maybe it's overkill.

The main requirement is telling which master to use for each
channel, really, I can do without the naming (though it is very helpful
for debugging).

I don't know how to provide a specifier for eligible bus interfaces
in some elegant way with the DMA specifier, I could of course use
two cells containing a plain number, specifying 0 for any interface,
1 for ahb1 and 2 for ahb2 like that:

#define BUS_AHB_ANY 0
#define BUS_AHB1 1
#define BUS_AHB2 2

uart1: uart@101fb000 {
        compatible = "arm,pl011", "arm,primecell";
        (...)
        dmas = <&dmac1 22 BUS_AHB1>,
               <&dmac1 23 BUS_AHB1>;
        dma-names = "rx", "tx";
};

The problem is that this is just so wrong: the bus master arbitration
is a property of the DMA controller, not the consuming device. The DMA
controller side is where the lines to the external buses are connected,
and it is performing the work on behalf of the device.

This way the knowledge is put in the totally wrong place. People get
the impression that this is a property of the consumer...

When it comes to the actual DMA signal line that is more natural to
have in the specifier.
