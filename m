I'll add more comments.

Yes, they must be included in GPIO range node. But if GPIO feature
isn't supported in the pinctrl device, pinctrl-single,gpio is still optional.
I'll add more comments on this.

pinctrl-single,gpio-func is optional for above reason.

GPIO function is enabled by setting proper field in mux field of pinmux
register.

Whatever it's pin ID or offset of pinmux register, they're nearly same.
We can calculate offset from pin ID, vice visa. If pin ID is more acceptable
by you and Tony, I can change it later.

I believe general pinconf can't support all cases in different silicons.
And we still have some common features that could be covered in general
pinconf. So we need a structure to support both pinconf & specific pinconf.

Yes, this part should be included in the previous patch. I'll fix it.
