Thanks for the review!

One note is that I have since come to find that it might not be so
wise to define the sleep pinctrl state here.  For the SPI driver at
least I dug in and I saw the the sleep state is selected when we're
runtime PMed.  ...and with the currently posted SPI driver that can
happen in some cases even when the chip select is supposed to be kept
low.  For now it's more prudent to keep the "sleep" state out of the
device tree and we can always add it in later.

I'll plan to re-spin the patch on Wednesday (I'm unavailable tomorrow).

For other's reference: I chatted offline with Bjorn offline and this
sounded fine to him.
