"Unique ID of the SOC" doesn't this mean that its a part of soc hw 
description/configuration/setup?

Am still not clear why this setup any different to other use cases like 
mac address/calibration data?

I still feel that this should be described in the DT.

Rob,
  What do you think?

IMHO, We should indeed describe the SOC hardware and its relationship 
w.r.t to nvmem provider in device tree. Reasoning being these both are 
some form of IP blocks/hw which depend on each other.

I did read this, I was not convinced that we should do a direct lookup 
for nvmem cells.
