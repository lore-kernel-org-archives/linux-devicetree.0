Ok, I understand.

So maybe we should revive this direction then?

Interesting. I admit I never had a look how the IRQ ->xlate() stuff was
hooked into the OF code, maybe it's a good starting point. This
discussion is on the DT mailing list, so maybe some DT person will
agree to let us know what they think the good approach is?

Right.

Indeed.

So ARM isn't a "normal DT use case" ? :-)
