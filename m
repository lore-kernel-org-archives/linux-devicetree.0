So I have two points here.

=46irst point; I think you're looking at an older version of my set.
The newer one can be found at [1] and no longer uses 'always-on'
nodes.  Instead the 'clk-always-on' property is applied to the
provider.  See the documentation patch [2] for more details.

Second point; this binding is _not_ to be used as a hack because the
hardware isn't understood.  Genuine uses are for clocks that must not
be turned off ever, else bad things will happen.  If the hardware is
not understood, use 'clk-disable-unused' on the kernel cmdline
instead.

The whole point of this set is to manage clocks that can't be power
managed.  Using the 'clk-always-on' property labels the clock with a
big-red-sign saying "DO NOT TURN ME OFF, OR RISK CATASTROPHIC
=46AILURE", not a "TODO: Fix-me when you understand me".

In our case the devices these clocks control will never be added to
Device Tree.  Linux can't see them, they have no registers and they
can't be controlled.  Added a device driver for all such devices would
be foolhardy.

No, this binding is _not_ for that use-case.  If your platform is
incomplete you must use 'clk-disable-unused'. =20

If this clock should _genuinely_ be always-on, then use my new
binding in the clock controller node and the Clk framework will not
turn it off.

I did this in the very first iteration of this set.  The DT guys
didn't like it, which is why I re-wrote it to look like [1].

My ears burning eh?  Do tell...

I think you currently misunderstand the use-case for this set.  I hope
my points above will clarify the point somewhat.  Once we write the
bindings and the DT nodes in [1], I don't plan for them to be changed,
thus our DT will stay stable in this regard.

NB: Yes, we are quite fortunate by the fact that most of are bindings
can be considered fairly transient, but that is irrelevant in this
particular case.
