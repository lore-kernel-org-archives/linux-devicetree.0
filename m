Correct, that is absolutely a conscious (or not) assumption about the
platforms being discussed here, and therefore the proposed patches.

Your point of view is absolutely valid, but does not necessarily match
the reality of things as implemented in real life because:

- the trusted firmware on some platforms is something that is subject to
a different process than a kernel or user-space upgrade and/or
security/certification process, and may be challenging to update in the
future, so people design it with everything they will ever need: PSCI
v0.2 services and that's it

- there is what ARM Ltd. provides as guidelines about how a platform
should be done (read: must, should?), and there is how implementors end
up making (most often uneducated, biased and under time pressure) design
decisions about how a platform will be designed, and prototype is as
close as you could get to a product in the embedded space

That being said, it is definitively something that should be done, so
we'll make sure this gets funneled back to the appropriate people so
they can think about adding SError handling where it should be done.

Thanks for the feedback!
