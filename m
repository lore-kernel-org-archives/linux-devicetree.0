I think I'll remove it instead. The device ships with a U-Boot and Android
installation where blue means "on" and red means "stand-by" (which is simply
implemented by blanking the screen, it seems), but I doubt many people want
to run the rather old Android version available for this device. Instead,
I was going to point to the quick setup guide, but it has no mention of the
LEDs at all, so I guess the user won't expect the blue LED to turn on.

The comment is misleading as the connector is not an OTG one but just a
standard-A receptacle wired to the SoC's OTG port. I'll change the comment.

The MMC core, without broken-cd, requests the GPIO driver to enable
interrupt delivery on the pin and will fall back to polling the GPIO pin
if the GPIO driver refuses to enable interrupt delivery. What I see is
that the GPIO driver accepts to deliver interrupts, but only the first
interrupt is triggered (as evident from /proc/interrupts showing only 1).
The vendor sys_config.fex also sets the GPIO pin to polled operation, so
maybe there is a hardware bug.

The sunxi-mmc driver doesn't really support operation with broken-cd only
because it spams the console and dmesg with useless error messages, see
https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-sunxi@googlegroups.com/msg19963.html
for an example.

The comment should probably read something like "GPIO pin delivers no
interrupts, poll it".

Ack.

I'm verbose with the names of the regulators for documentation purposes
because unlike some of the boards aimed at developers, documentation is on
this device is scarse. I see that with -mmc now added after my latest round
of probing with a multimeter, the line went above 80 characters. Will it be
OK with vcc-pb,c,d,e,f,h-mmc-spdif?
