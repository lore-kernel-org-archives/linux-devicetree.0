I thought you've agreed to not write generic MU(mailbox) driver for SCU.
https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg650217.html
But seems it's still not quite certain...

I'd like to explain some more.

1) the interrupt mechanism is not quite suitable for SCU firmware protocol
as the transfer size would be more than 4 words and the response data size
is also undetermined (it's set by SCU firmware side during a response).
So polling mode may be the best way to handle this as MU message
handling usually is quite fast in a few microseconds.

2) It's true that Mailbox framework is well designed and powerful.
But it's not quite suitable for SCU MU as we don't need to use the most
bits of it. Mailbox seems like to be more suitable for a generic MU
mailbox driver used by various clients/servers.  But SCU MU are
quite specific to SCU protocol and can't be used by other clients
(MU 0~4 is fixed for SCU communication in MX8 HW design). 
Even we write a MU Mailbox driver for SCU MU, it's still not a general
one and can't be used by others (e.g. communication with M4).
So I'd believe the current library way is still the best approach for SCU MU
Using. But I'm also okay for another generic MU drivers for other common
communications between A core and M4 side.

3) We actually have tried the MU(Mailbox) internally, it increased a lot
complexity comparing to the current library way and got a booting time
regression issue due to extra delays introduced in handling SCU protocol
in mailbox way.

And finally a nature question to us is: 
What the benefit we can get for SCU MU using a mailbox way?

If we can't find benefits but introduce more complexities then why
we would do that way?

Dong Aisheng
