You patch would hit the same issues I believe.

Not that I'm aware of. It appeared to be the serial driver. It may be
evident looking at the sparc serial driver match table.

My position has been we should change the driver ordering, but others
have disagreed.

Scott had some issues with my patch and my assumptions may not be
right. Probably re-applying the original patch plus Scott's fix is the
right answer. We just need to review the combined change closely to
ensure we maintain current behavior where needed.
