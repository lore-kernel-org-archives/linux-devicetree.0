The current VDMA driver that got merged in the open source and the  current patch (dma: xilinx dma v4) Srikanth T submitted both contains the
Similar implementation that you pointed as above(I mean similar to the free scale dma driver).

The discussion starts here is why we need the header file(Xilinx_dma.h) in the include/linux/amba/Xilinx_dma.h  folder.

Like for FSL DMA it is got defined (fsl_dma_external_start) as a function prototype in include/linux/fsldma.h
And it is being getting used in the drivers/misc/carma/carma-fpga-program.c

Similarly in the Xilinx VDMA driver(xilinx_vdma_channel_set_config ) defined as a function prototype in the include/linux/amba/xilinx_dma.h
And is being used by Xilinx videos  drivers.
Those video driver need to use the (xilinx_vdma_channel_set_config) which requires this global header file.

Could you please suggest us whether that header file (Xilinx_dma.h) should be there  in include/linux/amba or we should move it to include/linux?
And any functional comments for this v4 patch?


Regards,
Kedar.
