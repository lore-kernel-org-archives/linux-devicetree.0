We have hundreds of real PADs on real SoC.  If we are trying to
describe real hard on dts its own, dts has to be big.

I was told that the binding should not be bonded to Linux
implementation.  Now I'm told to go the opposite direction? ;)

Specifying string in dts, and then parsing the string, mapping it to
one of the huge MX53_PAD_ definition in kernel init code?

One thing I'm trying to do is to replace those huge iomux-mx*.h headers
with dts binding, and then get rid of those headers from Linux tree.
I guess moving those huge hardware details that kernel does not care
to dts is one goal of device tree support, no?

We end up with continuing maintaining those huge iomux-mx*.h headers
in kernel tree.

Getting kernel tree cleaned-up is one major reason why we are doing
device tree.  But I feel you are trying to make dts clean and leave
the 'crap' stay in kernel tree.

This seems working for me.  But it still has the problem of being
bonded to Linux implementation, and it's not easy to change pad setting
for debugging.

Overall, I'm not convinced that any of these 3 options is better than
what I have right now :)
