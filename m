For all practical purposes we still have all the clocks as potential
parents during automatic clock selection - and that includes:
PLLA_PER, PLLH_AUX and TESTDEBUGX.

Not all of them are enabled, but some are - so If I select an i2s 
frequency of "3903125" then plla_per will get used with a divider of 2.

You misunderstand my argument here!

I know that it may be automated, but you may have different devices
connected to: i2s/pcm, pwm, gp and slim.

Some of them need the audio spreading, while others need a stable
waveform - as mentioned mash3 varies the period between:
(divi-2)/fparent and (divi+4)/fparent in discrete steps
For this the worsted case is a requested frequency that results
in a divider between 4 and 5.

Also some DAC require a STABLE clock waveform on i2s with
specific requirements for ton/(ton+toff) between 40% and 60%,
as they have their own internal PLL, while others do not need
this kind of behavior and can handle variable period-length.
But then these DAC still have a minimum period length, which we
may not exceed.

So making an automatic selection is not possible hence
we need a means to configure the supported mash level
to get the best results in all cases.

That was a general side note not necessarily related to PLLC.
But this may be better handled by a generic clock driver
similar to clk-fixed-factor.

See the argument of different devices/DAC with different requirements.
There is no way for any of this to work automatically and make every
client happy.
