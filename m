Yes - the ETMv4 spec defines what should be in the core / debug power
domains, but there is no architectural requirement for these to be
separate.
Most of power management is "implementation defined", & hw designers
seem to have different criteria than sw engineers wanting to debug
stuff.

Sadly this might include some that do not behave in an ideal way.

I'm not saying disabling CPUIdle is right for all cases, or perhaps
many, but it has in the past been useful in specific instances - not
just for external debug, but to use CoreSight trace etc, were powering
down the a CPU / cluster takes out ETM accesses and breaks stuff.

The key is that to use this driver, the user has to be aware of the PM
implications on their specific system - the kernel may not take care
of it all for them - as SCP type power controllers are often external
and may have unique firmware and capabilites.

Historically CPUIdle disable has been used as a blunt instrument to
handle power management problems in real debug use cases - but it is
one that has been successful. Where there are better methods then I am
all for using these.

For your case, removing what you are interested in debugging is
evidently counter productive, so other techniques need to be used to
ensure the CS regs remain alive.
But equally there could be use cases where this might be just fine or
even the only way.

It is difficult and highly platform dependent. For external debug we
might have per-platform rules built into the debugger on what can and
cannot be done and when, plus on occasion some power management
scripts. Those platforms that get closest to the "standard" CoreSight
power management are easiest to debug.

I'm not advocating /nohlt above anything else - it's just what is
being discussed here. Furthermore, no one debug technique is ever
going to be appropriate in all circumstances - debug and trace are
always a compromise.

I initially raised the issue of clusters powering down, and
possibility that no CPUIdle might prevent this, to ensure that
awareness is built in to driver / config / help text /documentation
that these are real issues seen in the external debug world.

The key point is that the caveat in using this driver is that the
power management has to be considered on a platform specific basis
before it is configured; and appropriate actions may be needed for it
to work correctly. Without this then the driver could cause more
issues than it debugs. A user selecting this _must_ be told about
these issues
