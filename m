In my patches phandles are used. That works pretty good for almost all 
DTs. So almost all dependencies are already declared in a DT and almost 
no changes to the DT are necessary. The only binding I've seen where it 
doesn't work is remote-endpoint, because that binding isn't a directed 
dependency. So one of the two places where such a binding occurs needs a 
"no-dependencies = <phandle>" to avoid circular dependencies which can 
be solved.

Already there in form of phandles.

My patches offer the possibility to extend or reduce the list of 
(automatically generated) dependencies by using "[no-]dependencies = < 
list of phandles >;"

None in my approach. The DT just includes an additional binding to 
circumvent the missing but needed type information for phandles.
