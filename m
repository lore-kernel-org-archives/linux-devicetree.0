I was very clear which new Socionext 96board platform my remark was
about. There not being a socionext.txt file before this patch here hints
at there being no official SoC binding defined for any.

Adding one would require coordinating how to go about these platforms,
as unsuccessfully attempted here.

I was also referring to off-list remarks wrt EDK2 DT vs. Linux, which
could've well come from you, given your rant. Note that both the
bindings maintainer and one arm-soc maintainer are from Linaro afaik, so
you're essentially fighting against your colleagues here...

Last but not least pretty much every shipping 96Board to date had a
pre-installed DT that did not have official bindings submitted (I don't
count the Cello as shipping) and thus later changed incompatibly.

Because with a .dtsi for SoC and SoM we can share DT code across boards
and bootloaders. And at least one .dts is needed for compile-testing it.

potentially aggregated as submodules.

DT patch reviews have resulted in GIC nodes growing virtualization
support for instance, and there have been in-tree refactorings fixing
the arch timer's interrupt type iirc. Comparing modeling across vendors
is also useful to not live in silos.

Also considering that drivers are spread over subsystem rather than SoC
directories these days, the central location being Linux facilitates
checking which platforms have been enabled already and to which degree.

If you ask questions, you may get answers. Blame yourself if you
intended them as rhetorical questions.

Please don't argue with me about these fundamentals. Not my decisions!

This is not about distros shipping things; there is no openSUSE on these
platforms precisely because code is not in central repositories.

It's rather about three platforms by one vendor all going into different
directions: SC2A11 into some seemingly non-mainline EDK2, MB86S71 as
vendor kernel / U-Boot tarballs (and my kernel patches here), and
UniPhier as only one in mainline kernel and mainline U-Boot.

Have you ever tried to boot e.g. a HiKey with a DT not from the mainline
kernel you are trying to boot? Good luck... Even server vendors
occasionally change their device trees with firmware updates.

Fact is, as platforms get enabled, device trees grow additional nodes
and properties. DTs don't fall from skies in some final form for new SoCs.

Especially not if they keep getting written by volunteers like me - I'm
already enabling the fourth 96board because Linaro and its partners keep
throwing ~3.10 kernels at users again and again and again, which as I've
pointed out at BUD17 is highly annoying! Even more annoying every single
time Linaro marketing asks people to join as paying members because
Linaro supposedly does so awesome Open Source work and such great
96Boards. Just this Friday again.
Nobody needs Reference Platform kernels if everything just timely gets
merged into linux-next and mainline, where code belongs.
Same for device trees, until the powers that be decide on a different
location - which would not change the problem at all: Every review will
be regarded as churn by someone else, and some people will always be
lazy in submitting patches to whatever widely agreed-upon location, be
it kernel drivers or DTs or U-Boot or EDK2 or ATF or something else.

We wouldn't be having this argument if everything were great with the
various non-central 96boards trees and downstream DTs.

Andreas
