Ah, thank you. I would prefer to stay away from auxdata, since it involves
placing more platform-specific data into the kernel, and it is my
understanding that auxdata is intended as a temporary measure. The
/aliases approach looks interesting, and I'll see what I can do with it -
hopefully I can have an RFC / patch soon. It looks like we would want an
"inverse" alias lookup- that is, we would need to know which alias
corresponds to a given node. Is it possible for a node to have multiple
aliases? If so, which shall we use to create the device name? Anyway, I
will further look into how these aliases work.
