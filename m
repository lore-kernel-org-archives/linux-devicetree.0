    SDHCI is the SD host controller standard, while the names should describe 
"the function of the device and not its precise programming model". SDIO isn't 
the physical interface name, the physical interface underneath is still SD. 
"mmcsd" or "mmc-sd" would be appropriate, however just "mmc" is typically used.

    Yes, MMC/SD node names are not yet standardized.

    Because people for the most part are not aware of it, despite 
http://www.devicetree.org/Device_Tree_Usage points to ePAPR and the section 
2.4 of this page also tells to use generic names.

    Why on earth they'll need change?!
