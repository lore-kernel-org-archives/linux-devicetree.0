Regarding the latter case, this is a violation of the intent of
always-on clocks. I think a firmly worded sentence in the binding should
suffice.

So the common clock binding could have a new always-on list added to it,
but the clock can still be claimed and gated by drivers? I'll think on
it a bit but always-on is not the right name in that case. It is a more
general solution however (since it could still cover the sub-case of
clocks always remaining on since a driver never claims them).
