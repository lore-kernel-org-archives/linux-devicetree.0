Dear Jason Gunthorpe,

The fact that the bootloader sets this MBus window is more-or-less
irrelevant because when the mvebu-mbus driver is initialized, it
completely clears *all* existing MBus windows:

   http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/bus/mvebu-mbus.c#n722

Therefore, when the kernel starts, what the bootloader may have set up
in terms of MBus windows is irrelevant.

Right.

I indeed remember some objections, but I'm not sure what they were
precisely. Maybe we didn't had a precise use case back at the time, to
really make people objecting realize what the problem was?

On the other hand, I think the of_*() API is quite limited when it
comes to updating the DT. If I remember correctly, you can update some
nodes, but you can never reclaim the memory that was used for the
previous value of the node. So any change to the in-memory DT
representation is basically a memory leak for the entire lifetime of
the system (of course, I might be wrong on this, I haven't dived into
all the hardcore details of DT manipulation in the kernel).

I'm not sure what would be the alternate mechanism to hook into the
address translation. of_translate_one(), where all the translation
through ranges takes place is really tied to the DT only, adding
another mechanism to hook some custom address translation in there
seems a bit weird, no?

Yes, because at boot time the mvebu-mbus driver will set up windows for
the statically defined ranges (the one you've written explicitly in the
DT), and then later one when the PCIe driver will initialize, it will
enumerate devices, realize that it needs a PCIe memory window, and ask
the mvebu-mbus driver to create, which will fail because an overlapping
window already exists.

However, it just works by pure luck: nothing guarantees you that the
PCIe 0 memory window will start at 0xe0000000. Of course, since you
have only one PCIe interface enabled, you have a guarantee from one
boot to another. But in the general case, if you have several PCIe
interfaces, on which you may plug/unplug different devices, you have no
guarantee a priori as to what will be the base address of the PCIe
memory window for a given PCIe interface.

Best regards,

Thomas
