Not a PCI expert, just trying to find out the proper location for this shared driver.

That driver exists but it is not in mainline and it is better to directly
add it to proper location with correct io functions.
The question is if ioread/iowrite functions are correct one.
PowerPC io-defs.h suggests that readl/writel should be used for PCI.

If node property device_type pcie should be used.
device_type = "pcie";

For pci it is device_type = "pci";
For network it is device_type = "network"
the same for serial, watchdogs.

Do we have any list of device_types which we should use?

Thanks,
Michal
