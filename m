I remember it took a bit to understand your proposal, but I thought it
could work, but I admit I forget all the little details now :(

Ah, if I can just rephrase simply - the notion was to move the
determination of the aperture to use dynmic allocation and then
restructure the ranges around the mbus target, since they no longer
need to encode the aperture.

My concern: dynamically sizing the aperture is hard. There are three
apertures that need to be picked, and the PCI core code has no support
for dynamic apertures. Getting the aperture from the DT is a
functional compromise.

This seems to get really complicated if the mbus driver is ever
required to support dynamic mappings.. If PCI-E claims all memory and
then you modprobe something it could fail.

IMHO, I go back to my original thoughts. There is no real need for any
of this to be dynamic, we can use the values in the DT, presumably set
by the bootloader and things will work well.

The added complexity and failure modes for dynamic is simply not worth
it..
