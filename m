Hi Roy, Matt, Nishant, Harb Abdulhamid, Loc,

I have a gut feeling you guys were part of the SCMI spec committee. If
so, could you please chime in?

No, the controllers can not ... unless you clone and adapt the 9
drivers+bindings to conform to the expectations of SCMI (like you
attempted with MHU recently). Also, then mandate every future
controller driver must emulate "doorbell" channels.

As the mailbox maintainer, I am open to suggestions that would allow
every controller to support SCMI.
But compared to the options of scmi-as-a-library and
scmi-as-child-node-of-platform-parent, this does not even qualify as
an option.

Why? Because SCMI is but one protocol that provides 4 features ATM,
and certainly can not provide for every whim and quirk of future
platforms.  Among the sane requirements are watchdog,
suspend/resume/hibernation and thermal _control_ (not just sensor
readings) and among the weird are video, network and storage over
mailbox api. And even a filesystem backed by read/write over mailbox!!
 And these are only that I have worked on first hand.

  The point is : you can not assume SCMI to be the only protocol
running over a controller _and_ you can not dictate other protocols to
not touch certain bits of the signal register/fifo.

In simplest terms, controller driver can not cater to only a
particular client. That's the reason we have the controller driver
define the message format and clients conform to it.

Thanks.
