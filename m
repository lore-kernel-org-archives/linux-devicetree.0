I think the terminology you're using here is quite confusing.

Are you talking about having two different compatible values for two
different HW designs, where those different designs implement different
sets of clocks (which makes sense), or two different DT nodes for two
different clocks (which IMHO doesn't always, unless those different
clocks *truly* are separate IP blocks with completely independent
register regions, and where those IP blocks are likely to be re-used
as-is in other chips).
