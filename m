I'm never really sure with these where the split point should be, almost
every change in here could be its own patch if I really wanted to pad my
kernel patch count, but this series is already 17 patches long and I
usually see these all as the same logical action: non-functional cleanups.

I agree the added error message isn't purely non-functional and so
should be broken out, I'll break out a couple other changes for v2.
