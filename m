Yes, exactly.

Yes, that seems questionable, although perhaps within the context of
only enabling the driver on PPC specifically, it may be reasonable.

This may or may not be a mistake.

The idea is that usb-ehci is included in the device node's compatible
list iff the HW is 100% compatible with a "usb-ehci" HW device, and
hence a pure usb-ehci driver can handle the hardware without any
additional knowledge. (That's true in general for any compatible value).

It's quite possible that this often gets translated to the subtly
different "the HW is an EHCI controller, so it gets
compatible="usb-ehci"" when writing .dts files.

So yes we probably should remove compatible="usb-ehci" from any device
node for HW which really isn't a pure EHCI device. That would presumably
require looking at the existing custom drivers and/or HW specs to
determine what, if anything, is different about the HW.

Related, at least on Tegra, the PHY handling is IIRC pretty tightly
coupled into the EHCI driver. We probably should have separate nodes
for, and drivers for, the PHYs instead. I don't know if that would
remove all the non-standard attributes of the Tegra EHCI HW and hence
allow Tegra's EHCI to be handled by the generic driver. From memory,
there are certainly some HW workarounds in the Tegra EHCI driver that
would need to be ported though.

That's certainly a reasonable way to go too. I think the only downside
with that approach is that every new device needs a kernel update to add
it to the table, whereas using a generic compatible="usb-ehci" wouldn't,
assuming no quirks were required for the new device.
