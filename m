we need to blacklist the AA:AA:.. address in the hci_bcm.c driver. Once you load the firmware, then it has a proper address. I need to confirm this with a second rPI3, but it seems loading the firmware is actually important for this card.

Non of these Yocto patches are actually needed. The culprit is the .oper_speed setting to be 4Mbps. Once you reduce that to 921600 thing will start to work smoothly. I sent a patch that takes the .oper_speed out completely and only applies it for the ACPI based devices where we know that it works.

With my patch and the right DT entries for uart0 it actually works with “btattach -B /dev/ttyAMA0 -P bcm”. It will load the firmware, configure it and head towards the right path.

Obviously btattach is only an interim step here. Loic’s patches for serdev integration and changing the DT to expose uart0 as serial-slave for Bluetooth is the right approach. Once Loic’s resends the patches we can get them into bluetooth-next and start merging these towards upstream. After that, Bluetooth should work just out of the box like with any USB dongle.

And the Yocto patches should be abandoned. If using H:5 (aka 3-Wire) instead of H:4 is possible, we could consider it, but as long as the UART wiring doesn’t cause any bit errors, it is not worth it.

That said, I do see a "Bluetooth: hci0: Frame reassembly failed (-84)” error. I need to figure out where that is. Frankly we really need to hexdump the packet when this happens.

Regards

Marcel
