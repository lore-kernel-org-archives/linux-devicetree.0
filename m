I'd agree that it would be reasonable for the secure OS to fall back to
parsing /chosen in the absence of /secure-chosen, but if the latter is
present I would (at least naively) expect it to be authoritative. I can
imagine the case of a cut-down version of some system implementing only
one UART, where you might want to tell the Normal world OS to use that
and the Secure OS to keep its output to itself - allowing fallbacks at
the individual property level would make that harder than it needs to
be, and in general seems like it might be more confusing than useful.

Maintaining the principal that "secure-X" takes complete precedence over
"X" seems to me to be the least surprising; it's just that in this one
case X gets to be an entire node rather than a property because /chosen
is special.
