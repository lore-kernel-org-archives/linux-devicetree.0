Ok. Please don't spend too much time on it though.

Device drivers can figure out what device the driver is bound to
based on the compatible string of the node. Typically, the clk
driver binds to a device node with a compatible indicating the
clock controller it is, like spd,soc-name-clk-controller-name.
Then that can be used to determine what sort of associated data
there is.

Some mailing list digging may be helpful, but I admit I need to
have some sort of canned response here that I can just repeat
each time this comes up. Here it goes.

We really only need CLK_OF_DECLARE() if a clk needs to be
available for timers or interrupt controllers. Otherwise, its
possible to put the rest of the clk tree registration in the
normal device driver path.

Reasons (in no particular order):

  1. We get a dev pointer to use with clk_hw_register()

  2. We can handle probe defer if some resource is not available

  3. Using device model gets us a hook into power management frameworks
     like runtime PM and system PM for things like suspend and hibernate

  4. It encourages a single DT node clk controller style binding
     instead of a single node per clk style binding

  5. We can use non-DT specific functions like devm_ioremap_resource() to map
     registers and acquire other resources, leading to more portable and
     generic code

  6. We may be able to make the device driver a module, which will
     make distros happy if we don't have to compile in all
     these clk drivers to the resulting vmlinux
