I was thinking about patch 1 & 2 as independent patch of the clkc_ao
series..

anyway, as your suggestion in another thread,
I could include the patch 1 into next clkc_ao series
send patch 3 (DTS part) independently to Kevin, once patch 3 accepted
into mainline, I will then send patch 2 as a fix
(this will avoid breaking bisect)
