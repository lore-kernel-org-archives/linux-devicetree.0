Thanks Arnd

Ya, I made misunderstood, thanks for point out.

- dma-channels:         Number of DMA channels supported by the controller.
- dma-requests:         Number of DMA requests signals supported by the
                        controller.
So dma-channels is physical channel num, while dma-requests is virtual
channel num.
Will update.

Want to double check here.
Device need specific channel via request line, the requirement still
can be met, right?

Got it.

Thanks
