I have one basic question about this series: if pxa27x gets moved
to used the common-clk framework but the others (pxa25x, pxa26x,
pxa3xx, pxa93x) don't, does that imply that they become mutually
exclusiv at compile-time?

If so, do you plan to first complete all of them before merging
upstream, or do you intend to have one or more kernel releases
that don't allow building a combined kernel for all pxa platforms?
I don't object to doing the latter, but if that is the plan, you
need to make that very clear in the changelog and have all the
relevant maintainers agree to that.

Also (for my understanding) when you say that you plan to do
pxa25x and pxa3xx next, does that include pxa26x and pxa93x?
I assume it does as they are apparently minor revisions of the
former, but it's not completely clear from your description.
