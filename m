Agreed, it is possible that the versions can be still incompatible. 
Shall move it to
driver in v2.

This property is used to select the bank. The naming lead to confusion.
I shall change it to bank_select.
If it is recommended to register each L3 cache bank as separate PMU then
this property will be moved to driver.
