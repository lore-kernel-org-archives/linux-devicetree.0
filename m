This binding forces all the dai links to share the same card level 
properties. I find it problematic in these cases:

>> - simple-audio-card,format		: CPU/CODEC common audio format.
>> 					  "i2s", "right_j", "left_j" , "dsp_a"
>> 					  "dsp_b", "ac97", "pdm", "msb", "lsb"

The code allows having the format parameter in sub nodes too, but the 
document does no mention it. Adding a mention would solve this problem 
at least partly.

Neither does the document mention that 
"simple-audio-card,bitclock-inversion" and 
"simple-audio-card,frame-inversion" are also allowed in card level. 
Currently the code uses simple bit-wise-or from card-level and dai-level 
daifmt parameters, which may lead to broken daifmt setting. However, 
this on directly related to this patch.

>> - dai-tdm-slot-num			: Please refer to tdm-slot.txt.
>> - dai-tdm-slot-width			: Please refer to tdm-slot.txt.

These properties are actually only taken from sub-nodes so the document 
is broken but the code is ok.

In general this binding would look better if another sub-node level 
would added for dai-link related properties, including the cpu and codec 
sub-nodes, but that would break the backwards compatibility.

Best regards,
Jyri
