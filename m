Thanks, I'll take a look at that.

I didn't answer it explicitly, my apologies.

The behaviour is to periodically emit the state of all enabled GPIOs
(i.e. the ngpios value), one per bus clock cycle. There's no explicit
addressing scheme, the protocol encodes the value for a given GPIO
by its position in the data stream relative to a pulse on the "load data"
(LD) line, whose envelope covers the clock cycle for the last GPIO in
the sequence. Similar to SPI the bus has both out and in lines, which
cater to output/input GPIOs.

A rough timing diagram for a 16-GPIO configuration looks like what
I've pasted here:

Hope that helps.
