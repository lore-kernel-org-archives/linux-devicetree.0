The Xen hypervisor tells Linux which devices are protected by an SMMU,
preprogrammed by Xen, so that Linux can avoid the swiotlb and bounce
buffers for DMA requests involving them.
The information is present on device tree and parsed at boot time by
Linux.

Julien is proposing to store the list of "safe" devices on an hash table
in the Xen specific code (in arch/arm/xen/enlighten.c, see
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=139291370526082&w=2).
Whenever Linux is about to do DMA, we would check in the hashtable to
figure out whether we need to go through the swiotlb or we can simply
use the native dma_ops.

Ian and I were thinking that it would be much easier and faster to have
a "xen_safe_device" parameter in struct device and just check for that.
It doesn't actually need to be in struct device, it could simply be a
flag in struct device_dma_parameters as Ian was suggesting.

Julien, could you please come up with a simple patch to demonstrate the
concept?
