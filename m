I few more details about this. I have actually measured the voltage
with/without pull-down on the SoC side (which competes with the 10K
pull-up resistor on the PCB) and the results are the following. The
voltage drops from 3.306V to 3.187V on one board and from 3.325V to
3.204V on another. Based on these numbers, we can in estimate
pull-down resistors used for GPIO inside of the A10 SoC as something
like ~270K Ohm.

As such, it looks like we can do reliable runtime detection of
pcDuino1 and pcDuino2 variants by probing this PD2 pin. The most
appropriate place to do the runtime detection is probably the board
type selection stub (sunxi-bootsetup), run as the initial part of
a Linux distribution installer. We are perfectly fine having
separate dts files for the pcDuino1/pcDuino2 boards and the
kernel does not need to become more complicated.

Probing for pull-up and pull-down resistors on the PCB can be
generalized beyond just PD2 and used to further narrow down the
selection of compatible boards (sunxi-bootsetup currently only
considers the SoC type, DRAM size and DRAM bus width for this).

Additional very interesting observation is that the reference
Allwinner schematics and Cubieboard/Cubietruck boards use 510K
pull-down resistor for the USB power switches. With 270K pull-up
by the SoC and 510K pull-down by a resistor on the PCB, the
resulting voltage is going to be around ~2.2V, which should be
enough to be interpreted as digital 1. And indeed, a quick test
shows that if we just configure either PH3 or PH6 pin as input
with pull-up, then the corresponding USB port gets powered up
on the Cubieboard :-)

There are two important consequences:
* As far as generic device independent code is concerned, we can
  reasonably safely enable USB power on the Cubieboard, Cubietruck
  and other device, which did not deviate from the reference
  Allwinner schematics and used 510K pull-down resistors. Configuring
  pins for input can't possibly do much harm (if any at all).
* By doing run-time checks, we can see the difference between the
  boards using 10K pull-down resistors (OLIMEX boards) and the boards
  using 510K pull-down resistors (CubieTech boards).
