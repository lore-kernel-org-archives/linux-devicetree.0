Yeah, that's what I meant about the first parent's commit not being a 
clearly tagged branch point. At least you get the series on one page. 
Maybe it's time for a rebase or a v4 series Steve?

Personally, I use a bare repo with multiple remotes and fetch branches 
from various trees. Then gitk --all --since(etc) is pretty good at 
giving the overview picture. You don't need to pull the commits over 
into any of your working branches if you don't want to.
