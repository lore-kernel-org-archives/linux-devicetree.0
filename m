does that mean the driver does this correctly and really waits for the completion. Or does the GPIO expander might return to quickly and returns a false sense of GPIO state. I think it would be good a sleep of 50ms after the GPIO makes a difference. Maybe the GPIO expander driver needs to take this into account.

Reality is that once the Bluetooth driver toggled the GPIO, it goes onto initializing the chip. One other reason might be that no device wakeup GPIO is wired here, that the chip actually needs some time before it is all good to go.

Marcel
