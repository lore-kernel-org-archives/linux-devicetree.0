My point was to decouple it from the Linux specific CMA implementation.
I was talking to Jesse Barker about a binding for ION regions (which
should eventually move to CMA). He needs pretty much the same binding.

The way it was described to me was to allocate a region, but not care
where it actually existed in RAM. I don't know how important a
requirement it is.
