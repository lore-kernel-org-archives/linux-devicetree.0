Ok. It's worth noting that memreserves allow the kernel to map the
memory with cacheable attributes, which can result in coherency problems
if it's expected to access any buffer with non-cacheable attributes.

So you expect userspace clients rather than kernel drivers plugging into
this framework?

I'm not sure that your proposed kernel/user split is ideal. How does
userspace determine the appropriate TEE client to use? What's required
in the way of arbitration between clients?

Ok.

How does having more than one TEE work given there's a single conduit?

I'd imagine the SMCCC stuff could live at include/linux/arm_smccc.h
(following the example of efi.h).

That assumes that the TEE has to know about any kernel that might run.
It also implies that a kernel needs to know what each TEE thinks the
kernel will be mapping memory as, so it can work around whatever
decision has been made by the TEE.

So as it stands I think that's a broken design. The attributes you need
should be strictly specified. It's perfectly valid for that strict
specification to be the same attributes the kernel uses now, but the
spec can't change later.

Otherwise mismatched attributes will get in the way on some platform,
and it's going to be close to impossible to fix things up.

If this is the header for userspace, the comments should be useful to
userspace. Surely you can have a different structure kernel-side if you
need to encode different values?

Thanks,
