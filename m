Gabriel,

great you can boot a recent kernel. I guess you had to quite heavily
modify current dove-cm-a510.dts? Can you upload the one you use now
to any pastebin and send the link?

You didn't mention if you really use the sb-a510, i.e. the Compulab
reference baseboard. Is it what you are using with your cm-a510?

Not quite true. Video is made up of at least 4 different devices:
Framebuffer, GPU, Decode engine, and usually DVI/HDMI transmitter or
VGA.

We do have a driver for the framebuffer (armada_drm) and there is great
work from Russell King and others on the GPU and Decode engine (IIRC).

If you are using the sb-a510, I can see from the manual, that DVI
transmitter is SIL164.. AFAIS there is a driver for it, that maybe
needs some polishing. Nobody ever tested VGA, but it shouldn't be too
hard to add support for it as it is directly supported by the
framebuffer HW.

One quite important driver at least for Dove is a clock source for
video. Internal clock generators for video are way to limited with
respect to frequencies to allow any useful resolution.

I'll see if I can have a look at the dts stuff this weekend.. that
way we'll have at least the basic done before moving to the other
devices.

Sebastian
