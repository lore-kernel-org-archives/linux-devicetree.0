Ah no. Not only it's different between different iproc variants, it's
also different between plls on the same soc.

You meant to pass in both the gate register offset and its bit shift
through the clock specifier? But isn't the current ASIU clock code much
more consistent with the rest of the iProc clock code?

Good suggestion. That would make it more clear and easier to read. Will do.

Agreed. Will do this for all iproc clock setup calls. Thanks.
