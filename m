This sentence is incomplete.  Maybe the "one number." two lines below is 
part of this sentence?  If so, I'm not sure I understand the meaning.  
Did you mean to say "If a single interrupt is shared by all GPIO pins, 
the value is a single integer." ?  What is the meaning if there are 
multiple integers in the value?

"The name" implies that there is a single value, but the example below 
shows multiple values.

See above.

The text above says "mrvl,pxa-gpio" *or* "mrvl,mmp-gpio", but the 
example has both.  If both are necessary, the word "and" would be more 
appropriate.

What is the point of having both names in the device tree?  If the Linux 
driver is known to support the MMP version of the GPIO hardware, there 
is no need for a "fallback" to the PXA version.   Fallback names are 
rarely needed for Linux, because new customized Linux kernels are easy 
to develop for new hardware.  Fallback names were intended for 
commercial operating systems where the hardware vendor must work with an 
OS version that is already in the field.

The text above does not mention "interrupt-controller" and 
"#interrupt-cells" properties for this node.

"CHIP" makes no sense in this sentence.  I presume that you meant to 
refer to a template name that contains "CHIP", but "mrvl,mmp-twsi" does 
not contain "CHIP".

Was this text copied from somewhere else and not edited?  It doesn't 
make sense here, and the example below has only a single number, so <a 
b> cannot be correct.

There is no interrupt-parent property in the example below.  I presume 
you mean to use the default where the device tree parent node is the 
interrupt parent.  If so, you should say that.

No need for two different values, as discussed above.
