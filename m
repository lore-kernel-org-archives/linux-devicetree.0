Will do this in next patch.
It was suggested by Arnd in v5, may be just of_parse code can be merged 
in this patch and the bindings made as separate patch.

I agree, Will remove this Linuxism from the bindings.

It should be actually 2. I will fix such mismatches in the other patches.

Yep, will get rid of this in next patch.

Yep, this examples should be fixed with proper unit address which is 
formed by "device-id,instance-id"

device id + Instance ID makes it unique, I though I already added 
details the reg property.
