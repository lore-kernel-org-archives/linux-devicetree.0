That's fine if run-time makes more sense. I'd just like to move in the 
direction of applying a hunk of changes rather than C code creating 
nodes and properties one-by-one.

Given that this binding section above is concerning 
allwinner,sunxi-q8-hardwaremgr, that is what I'm referring to.

Either the touchscreen node name is "touchscreen" or you can have 
compatible string for q8-touchscreen and use of_find_node_by_name or 
of_find_compatible_node. Doesn't matter what bus it is on. It only 
requires that there is only 1 node.

Either that, or if you have the board specific compatible in the 
touchscreen node, then you could have a driver for it. That driver would 
need to probe the device and then create the "real" device.

Can't non-DT based platform drivers do autoloading? Regardless, not 
really my problem from a binding perspective.

Generally we do prefer finding things by compatible strings. But there 
are exceptions and doing fix-ups like this is a good example.

Right.
