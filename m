Have you considered replacing this fine licensing boilerplate by the
new concise and cleaner SPDX ids?
Could it make sense, especially for new files, to avoid adding
boilerplate that will need to be cleaned up later?
You could get rid of these 37 lines and use this shorthand instead,
using the new conventions started by greg-kh and documented by tglx?

Thomas has sent a first doc patch [1] set and is working on an updated
version.  Jonathan also wrote a nice background article on the topic
at LWN [2].

And as a bonus, this device tree addition of yours minus this
boilerplate could save a few real trees if someone ever prints --god
forbid-- this file, so you would be making a good thing for the
planet! And consider too the energy savings from not having these
extra bytes transferred million of times and not retrieved from disks
spindles.
