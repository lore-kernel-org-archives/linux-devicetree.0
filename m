Yeah, it would be nice if you two stick together once again and work
that out for mainline?

Hmm, maybe it is just enough to tell the DRM driver to switch to
VGA and what i2c to use for DDC. I'll have to catch up with DRM
and DT.

Ok. That makes it less complicated as there already should be support
for dumb RGB anyway.

Well, this is not about a working corner case.. video modes are (more or
less) standardized and so is the clock frequency. Monitors are allowed
to reject any non-standard modes and it gets worse with TVs.

Ergo, we do want to hit the frequency as close as possible and Dove's
internal PLL simply cannot.
