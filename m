I started of with switch case but, as this card only uses 
MI2S_QUATERNARY and MI2S_PRIMARY I converted it to if else statements to 
save few lines.

This bit of code is writing to a mux control register, which would be 
very much specific to board wiring. Moving this to machine level could 
would introduce lot of un-necessary interface.

I agree, its confusing. The term external in this case describes the 
placement of codec w.r.t to SOC rather then the audio sink. on APQ8016 
we have an internal codec within the SOC which is wiredup to the Headset 
and on this board we have external ADV7533 codec which is connected to HDMI.

I will put this code to the apq8016_sbc_parse_of function.

Yes, you are right, setting card->dev = NULL is really unnecessary, I 
will fix it and also remove the special casing the EPROBE_DEFER.
There are 2 other drivers which need similar cleanup, I will fix them too.
