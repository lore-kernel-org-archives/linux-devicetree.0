Most i.MX SoCs have three instances of the chipidea core. These cores
share a single register space for controlling the mentioned bits (the
usbmisc register space). The usbmisc looks different on the different
SoCs.
Indeed they control some phy specific aspects, but the phy itself may
also be an external ULPI or UTMI phy with a separate driver. So if we
integrate the usbmisc into the phy wouldn't that mean that it has to
be integrated into all possible phy drivers?

>From a devicetrees perspective it makes sense to integrate the flags
into the chipidea nodes, because there is one node per chipidea core,
but only one usbmisc unit for all ports on the SoC. So we can do a:

	chipidea@ofs {
		disable-overcurrent = <1>;
	};

instead of

	usbmisc@ofs {
		disable-overcurrent-port0 = <1>;
		disable-overcurrent-port1 = <0>;
		...
	};

Hm, yes. That's what Richard does, right? I may be misunderstanding you
here.
