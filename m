Thankyou all for providing inputs and comments on previous versions of this patchset.
Here is the v4 of the patchset addressing all the issues raised as
part of previous versions review.

This patchset adds a new simple EEPROM framework to kernel.

Up until now, EEPROM drivers were stored in drivers/misc, where they all had to
duplicate pretty much the same code to register a sysfs file, allow in-kernel
users to access the content of the devices they were driving, etc.
    
This was also a problem as far as other in-kernel users were involved, since
the solutions used were pretty much different from on driver to another, there
was a rather big abstraction leak.
    
This introduction of this framework aims at solving this. It also introduces DT
representation for consumer devices to go get the data they require (MAC
Addresses, SoC/Revision ID, part numbers, and so on) from the EEPROMs.
    
Having regmap interface to this framework would give much better
abstraction for eeproms on different buses.

patch 1-2 Introduces two regmap helper functions.
patch 3-5 Introduces the EEPROM framework.
Patch 6 Adds helper functions for eeproms based on mmio.
Patch 7 migrates an existing driver to eeprom framework.
Patch 8-9 Adds Qualcomm specific qfprom driver.
Patch 10 adds entry in MAINTAINERS.

Its also possible to migrate other eeprom drivers to this framework.

Providers APIs:
	eeprom_register/unregister();

Consumers APIs:
	eeprom_cell_get()/of_eeprom_cell_get();
	eeprom_cell_put();
	eeprom_cell_read()/eeprom_cell_write();

Device Tree:

	/* Provider */
	qfprom: qfprom@00700000 {
		compatible 	= "qcom,qfprom";
		reg		= <0x00700000 0x1000>;
		...

		/* Data cells */
		tsens_calibration: calib@404 {
			reg = <0x404 0x10>;
		};

		serial_number: sn {
			reg = <0x104 0x4>, <0x204 0x4>, <0x30c 0x4>;

		};
		...
	};
	
	/* Consumer node */
	tsens: tsens {
		...
		calibration = <&tsens_calibration>;
		...
	};

userspace interface: binary file in /sys/class/eeprom/*/eeprom

ex:
hexdump /sys/class/eeprom/qfprom0/eeprom
