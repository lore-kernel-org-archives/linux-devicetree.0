It says so in the documentation, why do we need to repeat it? While I
do defer to platform maintainers judgement, if there is complete
disregard for the ABI then I won't. This single case alone doesn't
bother me so much, but if this is the pattern every kernel cycle I am
bothered.

Also, I'm inclined to go delete the text in the links above.

Everything should be reviewed. Subsystem/platform maintainers are
responsible for reviewing and getting DT help if needed. There is
documentation about this too. Maybe this system is not working well
and needs to be revisited. I know the reviews are better for some
subsystems than others. I am trying to be more actively reviewing
things, but subsystem maintainers still need to review them. They
should know their bindings better than me.

Even if we review all bindings, there will still be mistakes.
