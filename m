IANAL, but mixing MIT (which I suggest use as the other license) and GPL
files in one binary (the generated dtb file) is fine AFAIK, this happens
all the time. The resulting binary is simple GPL licensed. So it would
make sense to start with dual licensing new boards right away even before
the dtsi has been relicensed. It won't make any practical difference
until the dtsi is relicensed, but it means less work later on.
