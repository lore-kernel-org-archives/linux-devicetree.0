I can prepare patches containing the following changes, but I need to
test them first.

To be honest, I still don't see the problem with the "single child having
a reg" case. Sure, it's not required, but it's also not an invalid
representation. Also note that, depending on the board, we'll have to
define addresses in endpoints if there's more than one endpoint, which
IMO makes things even harder to follow, because in some cases endpoints
will be numbered and in the others they won't.
