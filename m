In a perfect world, the hardware designers would place _all_ of the registers needed to
support rebooting in a contiguous section of the memory map. However, this isn't the case
on some platforms, especially on ARM-based SoCs.

While I completely agree with you that the bindings describe hardware, I don't see how
Feng's work is contrary to that. Feng is working on logically-grouping an otherwise
"random" set of registers into a logical grouping. In this case, Feng is uniting a group
of registers and calling them the "reboot" register block.

>From what I understand, the arm-soc maintainers want to reduce (and perhaps even
eliminate) these board-specific constructs, and try to utilize common driver-code that
resides in the "driver" folder. I can vouch for the syscon/regmap framework as something
which would enable the effort.

Thanks,
Marc C
