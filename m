I still don't get it.  Why on earth would you insist on replacing the 
already existing ID value that is _already_ passed to the kernel by all 
ARM bootloaders with something evidently far more complex?

Please let's step back a bit.

DT is a mean to help making the code more generic and reduce the amount 
of machine specific code, not to increase it in other ways.  While the 
ID passed in r1 makes perfect sense to me as it is simple and straight 
forward, using the DT for this provides absolutely no advantage.

Yet we still need the ID into r1 to distinguish between a DT boot from a 
legacy boot.  So it is much simpler to always have the ID to select 
whether a specific machine is being booted, or if the DT should later be 
used to configure the kernel for a specific machine.  No special code 
path is needed, etc.

Moving the ID into the DT just for the sake of it is not useful.
