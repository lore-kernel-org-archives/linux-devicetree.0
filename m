Correct. I changed these a couple of times while trying to understand
what the fields are, and I missed this instance. I'm still not sure
whether we actually need all four fields, or what the simplest format
for them would be. This just mirrors what you had in your binding.

No. You can have multiple declarations for a static symbol like this,
but only one of them with an initilizer. I usually recommend against
doing this myself, because it's confusing and somewhat bad style, but
it is correct C.

I think not. AFAIK the filter function will be called for each channel
on each DMA engine until one of them matches.

Yes it can be in dw_dma_chan or yes it is a memory leak?

That was my interpretation from reading the code, but I have not tried it.

Ok, Very good. What is the encoding of the registers then?

Right, my mistake.

Thanks a lot for the input. When I fix the above, are actually able
to test the changes, or have you lost access to the hardware when
leaving ST?
