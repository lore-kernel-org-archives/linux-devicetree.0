The devicetree was designed to handle hardware descriptions, not
configuration options.

Chosing the clock parent is probably in the grey area between hardware
description and configuration, so I assume when we find a good reason to
add this option to the devicetree then it's acceptable to add it there.

But we shouldn't add this option for something that, as you say, 'might
not actually ever get done'. Just hardcode the clock selection in SoC
code for now. If someone ever finds the good reason to make this configurable
then he will speak up and we can discuss this again.
