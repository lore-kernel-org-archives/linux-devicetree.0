OK. So even there's only one TV TCON, you still have to program all muxes w=
ith
the correct value, to prevent a) a bad value left by the bootloader and b) =
bad
reset default values.

I think that is the ultimate goal. However, the muxing would be a bit
complicated. For all the past SoCs, we were dealing with muxing the
downstream encoder. Now we will be muxing mixer and tcon connections
as well. You would also have to dynamically switch around the mixer
and/or tcon pointers in sun4i_crtc so existing code can still work.

That is what mirroring is supposed to mean, right? For instance you could
have VGA on one and HDMI on the other, at the same resolution and dotclock.

As far as I'm concerned, the software doesn't need to have all features
covered. But that doesn't mean the hardware representation can lack
features as well. We already did that once, and now we have some legacy
graph parsing code to handle that.
