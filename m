Hi Neil,

I don't have any Odroid-C2 board, but having to live without cpufreq
sounds bad for the Odroid-C2 users.
What would we expect from a kernel perspective (maybe the Hardkernel
guys would adjust their u-boot instead of us adjusting to the behavior
of one specific device? one solution that I could think of involves
the "maxcpus" kernel parameter (see [0]), if this is not set u-boot
should report a max CPU frequency of 1536MHz (= max frequency for 4
active cores). Based on the "maxcpus" value additional frequencies can
be unlocked (this could be step-by-step if there are different
frequencies for one core/two cores/etc.). However, I'd like to hear
other opinions as well.


Regards,
Martin
