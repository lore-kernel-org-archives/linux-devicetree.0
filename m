Sure, but even with the demux that's still the case (because it pretends
that this mismatch is a HW property rather than a property of the set of
drivers sharing the interrupt).

Whether there's a demux node in the DTB is entirely separate from
whether the drivers can actually handle the situation.

So if we need a warning in the presence of mismatch and action masking,
we need the exact same warning with the demux.

Sure.

I can certainly see the point about watning to keep this clean,
regardless.

Ok. I am happy to rework to that effect.

People are still going to hack around that with a demux, regardless of
whether the drivers can actually handle the situation. I'm happy to keep
a pr_warn regardless, though with the masking the situation doesn't
necessarily require a backtrace.

The presence of a demux implies the DTB author believes they have solved
the problem with the demux, not necessarily that they have considered
the situation and updated drivers appropriately. Relying on the demux to
imply that everything is fine only gives us the illusion that everything
is fine.

Thanks,
Mark.
