No, I meant what I wrote - I would prefer patch 1 to be merged before patch 4 (or at least
in the same release) to avoid the need for another firmware change, hence delaying patch
4 is good. It makes sense for the other commits to be merged in that order, but the
normal compatible-string fallback mechanism means there is no hard dependency there.
