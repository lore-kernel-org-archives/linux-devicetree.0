Sorry for the slow response.

Tested using NVIDIA springbank/seaboard board. Just in case anyone reads 
this later and wonders how: I will point out that in the baseline 
v4.11-rc4, the LCD (or perhaps just its backlight) doesn't work on this 
HW any more, but since the GUI login prompt plays a sound, I was still 
able to validate the WM8903 change.
