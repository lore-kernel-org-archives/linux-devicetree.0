I normally don't accept MFDs with just one device enabled.  Since it's
not really an MFD (M == Multi) until it has more than one function.

ifc is a horrible variable name - just sayin'.

Right, I understand what's happening.  I just think the semantics are
wrong.  The Subsystem (I'm assuming it's a Subsystem) requests for
status and it ends up initiating a start-up sequence.  Just from a
purist's point of view (I understand that it "works"), it's not good
practice.

I suggest fully starting the device in probe() is a better approach.

I don't see how this is used, so it's difficult for me to advise
fully, but I find this confusing.  Pin name/number?  Shouldn't this be
handed by Pinctrl?

intr1 could be quite ambiguous.  Especually as the '1' could easily be
read as an 'l'.  Suggest that 'irq1' or 'irq_1' or 'irq_one'.
