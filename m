OK - I sent an incremental update for the one thing that changed in
the tas571x driver from V3 to V4.

Note that the regcache changes were intentionally ordered before the
tas571x commits, because the regcache changes are needed for the new
driver to work correctly.  In the for-next branch I see the tas571x
commits, but not the regcache changes.
