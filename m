Surely that means you need to have every possible user-space client
present in a given filesystem, and you need to have all of them try to
probe the FW to figure out whether appropriate FW is present? That
sounds somewhat heavyweight.

To me it would seem a lot better to have the minimal drivers in the
kernel that get probed based on information from the FW. The main TEE
driver would query the generic APIs to discover which features are
exposed, then instantiate the relevant set of TEE-specific drivers based
on TEE_IOC_VERSION and friends. To handle a need for userspace
components you could emit uevents as necessary, though I'm still unclear
on what the userspace components would do.

That covers detection, but what about arbitrartion?

What happens when I have multiple clients which want to communicate with
the same TEE simultaneously?

What do TEE supplicants do?

I'm not sure I follow the question. Will these specific attributes be
mandated by the OP-TEE spec? The set of attributes above are certainly
better specified than simply "CACHED", though it would be nice to have
an architectural definition rather than just a bag of bits.

The architecture maintainers will need to look at the memory attributes
too. I don't think that current APIs offer fine-grained control over
attributes and a UP kernel may not map memory as shareable, for example.

Thanks,
Mark.
