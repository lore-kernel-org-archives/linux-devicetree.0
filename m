Hahaha.  Having said that though, I still strongly agree with what we
have.  Giving the kernel only one or the other avoids any weirdness
about which the kernel should choose when both are present.  The
bootwrapper atag-to-dt conversion is a migration and development tool,
and it should not do any DT manipulation must be kept to a bare
minimum.
