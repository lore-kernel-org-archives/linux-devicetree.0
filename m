Add a global flag, bool __init of_dtb_needs_copy, and make it default to
false. On platforms that need it, change it to true. Make
unflatten_device_tree() check the flag and copy the tree if necessary.
Make early_init_dt_scan() set the flag if it choses to use a default
built-in tree. Then get rid of unflatten_and_copy_devicetree() because
it has become redundant.

Finally, make an explicit backup __dtb pointer.  Don't assume that
__dtb_start == __dtb_end is the correct test. We never want to have that
behavour on arm/powerpc/microblaze, but that doesn't mean there won't be
compiled in dtbs for other reasons. Create a __dtb_default symbol
require platforms to do something specific (ie. select a config symbol)
to set it to __dtb_start. It's not perfect, but at least it acknowledges
the problem and can be refined later.
