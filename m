Those changes should normally go through the arm-soc tree, but we
have not done that so far for arm64 stuff, so I'm not blaming anybody.

The dts changes all look good to me, and I think it's ok to have them
go through your tree this time.

In the future, we should all have an eye on this more to ensure that
the .dts changes all go through arm-soc.
