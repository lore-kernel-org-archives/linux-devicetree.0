Everyone else who is adding DT support does it so that one can boot
the same kernel using ATAG or DT mode, to allow testing in direct
comparison for the transitional period. Further, you can currently
build a single kernel that supports all board files including DT
support, with this patch you have to build two separate kernels,
which I consider a regression.

I guess this would be ok if you plan to remove the non-DT board files
from mach-mmp soon (e.g. v3.6) and only support DT booting, providing
the same feature set as today with the board files. If you think you
need longer than that, I would prefer if you make the two options
coexist in the kernel.
