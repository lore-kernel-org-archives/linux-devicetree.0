It does not apply because my driver ("sun8i-codec") is, currently, not 
available in your fix/sunxi branch:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git/tree/sound/soc/sunxi?h=fix/sunxi

Should I apply the patches (which add my driver) as "dependencies" and 
indicate it in my cover letter? Let me know what I should do.

Thank you for the help!
