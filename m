So looking through the patches, you are going to need to modify the rtc
driver and the platform code in the same patch at least once since you
are changing the interface. You could break the patches down like this:

1) Move the rtc detection from the orion5x board to the rtc driver.
   This adds the detection support for the ep93xx board also.

2) Replace the board read/write ops structure with ioremapped regions.

3) Add the device tree bindings to the rtc driver.

The first two patches could be combined, but will touch both the rtc
driver and the platform code, and do the prep work needed for adding the
dt bindings. The third patch can then stand on its own, and more clearly
just adds the dt bindings.
