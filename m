Yeah.

So I have a new version of the patchset in which that is implemented as
you are describing.  Fortunately, the differences are limited to patches #2,
#3 (for the "compatible" property to behave this way too) and #9 and are not
too big.

I'd prefer that to pass the Mika's tests before posting it, though, which will
take some time I suppose.
