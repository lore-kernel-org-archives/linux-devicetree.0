There will be much more overhead drawn by frequent DMA transfers.
I believe you understand the idea -- less burst size then more DMA
request. Each DMA transfer contains a pair of handshaking overhead
according to the bus protocol. Apparently the bus will be wasted
with lots of handshaking section instead of keep dedicated to data
transfer truly. It might work if SSI is the only user of the bus,
which we shouldn't assume.
