regulator: mc34708: Add driver?

I ommitted the mc34708 part because it's a new driver

The reason for this wrapping stuff is that this is not a standalone 
driver, rather a "subdriver" of the mc13xxx MFD driver.
That already exists and supports the mc34708 (for the RTC for example) 
but not yet the regulator parts.
It does not expose regmap (although it does use it internally).

You are referring to the fact that the "val" parameter in my function is 
the non shifted value?
I think this makes the call sites much cleaner.
I get your point about it having the same name but different semantics 
as other functions though.
Would you be happier if I rename this to mc34708_set_bitfield() for example?

The purpose of this function is to read a number of bits from the 
hardware and convert this to a hardware mode based on a lookup table.
The size of this lookup table should encompase all the possible values 
read from that bitfield.
Hence a hardware error alone won't trigger this unless the table size 
itself is wrong (a code BUG, not a hardware error).

I could change the check to use the mask though, rather than the value 
read from hardware to make this clearer.

The mode code is indeed complicated, but mostly because the hardware 
doesn't map directly nor orthogonally to the regulator framework concepts.

I tried to explain this in the block comments at the start of each the 
code for each type of regulator.
Looks like I failed :(

For the switching regulators:
There is a  4 bit "mode" field (which I call hwmode to distinguish from 
the regulator framework concept of mode.
This field encodes:
* The enable / disable state when the standby signal is not asserted 
(there is no seperate enable bit)
* The enable / disable state when the standby signal is not asserted
* The operating mode when the standby signal is asserted
* The operating mode when the standby signal is not asserted

Not all of the 16 possible values are valid. There is no documented or 
discernable direct mapping of the individual bits.

For the LDO regulators:
There is a dedicated enable bit (ouf)
There are 2 bits (VxMode, VxSTBY) controlling the regulator operating 
mode when the standaby signal is or is not asserted. However these bits 
are not seperate.
 From the comment block:

  *    VxMODE    VxSTBY        Normal    Standby
  *    0    0        ON    ON
  *    0    1        ON    OFF
  *    1    0        LP    LP
  *    1    1        ON    LP
  *

So, the function above takes the desired regulator modes for the normal 
and standby states (or 0 for off) and finds the corresponding hwmode 
(value to write to the register bits).

Then the way I handle all this is just use mc34708_sw_find_hw_mode_sel() 
to recalculate the hardware mode by walking the tables every time 
something needs to change.
The table is different depending on the regulator type.

This turned out to be *much* simpler that the initial open code approach 
I first tried.

We need to store the desired modes (for normal and standby state) since 
.set_mode() and .set_suspend_mode() are not always called before 
enable() / disable().
For example, for a .enable() on a switching regulator requires the 
desired normal and standby mode to be known (to find the appropriate 
value for the hardware mode bits since there is no hardware enable bit.
I try to determine the current mode at startup to initialise the desired 
mode for a later enable by reading the registers but that is only 
possible if the regulator is already enabled.
The hardware has no concept of "disabled but will be in PFM mode when 
enabled" for example.

It's not a noop.

If .set_suspend_disable() is called then later .set_suspend_enable() the 
regulator needs to be recofigured.
Note that neither .set_suspend_enable(), nor .set_suspend_disable() 
change the stored modes (req_mode_normal, req_mode_standby) since the 
regulator framework seperates the concept of enable and mode but this 
hardware does not.

Ok
