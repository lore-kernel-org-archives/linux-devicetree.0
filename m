Hi Mike,

Unfortunately, I don't have either (on this part at least).

I do agree with you on the one software clock per hardware clock
thing. It's definitely something we need to work on, and we want to
fit in that model.

The MMC clock tree, from what I understood is actually composed of 3
clocks.

  - The MMC clock that we have support for right now, which is a basic
    factor clock. This clock has three outputs:
      * The clock that goes to the SD card itself.
      * an "output" clock
      * and a "sample" clock

The output and sample clocks are used to output/sample the
commands/response/data that are exchanged with the SD card and are the
one we change the phase of.

The only thing that remains to be understood is what the values we put
there are. The only indication that we have is that a value of 0 means
a phase of 180=B0, which is why we're stalled on this.
