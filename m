I was referring here to the old clock system.

Because a driver drives an IP that is fed by a specific clock, and
those clocks entirely change from one controller to the other, and
=66rom one SoC to the other.

So we were in a situation where you had to write that clock driver
before doing something useful, and then debug because obviously it was
not written properly. This is not acceptable.

Old clks. I was under the impression that you were advocating against
sunxi-ng here, and your patches were using the old system. Sorry if I
mixed things up. Obviously, that wouldn't happen with SCPI.

Well, it might just be because "dealing with clocks is hard"? And you
would have to reimplement at least part of it anyway.

Then add the interface. We do that on a regular basis, and Mike and
Stephen are usually open to it if it's relevant.

For all clock rates that are possible on MMC? With DDR? I seriously
doubt this will be stupid.

Being a fixed clock doesn't help. We had the issue in the past where
we actually had to change those rates to have DMA working (A31's AHB),
or simply because the rate was bad (A13's pll5). A fixed clock removes
that possibility. However, a clock properly modelled can.

Which doesn't mean that we would change it (and we don't!).

Yeah, ignoring 95% of the problem is usually a very efficient way to
simplify it. Now, throw the audio clocks, the pixel clocks, the SPI
clocks, the camera clocks, the GPU clocks. Had some frequency change
for all of them, with some weird frequencies for the pixel clocks to
deal with all the panels out there, and see how it goes.

For example, during the A13 DRM development, we had to support
changing from TV-out to the panel output. In order to generate the
right frequencies, we had to change the rate of 4 clocks with a direct
relationship, and try to come up with a combination of these four
clocks that would generate the right frequency.

This is trivial with the CCF. Yes, it's complex, but the complexity is
here for a reason. Otherwise no-one would use it (yet everyone does).

Debian Jessie has a package with U-Boot 2014.10. I don't even know how
they can install it, since there's no generic way to do it.

Fedora, Arch, Gentoo don't have a package.
OpenWRT is made to run on whatever bootloader comes on the board.

So no, really, they don't.

And on NAND? SPI-NOR? And on which MMC card would you install it?

Judging from the past experience, in 4 years, we haven't been able to
complete a single clock tree. And by complete, I mean with all the
clocks defined, and tested properly. This will be much easier with
sunxi-ng, but really, don't count on having everything that works
after a short while.

Even if you have all the clocks exposed quite soon, we don't have any
driver to test them.

So what you suggest is to actually upgrade the bootloader each time,
for the foreseeable future. And that alone is a showstopper.

I don't need to upgrade my BIOS or UEFI on my PC everytime I get a new
kernel release to have everything working as it should.

And I'm guessing both ThunderX and Seattle had an army of engineers
working on that firmware, and testing every last bit of it.

If we also had such a firmware, I would be all in. But we don't, and
we can't in a reasonable (less than a month) timeframe. It really
boils down to this. This has been stalled for something like 6 monthes
now, waiting for solutions that might or might not happen (and I know
I have my share of responsibilities in this). But I don't want to wait
any longer.

I consider my firmware just like you consider your DT: I really like
the fact that I can go with _one_ known best firmware.

I'm more pessimistic than you are on this, but even with that
assumption, the point still holds: you cannot support all the clocks
=66rom day one.

Like I said, this is not true.

And I want something that works *today*, not some blurry thing that
redhat, fedora and debian might or might not help us with at some
point in a vague future.

U-boot configuration is mostly static. The video modes are always the
same. You don't have to do any arbitration between devices. You don't
have audio. It's totally fine for a firmware, but you need something
more advanced in the kernel.

I understand the need for ARM to find a technical showcase
platform. What I don't understand is why I should feel the pain of
going against the current, and waiting for suffering to (maybe) stop
at some point in the future.

That goal is very noble. I'm under the impression that it's the kind
of soft-lobbying that Marc wanted to do with PSCI too, that we were
basically the first one to implement. And it worked for us because it
worked from day one, and it was an all or nothing.

What you suggest is an entire different story.

Please speak to the vendors, make them provide those firmwares. I'll
be more than happy to switch to them then.
