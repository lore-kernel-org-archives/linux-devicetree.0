Thanks.  I think this is cleaner too.

I am and to change the brightness, but it won't work and pre-released
hardware, because the PWM pins moved around.  The schematic needs to
be 1015171 (15 March 2010), Rev A or newer.  I don't believe the older
versions were released to the public outside Logic PD or TI, but a lot
of that is before my time.  This patch should be the released
hardware.

The changes between the beta release and Rev A include:

Corrected connection of GND_PACK to U32
Connected AXR15 / EPWM0TZ[0] / ECAP2_APWM2 / GP0[7] to J2.99 and U25.46
Added R216-R221, Q10-Q11
Added SPI1_SCS[0] /EPWM1B/GP2[14] /TM64P3_IN12 to J3.36

I will look that up. Thanks
