OK, I'll fix that in a follow-up. as mentioned in the other thread:
can you confirm that the PHY ID is 0x00221620?
It seems that I also broke meson-gxbb-nexbox-a95x.dts with that series
(no idea why that slipped through): according to the photos from
Neil's wiki [0] this seems to use an IC+ 10/100 ethernet PHY (probably
an IP101A)

indeed, that seems to be a problem.
the GXBB Nexbox A95x I mentioned above is based on the p201 board.
Amlogic's .dts also toggles GPIOZ_14 for it: [1]
chances are high that it also features an IP101A PHY (this is pure
speculation though).

I propose four patches to fix all this situation:
- add the GPIOZ_14 reset and an ethernet_phy0 (with reg = <0>) to
meson-gxbb-nexbox-a95x.dts
- add the ethernet_phy0 node with reg = <0> (and ideally I also want
to include the KSZ9031 PHY ID) to meson-gxbb-p200.dtsi along with
phy-mode = "rgmii"
- add the ethernet_phy0 node with reg = <0> (without any PHY ID as we
don't know which one is used) to meson-gxbb-p201.dtsi along with
phy-mode = "rgmii"
- remove "phy-mode" and ethernet_phy0 from meson-gxbb-p20x.dtsi and
add a comment that both, the RGMII and the RMII PHY have GPIOZ_14
connected to their reset line

does that make sense?

Martin
