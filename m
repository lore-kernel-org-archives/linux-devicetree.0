Well, sounds like a fatal error. Did you ever saw it? If that happens
frequently, or even once, the device/system seems not really usable.

The interrupt handler may run as thread, e.g. if the -rt patch has been
applied. Therefore it's safer to use the irqsave/restore variants of the
spin_lock functions. At least that's my understanding. See also
"Documentation/spinlock.txt".

How did your trigger that sequence? Short-circuit or not cable
connected? The latter, I assume, as bus-off is not reached.

This is most probably an ack slot bus error similar to. You seem not to
handle bus errors and it's not a controller problem as the state did not
change.

OK, a state change to error passive. The device seems not to report
changes to error warning.

State changes should be reported only once. But it did not change. This
is then a bus error (CAN_ERR_PROT | CAN_ERR_BUSERROR). See also above.

Also a sequence to bus-off including the recovery would be nice.
