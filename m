This patch series adds support for QualComm ICE driver which
is embedded in storage device such as UFS/eMMC.

ICE HW provides high throughputs, which meets the line speed
of storage devices. ICE works in bypass or non-bypass mode,
during bypass mode ICE does not perform any crypto operations
but in non-bypass mode ICE will perform encryption/decryption
based on the configuration.

ICE HW supports AES128/256 bit ECB & XTS mode algorithms, which
is used on many SoCs like msm8916, msm8996, msm8953, sdm845 and
many more MTPs from QualComm.

Also adds new functions to firmware driver which are needed to
request secure OS to restore ICE key config when device reset.

These patches have been tested on sdm845 MTP using some additional
patches (a) interconnect changes (b) ufs-ice interface driver
(c) dtsi changes for device init (d) kernel config changes. Once
these patches are accepted rest will be posted.
