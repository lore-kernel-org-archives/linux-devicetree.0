Actually, you are attaching too much meaning to this one. pci_register_=
io_range()
only tries to remember the ranges, nothing else. And it *does* check th=
at the
total sum of registered ranges does not exceed IO_SPACE_LIMIT. This is =
used before
we have any resource mapped for that range (actually it is used to *cre=
ate* the
resource for the range) so there is no other helping hand.

It doesn't assume that space starts at bus address zero, it ignores the=
 bus address.
It only handles CPU addresses for the range, to help with generating lo=
gical IO ports.
If you have overlapping CPU addresses with different bus addresses it w=
ill not work,
but then I guess you will have different problems then.

Yes, because this one does the actual allocation. And it needs to know =
how
the mapping from CPU to bus works.

I agree, but I think the two functions serve two different and distinct=
 roles.
