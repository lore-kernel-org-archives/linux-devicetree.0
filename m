I think this will conflict the gmac alias defined in sun7i-a20.dtsi:

aliases {
     ethernet0 = &gmac;

STAT led is on the SOM204 module, while led1/2 on the EVB. Thats why 
they have
different prefix.

RTL8723BS is comblo WiFI/BT module. There is separate reset control for 
each of the
systems.

The bus is exposed to one of the connectors (UEXT2). Same for SPI1/2 and
