Ok, we are talking about 2 renames,
1. ARCH_VULCAN -> ARCH_THUNDER2,  please see below, but I think there is
board agreement on steps:
  - add ARCH_THUNDER2 in a patchset in a dev cycle
  - when it is mainline, replace ARCH_VULCAN with ARCH_THUNDER2 in the
    next cycle for drivers

2.  boot/dts/broadcom/vulcan* -> boot/dts/cavium/thunder-99* 
If I understand correctly, the main sticking point here is the
duplication of the dtsi file for SoC, instead of just including
vulcan.dtsi in thunder-99xx board file.

It is not so bad in my view to have the duplication in a kernel version
until vulcan is removed. I think you would prefer something like this:
  - have a patchset in this dev cycle to include vulcan.dtsi in
    thunder-99xx.dts (the 99xx name to match 88xx already there)
  - patchset in an upcoming dev cycle to:
     * remove ARCH_VULCAN
     * move vulcan.dtsi -> thunder-99xx.dtsi, drop vulcan ids which are
       removed.

This seems reasonable to me, I will send out a patch to do this (if you
do not have any further comments)

Doing it in a single patch has to be acked by 3 maintainers, and
merged thru the arm-soc tree.

The simpler solution is to change these in 3 different patches, and
then remove ARCH_VULCAN Kconfig entry and defconfig entry when all
the references in the tree is gone.

The board, SoC, and cpu compat strings will go away with the platform,
so I did not add them here. With the updated plan above, I think we can
take care of this while deleting vulcan.

There is no plan to change compat properties in drivers, we can add
cavium compat properties when necessary. PMU is a slightly special
case, but we can be compatible with vulcan there too, until things
change.

Thanks,
JC.
