This patch has been sent out for review previously [1]; So I refered
other platforms and changed to only enable apb bus clock due I have
not found timer enabling bits in Hi6220's spec.

Yes, it can work well even I don't enable any timer clock. I will
check furthermore in spec to see if can bind with formal way as your
suggestion.
