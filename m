I only warn and make sure people are aware of the issue. I leave that
up to platform maintainers to decide. It depends on the maturity of
the platform and users. If people complain about it then it's their
mess. For platforms supported in distros such as debian or fedora, I
would strongly recommend against breaking compatibility. They do ship
dtbs, but it's a chicken and egg problem. If dtbs were stable and
provided by firmware, then they wouldn't have to provide them. If dtbs
are unstable, then they have no choice.

It can go in with subsystem maintainers ack, but there are problems
with this one regardless of compatibility.

Removing a compatible name or not has nothing to do with sharing code.

The name is removed, but remains here?
