You still haven't answered the comments I made on your v5. To me, this
does not represent how the controller and chip pins are connected, but
how the chip was programmed and which endianness should be used by the
controller to correctly read the data back. Maybe I'm wrong, hence my
question.

Nope, you can't refer to linux-specific config options in a DT binding,
because those bindings are supposed to be OS-agnostic. Maybe something
like "If this property is missing, the endianness is chosen by the
system (potentially based on extra configuration options).".

Rob, any suggestion other suggestion?

Boris
