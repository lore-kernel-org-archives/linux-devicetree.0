That was only an example.

You could just define the memory controller node and use it directly by
cpuidle for now. If or when you need to support multiple users, then the
kernel can be updated to have some intermediate MFD or memory controller
driver. You just don't want to be changing the DTS when that happens.
Hardcoding it is what we have now, so it's not any worse and would be
acceptable.
