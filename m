Will do, thanks

OK, Same here

As Mark Brown pointed out, I would prefer to leave this as a reference to 
a register in the device. In general I was hoping to keep the original 
platform data names as carried over to dt.

I'll be more specific, Thanks

I will explain values better, Thanks

This is set based on the system design so it usually will be a one time 
setting at boot.

I'll send a v2 shortly,

Thank you for the review and tips for the next ones.
