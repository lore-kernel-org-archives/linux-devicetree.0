That's not how it works.  It's helpful, more often than not, to submit
the entire set to each maintainer concerned so they can keep up with
the general conversation.  By only sending specific patches to
maintainers you essentially blinker them to the bigger picture.

As a maintainer you should _know_ that you can't apply patches from
other subsystems without appropriate Acks.  I'm sure you'd take
exception to another maintainer who started accepting patches for
subsystems you are responsible for.  This works both ways.
