Yes, this sounds like a good idea.

I think the important point for you to realize is that you don't need to
worry about breaking a specific SoC. The patches will come from someone
who is using that hardware in the end. What we need from clock{source,event}
subsystem maintainers is perspective of how things fit into the subsystem
and to provide review like:
- this driver is not using CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE when it should
- that driver only handles clockevent, don't put it into drivers/clocksource
- I don't like your coding style, it doesn't fit in with the other
  drivers in this subsystem.
- what you do can be implemented much simpler using the generic infrastructure
  introduced by that earlier driver.
