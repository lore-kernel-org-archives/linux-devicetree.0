I'm not saying that it has to match the physical device fitted - I'm
merely suggesting not using nxp,tda1998x which could (and as Sebastian
has found, does) conflict with other devices with different properties.

We still auto-detect the exact device type by reading the ID register
because that's the most reliable way to detect exactly what kind of
device is fitted to the board.
