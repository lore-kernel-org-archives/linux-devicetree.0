Like other commenters I'm rather like using C to solve this, and your
comments Big Upfront Design are good backup in term of convincing me.

I'm also interested in the "what about ACPI" question?

Using C makes describing a board in ACPI fairly easy. AFAICT allocating
IDs to a board rather than its included components is fairly natural for
ACPI.

However I'm too ignorant to be able to figure out if the expansion
connector itself could/should be described in the tables (e.g. if
connector is a bus and the board is[1] a device, could the bus driver
be instantiated in a reasonable way).

[1] ... or becomes a device, based on feedback in this thread ;-)
