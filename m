Thanks everyone for the feedback!

Bjorn, you can drop this patch from the series if you want to add it to
your tree, and the host bridge drivers will have to reimplement pci_sca=
n_root_bus()
for now (most do it already as they need to add msi information as well=
).

Benjamin, I still have on my ToDo list to convert powerpc. I might not =
be
able to do it successfully on my own (as I don't understand a lot of th=
e
corner cases) but Bjorn is correct here in that pcibios_reserve_legacy_=
regions()
will move out of the scanning of the root bus.

I know :)
