I think either works - with DAIs there is a tendency (though not
universal) for devices to just have numbered interfaces which makes the
numbers more natural.  I'm more concerned with the binding being legible
than with what ends up physically written in there, the original reason
for strings (apart from the fact that they're in the drivers already)
was that there was a lot of resistance in the DT community to symbolic
constants.  That would have lead to bindings which looked like line
noise.

The complexity there comes from the device that's being used rather than
the design of the sound card though - the fact that a SoC has an audio
block with many DAIs shouldn't prevent it using the simple bindings if
someone just hung a simple CODEC off one of the DAIs.
