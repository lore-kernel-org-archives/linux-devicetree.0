The *call* is there in the regulator subsystem, it's just that none of
the drivers back it up with an actual implementation yet.  Which turns
out to be a good thing as cpufreq can't currently understand variable
latencies and the governors don't deal well with non-trivial latencies
anyway.

The problem with device tree is that once you've defined a binding
you're stuck with it, it's very hard to change - witness all the magic
number based stuff with the interrupt bindings for example
