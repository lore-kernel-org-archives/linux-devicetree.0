I also requested to take the restructure patches through ARM tree. They
are only touching files in drivers/clk/mvebu and by taking them through
ARM, we can update PCIe clock patches easily. The dependency between
Thomas' and my patches basically is that I renamed files that Thomas
now commits to. (I switched clk/mvebu from per-function files to per-soc
files).
