Presumably that's just because nobody has ported the code; it could be
supported couldn't it?

That seems reasonable to me, although people will complain about the
files moving again. Perhaps it's worth doing that as part of the move of
*.dts out of the kernel?

sub-arch being the mach-xxx/plat-xxx directory? If so, I think that's a
Linux-ism that shouldn't affect the DT directory layout.
