The serial adds power management support for MXS PHY, it includes:

- Add one PHY API .set_wakeup, and related API implementation at mxs phy driver
- misc changes and bug fixes for mxs phy to support low power mode and wakeup.

It is based on the lastest Greg's usb-next, 3.14-rc3.

Changes for v11:
- Change the descrition of adding compatible string, and
  add mention that "fsl,imx23-usbphy" is still a fallback
  for other strings. [1/15]

Changes for v10:
- Nothing related with function change.
- It adds dt maintainers to To list, and cc devicetree@vger.kernel.org,
wait dt-maintainer's ack for 1/15, 4/15.
- Add last three dts patches for reference which have already
at Shawn's tree.

Changes for v9:
- Fix the build warning if CONFIG_SUSPEND is not set

Changes for v8:
- Shawn has already applied two dts patches, so delete them at
  v8 version, http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=138785188404939&w=2
- Using of_get_property to avoid imx6 fail at probe when using old DTB [5/12]
- Do not consider failure if alias id is not existed, it can avoid fail
  at probe when using old DTB [8/12]
- We don't need more changes for [8/12] change due to we use
  "mxs_phy->port_id ==" as condition

Changes for v7:
- Fixed indentation problem at binding doc [1/14]
- s/ganranteed/guaranteed, and add explanation for "auto setting" [3/14]
- add static before SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS [13/14]
- add one patch to change usb device description [7/14]
- Delete the .nofity_suspend and .notify_resume due to Felipe
  does not agree to add them as PHY API, will use other ways to implement
  them in future.

Changes for v6:
- Add description for IC bug fixes logic. [9/15]
- Move is_imx6q_phy and is_imx6sl_phy from [9/15] to [14/15] 
- %s/mxs_phy_clock_switch/mxs_phy_clock_switch_delay to reflect
the function meaning more precise [15/15]

Changes for v5:
Add Marc and Michael Grzeschik's commnets
- typo error at [2/15]
- sqhash patches which introducing mxs_phy_disconnect_line and
fixed but at this function. [13/15]
- Introducing flag MXS_PHY_NEED_IP_FIX who stands for the SoCs
who have IC fixes. [2/15, 8/15]
- Delete one patch for low speed connection problem at every rare
situations due to the root cause has still not found.
