- Allwinner's video driver is not DRM.
- their driver has no hardware cursor nor video overlay.
- I wrote the video DRM driver from the document
	Allwinner_H3_Datasheet_V1.2.pdf
  and the structures defined in
linux-3.4/drivers/video/sunxi/disp2/disp/de/lowlevel_sun8iw7/de_rtmx.h
  Reading Allwinner's code helped me to understand how the DE2
  is working.
- my lowlevel HDMI is just a cleanup of theirs with explanations
  about the registers. Magic constants remain due to the lack of
  knowledge about the PHYs.
- the mention of Allwinner in the copyright headers is needed to
  indicate the source of the structures (DE2) and code (HDMI).

The main difference is the DRM interface and the use of the EDID,
permitting dynamic video resolution change with xrandr.
