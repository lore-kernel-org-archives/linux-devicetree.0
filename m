So you are not sure if imx6ul-isiot-common.dtsi will be used by carrier
board.  Then what's the point to have it now?

You are saying imx6ul-isiot-common.dtsi is created to accommodate the
common things across emmc and nand SoMs, but it actually contains LCD
and Touch such base-board level of stuff.  Confusing.

I feel the abstraction is wrong from the beginning.  Ideally, we should
have something like below.

 - imx6ul-isiot.dtsi
 - imx6ul-isiot-kit.dts and imx6ul-isiot-carrier.dts

The -isiot should have everything on SoM and common stuff between -kit
and -carrier boards, while -kit and -carrier include -isiot and contains
the base-board specific things.  The -isiot can have both emmc and nand
devices with "disabled" status, and let firmware turn device on per SoM
it boots.  In that case, the abstraction level can be less and clearer.

Thoughts?
