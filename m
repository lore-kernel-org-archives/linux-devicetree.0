And before we go down that route, let me point out that the 'amba bus'
stuff in the kernel is there to support primecells, rather than all
devices which the AMBA specification covers.

The reason it's called 'amba' is because back in 2001 or so when the
first primecell drivers were created, there was little information
available as to what AMBA, AHB, or APB even covered.  All I had to go
on were the primecell documents themselves.  The higher level documents
were not available to me.

So, despite it being called 'amba', it really is just for primecells
and if we didn't have the exposure to userspace, I'd have renamed it to
'apb' or similar instead.
