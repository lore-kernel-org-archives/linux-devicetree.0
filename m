   I have at least created my HyperBus driver and unfortunately I'm having serious
issues with the design of the support core (see below)...

   Hm, I doubt that the HB devices are wholly mapped into memory space, that seems
like a property of the HB controller. In my case, the flash device in the DT has
only single-cell "reg" prop (equal to the chip select #). Then this function returns 
-EINVAL and the registration fails. Also, in my case such mapping is R/O, not R/W.

   Again, I doubt that this should be done here, and not in the HB controller driver...
