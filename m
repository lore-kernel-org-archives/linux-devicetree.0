I think it is also a good idea to expose register values to debugfs,
so we can easily check what is really written into internal registers.

Does "does not turn on" mean you cannot measure any clock on the
output or is it just a guess because audio does not play?

It could be that we just need to add some delay when we enable a clock
output. Datasheet just says 10us max from OEB pin pulled low to valid
clock output - not exactly what we are looking for but it could be a
good start.

What I noticed when adding the pll reset and checking DEVICE_STATUS is
that SYS_INIT is still set. According to the datasheet, the meaning of
the bit is that si5351 is still copying NVM content to its internal
registers and therefore, we shouldn't try to access them.

What really irritates me about it is that it is seconds after power-up
and copying the contents shouldn't really take _that_ long. However,
the datasheet does not mention anything about how long it may take.
