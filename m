What's wrong with using ${device}.{physical_address} as the PMU name?
That would be unique and consistent regardless of the firmware, no
mapping nor index property necessary.

That's sufficient for any user already familiar with the topology, a
familiarity you seem to be assuming regardless by not explicitly
describing the topology in the DT.

Thanks,
Mark.
