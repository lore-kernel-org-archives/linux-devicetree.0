Will see that later on :)

Please tell me whether I'm wrong but for am335x/am437x both DMA Channels and
events are given by DT. I believe IP Spec provides the mapping for the channel
(this is what you call fixed channel) and DMA router event is selected randomly
within the DT.
As for dra7 events comes from DT but channel is selected though out local
algorithm. IP Spec defines DMA event muxer mapping.

At my opinion my router is more closed to dra7. IP Spec defines event mapping.
Nonetheless the DMA has a fixed allocated mapping. Using DMA alone DT has to
provide channel number. In router mode this number doesn't matter since router
makes the routing from fixed event to channel. However router needs to know
which channel will be assign to event: any random channel is allowed.

I'm pretty sure I can mimic what has been for DRA7 related to DMA Channel
allocation however it seems to be this is aside DMA engine. This kind of
implementation forbid the use of DMA and DMA router at the same time : I
remember you already raise the point. If a DMA channel is requested DMA router
is not aware of this allocation. This is the idea of my custom API which relies
on get_any_slave_channel().
Using DT to assign channel seems not a good idea either as I lost router's benefice.

BTW I need the channel ID within router.
Looking at core or of_dma_router_xlate() I don't really know how to do it a
generic manner.

Ideas are welcomed
