So given all the possible caveats, I think we :

1) Shouldn't enable the driver by default at runtime even if it is built-in.
2) Should provide mechanisms to turn it on at boot (via kernel commandline)
    or anytime later (via sysfs), which kind of puts the responsibility back on
    the user : "You know what you are doing".
3) Shouldn't turn the driver on based on "nohlt" which the user could use it for
    some other purposes, without explicit intention of turning this driver on).
4) Should document the fact that, on some platforms, the user may have to disable
    CPUidle explicitly to get the driver working. But let us not make it the default.
    The user with a not so ideal platform could add "nohlt" and get it working.
