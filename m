In commit 8e4947ee477d ("arm64: dts: qcom: sdm845: Add I2C, SPI, and
UART9 nodes") I accidentally forgot to add the line:

  status = "disabled";

to qupv3_id_0 to match qupv3_id_1.  Add it now.  NOTE: right now the
only sdm845 board with a device tree in mainline is MTP and that board
currently doesn't have any peripherals under qupv3_id_0.  If any board
was currently using peripherals under qupv3_id_0 then that board would
need to add this snippet to their board dts file:

  &qupv3_id_0 {
     status = "okay";
  };
