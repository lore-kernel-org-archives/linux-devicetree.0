In general, bindings focus on the hardware and hardware configuration
instead of what Linux needs internally.  For a lot of interrupt
controllers, an irq specifier consists of two u32 values.  The first
value being the hardware irq number (perhaps 0-15 in this case), and
the second value being a set of flags.

Without looking deeply and the GIC interface details, I suspect that
the CPU affinity would best be represented as a field in the flags
value.

The per-CPU PMU connections then wouldn't be any different from any
other irq in that the irq specifier would include a CPU affinity
value.

Yup, and that is exactly what is done.  On powerpc it uses the virtual
irq infrastructure.  For ARM and everyone else, there are patches on
list for irq_domain which implements the required behaviour.  The
interrupt controller driver can make decisions about how to map the
hardware irq to a linux irq number.  For most irq controllers, it will
be a simple 1:1 mapping, but for something complex like the gic, it
can do something different if need be.

Actually, it turns out not to be.  We've been needing/wanting some
form of irq_domains anyway for a while now to better manage hwirq ->
linuxirq mappings.  Adding DT to the mix means also suppling a DT
decode function to get the hwirq number from the interrupt specifier.

I'll be reposting a bunch of patches in the next few days that fills
in most of the missing pieces for irq mapping.
