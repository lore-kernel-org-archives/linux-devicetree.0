So we should at least have something that represents that single wire
connection in DT since it might not be there and so that the kernel can
make sure that both devices agree if they're synced or not and can
disable the sync if it's been enabled in error (if one of the devices
is off, you seemed to be saying that might cause problems).

It's not clear to me when it'd make sense to disable these from a system
integration point of view.

It feels like if this is going to be user controllable the UI needs to
be pulled up a level to be something like an on/off switch for the sync
rather than a series of magic _EXT controls on the individual CODECs.
Even if it is magic _EXT controls having them being per device feels
wrong.
