Yes I was referring to the A31. In the A23 SDK, sun8iw1 refers to A31.
As for the PM pins, the A31 EVB fex file uses one PM pin for LCD backlight
control. And don't take my word for it. A31 standard design schematics from
Omilex clearly show PL/PM pins with the possible functions on the top left of
page 7. See:

I'm not sure I understand. The clock gate and reset control are still separate,
are they not?

Thank you for bringing this up. I went through the code and updated
these bits on the wiki. The CPU power clamps are interleaved throughout
the PRCM registers :(
