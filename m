Boris,

Thanks for posting this series.  Bear with me as I'm attempting to give
MikeT a hand.  Don't be afraid to tell me a question is stupid :-)

I think we need to be more explicit in the binding and the API,
especially when providing a method to recalculate the accuracy.  I
presume this recalculated value would be relative against the root
clock?

There really needs to be two attributes here:  the rated accuracy from
the manufacturer, and the calculated accuracy wrt another clock in the
system.  We only need a binding for the manufacturer rating since the
calculated accuracy is determined at runtime.

I would also prefer to see an unknown accuracy be -1.  There are already
clocks on the market (PPS reference clocks) with accuracies of
0.1ppb/day [1].  Obviously, these aren't system clocks.  So the limit on
accuracy may be a non-issue.  However, it may be worth changing the
binding property to express the units.

I would prefer to call this property 'clock-rated-ppb'.
