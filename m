I have some passing familiarity with ASoC...  if you look at newer
drivers, especially those for DT systems, you'll see that we're
transitioning CODEC drivers to use the clock API for their clocks since
this makes integrating with both generic ASoC things like simple card
and non-ASoC clocks.

That's going to be an issue no matter where you put the control - the
ASoC specific clocking APIs don't have any control here either.  I don't
know if we want to add the functionality for doing very fine grained
adjustments into the clock API or not (the use cases seem limited though
I'm sure they exist), though I do think we should have that discussion
if only to confirm, but that's a separate thing to how we expose any
userspace control - the clock API is a kernel internal thing.
