Right, I do not know which tree you are using, but the usb_power_supply support
for the axp221 / axp223 has not landed upstream yet, nor is it in
linux-sunxi/sunxi-next. The patches have been accepted by lee, but he has not
yet pushed them to next.

For now you can try:

https://github.com/jwrdegoede/linux-sunxi/commits/sunxi-wip

Which has all the necessary commits.

With that kernel tree the "usb0_vbus_power-supply = <&usb_power_suply>;"
should work, and all necessary bits are on their way to next,
there just not all there yet.

Hans
