We use 10 of the optional aux channels available in the XADC and have them wired 
up to specific power supplies. For example, channel 9 is connected to the 
current of a 6V power supply and channel 12 is connected to the voltage of that 
same supply, channel 4 is connected to the current of a 3.3V power supply and 
channel 5 is connected to its voltage.

Without adding extended names to distinguish these aux channels, the handles 
available inside /sys/bus/iio/devices/[device] are generic: in_voltage10_raw, 
in_voltage10_scale, for example. If I added the label 'user5v_v', then these 
handles would be in_voltage10_user5v_v_raw and in_voltage10_user5v_v_scale. This 
makes it a lot easier to get started and let the handles describe themselves, 
rather than having to look up which channels are connected to which things.

As far as using 'label' instead of 'extend-name', that's fine with me. I've 
already sent out a v2 using 'label' instead.
