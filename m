Hello Rob,

Thanks for your feedback.

Do you mean, removing clk_ prefix ?

Yes, this is not mandatory. This is convenient to identify sai 
controller, as we may have up to 8 instances.
I can make it optional, or remove it if you think it is not relevant.

Right. This needs to be updated as follows:
	sai1b: sai1b@40015824 {
		...
		reg = <0x40015824 0x1C>;
		...
	};

mclk-fs property is required when SAI is configured as master.
It seems that mclk-fs is not supported in current version
of audio graph card. So I thing I should keep simple card for the time 
being. Anyway, I plan further updates for SAI, so I will
have opportunity to change to graph card at that time.
