Um.. well, in a DT based system, the bootloader typically passes the
command line to the kernel via the device tree (it goes in the
bootargs property of /chosen).

However, at least on PowerPC the default console is also specified
directly in the DT (via the linux,stdout-path property in /chosen), so
putting console= on the command line isn't usually necessary (if given
it will override the linux,stdout-path property for most purposes).

Setting linux,stdout-path in the device tree sounds like the right
thing to do here.

Well, typically I wouldn't expect printk() to occur until you're in C
code at least, but I don't know about the ARM code.  Once you're in C
code it shouldn't be significantly harder to consult the device tree
than to parse the command line.

On PowerPC we do have a super-early debug printing mechanism, but when
that's enabled all the specifics are compile-time selected (it's
basically only recommended for use during bringup).
