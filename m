I also don't like the underscores, but they're an unfortunate historical
artifact that we can't get rid of (at least for cpu_on, cpu_off, and
cpu_suspend).

Both Xen and kvmtool are already passing DTs to guests which have
underscores in the property names, so it's both a boot ABI and a
userspace ABI.

One aim with this update is to ensure that the new binding maintains a
level of forward compatibility for OSs -- the PSCI 0.2 binding needs to
be a superset of the existing PSCI binding to allow Xen and KVM to
provide PSCI 0.2 functionality without sacrificing the ability to boot
older guests (kvmtool could be given a flag to choose what version of
PSCI to provide, but I'm not sure that can be done for Xen).

Given that, I'm not sure if it makes sense to force the rest to have
dashes rather than underscores -- it'll leave the binding more
inconsistent.

For the compatibility reasons above, I don't think we can do this. At
least the existing IDs (cpu_on, cpu_off, and cpu_suspend) would need to
be described in the psci node rather than a child.

A 64-bit platform may not have 32-bit call support, and we wouldn't be
able to describe that with a <32 64> property format. As it is valid for
a 64-bit OS to make 32-bit calls, we need to not describe a 32-bit call
ID in that case.

Cheers,
Mark.
