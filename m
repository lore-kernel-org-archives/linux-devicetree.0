Indeed ATM the EVM relies on the bootloader to setup the pin muxing.

I just checked the uart pins routing of the EVM, the dts:
- should reclaim serial2_rxtx_pins and serial2_rtscts_pins
- can reclaim serial1_rxtx_pins (out on Audio connector but very
  unlikely used for audio)
- should leave serial1_rtscts_pins (out on Audio connector but used by
  McASP so used for audio)

Also I think it would be better for the serial nodes to reclaim the rxtx
pins in the dtsi, and override the reclaimed pins in the .dts only for
the nodes reclaiming flow control (some other pins could also be
directly reclaimed in the dtsi).

Some other cleanups would also be in order for the da850*:
- use labels for non dtsi (like I did for the LCDK)
- add chosen,memory nodes (I guess currently only the LCDK can
  dispense with ATAGS)
- use a null range translation in the da850 dtsi for the soc node
  (computing the offsets is error prone and is there a point)

Sure I could fix that, along with some of the above suggestions if you
are ok with it.

Rgds, 
Karl
