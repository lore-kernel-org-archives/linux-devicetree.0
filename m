I think we're pretty close other than some minor comments. I would like
to see ack's from Greg and some reviewed-bys from others. The subsystem
changes are minor and there has been plenty of chance to comment, so I
don't think acks from all subsystems are needed.

Your branch is based on -next. Is there any dependence on something in
-next? I want to get this into -next soon, but need a branch not based
on -next. Please send me a pull request with the collected acks and
minor comments I have addressed.
