But those dependencies are purely "administrative", not technical,
aren't they? As the existing driver worked already with the DT changes,
it's just the listing of the compatible strings in the binding doc that
is missing? IIRC we added those later on in the past already.

So I think it's safe to merge them independently:
"[PATCH v2 1/4] pwm: sun4i: drop unused .has_rdy member" and
"[PATCH v2 2/4] pwm: sun4i: simplify controller mapping" are
PWM fixes and go via Thierry, I guess.

"[PATCH v2 3/4] dt-bindings: pwm: sunxi: add new compatible strings" is
just Documentation of existing behaviour, and independent from 1/4 and 2/4.

"[PATCH v2 4/4] dts: sunxi: A64: Add PWM controllers" just "softly"
depends on the introduction of the compatible strings in 3/4, but has no
real technical dependency. It can go in any time on its own without
breaking the build or functionality.

Or am I too sloppy here?

Cheers,
Andre.
