Currently i modified the can1 DT entry in the  imx6q.dtsi like this:
            flexcan@02090000 { /* CAN1 */
                reg = <0x02090000 0x4000>;
                interrupts = <0 110 0x04>;
                hw-version = <10>;
            };

and the DT entry in the imx6q-sabrelite.dts like this:
            flexcan@02090000 { /* CAN1 */
                compatible = "fsl,imx6q-flexcan", "fsl,p1010-flexcan";
                phy-en-gpio = <&gpio1 4 0>;
                phy-stby-gpio = <&gpio1 2 0>;
                pinctrl-names = "default";
                pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_flexcan1_1>;
            };
if we don't use hw-version entry and use flexcan-v10, do you mean we use 
strcmp or strxxx to decide controller version?

Hui.
