The reset/next pull requests are not merged into the arm-soc tree yet.
I suppose I could retract the pull requests and drop the Gemini reset
patches, if the patches in arm-soc/gemeni/dts are also dropped from
arm-soc/for-next.

I have a slight preference for keeping the DT bindings simple, even if
that means merging the reset controller into the clock driver.
