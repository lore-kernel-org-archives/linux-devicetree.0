Hi Olof, Andreas,

As I finally understand, the real issue here is the usage of the "linux,useable-memory" property that
overrides the reg property that is changed by the bootloader to provide the "real" memory size.

As I understand the mainline U-Boot does it right, and it's a good news, and it seems uEFI need to provide
some specialized memory range aswell, but the vendor U-Boot versions only provide the full memory range here.
It seems obvious that whatever range is provided by u-boot, the first 16MiB should be reserved.

The stress-ng package provides this "stress" command and is used to force the kernel to map more memory
zones, but I also got the issue while running a fully fledged Desktop Environment thanks to the
recently merged DRM driver.
You may not be able to trigger the issue since it seems Amlogic reduces this reserved size on GXL/GXM :
https://github.com/khadas/linux/commit/698df2c6cfbb0d1a9359743208e83517b31da6ce
But it should be confirmed.

Kevin asked me initially to handle this "start of ddr" reserved zone via a reserved-memory entry, but
at that time it seemed a better idea to use "linux,useable-memory", but I recon it may be an error.

I will push a v5 with a supplementary reserved-memory entry and will postpone the boards memory size
fixup for a future DTS cleanup.

Andreas, is this ok for you ?

This issue exists since forever on mainline linux, and even 4.9 has it.
Olof, How could a similar fix go in 4.9 stable ?

Thanks,
Neil
