I disagree, with soldered parts it often is the board has
one of "accelerometer a", "b" or "c", where in the simple case
my suggested i2c-probe-stop-at-first-match property will
just work for a new board by creating a new dtb without needing any
kernel changes, where as your suggested model-string generator
C-code module would need updating.

I think that there is a need for both really.

Interesting this is actually the same direction my thoughts on this
lead me in my reply in the other thread on this started by
Antoine Tenart.

Only difference is that I suggested putting the model-string
generation in the bootloader, so it will just be there when the kernel
boots. But I agree that given things like upgradability having
the model-string generation code in the kernel is better.
