The factory layout has a 6MB JFFS2 for root & uImage (uboot mounts it 
by default) + 1MB miscellany. So the main restriction on kernel size is 
the size of your userland.

The non-DT mainline layout is 1MB JFFS2 for uImage + 7MB rootfs. Which is 
a closer approximation to other devices with a uImage in it's own 
partition.

My line of thinking was that the only people that will see this default 
partition scheme are people that have just compiled a mainline kernel and 
booted it to see what happens. At which point you probably still have the 
Netgear image in Flash. If you had OpenWRT in Flash then in all likelihood 
you'd already be using an OpenWRT kernel too, with it's own flash layout. 
Finally, you could have rolled your own userland and put that on Flash, 
but by then you should know enough to do what you like :)
