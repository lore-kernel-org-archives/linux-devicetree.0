i'm not sure if understand correctly for your question; Hikey board
has DDR 1GB@0x0, but there have some memory regions are used for MCU.

So this patch is to reserve these memory regions so that make sure
kernel will not map and allocate them.

Will remove these memory regions from memory node in next version.

Do you mean should remove all reserved memory regions from memory
node? Will submit next version's patch for this.

Kernel can boot successfully on Hikey with this patch [1].

Here use reserved-memory node to remove these regions from memblock
during kernel's boot up; kernel also will not map for them with
property "no-map".

I think this is the same question which have been brought up by Mark
in his early mail and suggested to use UEFI to do this.
