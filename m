I'm not sure what you mean here.

For all the registers if you want to dump all of them. It needs
scripting, it needs root access, and it needs some tool (either devmem
or a custom one) to dump the values. And this is if you have the right
kernel configuration options (devmem enabled, with the protection
against mapped devices disabled).

It just works with debugfs.

Yes.

This is only needed if you want to use caching, and caching is
optional.
