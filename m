Yes it is :)

IMO it is *never* safe for Linux to gate this clock, as you have no idea
on the state of the hardware from the primary and secondary bootloaders.

If the clock is enabled when Linux boots, the Linux clock framework *needs*
to assume the hardware may have been used in previous boot stages, and it should
not attempt to disable the clock.

Your correct there is a visible user, but this is the same as CLK_EXT2F_A9 where
there are multiple users of the clock (SPI, I2C, UART etc).

I think the scope of this flag has been defined in a very narrow way, which is
making you want to suggest lots of hacks in the client driver.

It is not board specific. It is a SoC HW bug, so by definition present on all
boards which have this SoC.

There are other IPs within this IP block for which upstream drivers don't yet exist.

But these drivers are by default built as modules, so when you rmmod, and insmod the
driver you now have an ever increasing clock reference count. This is the
problem I was describing in the previous email, and why what you propose is a
bad idea.

This is exactly what I want to avoid doing. The driver already has these
hacks as it was waiting for the critical clock patches to land so I could remove
them and fix the problem properly.

Much like you did with the I2C and SPI drivers, where you removed similar hacks
and added the clock to the critical clock list.

See above, if the clock is on when Linux boots it can never be assumed that it
is safe to disable it.

As above this is the same for CLK_EXT2F_A9, which has multiple users in the
kernel.

The point is we don't wish to have the knowledge in the individual drivers that
this clock is critical and can destroy the system if it is disabled.

That is not how you are using it currently. See CLK_EXT2F_A9 and
CLK_TX_ICN_DMU.

You didn't need a new flag for that. CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED already allowed you to not
write a specical driver which only handled for example an interconnect clock and
would ensure it wouldn't be gated by the disable_unused logic.

IMO the point of the critical clock stuff, and what CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED *did not* allow
you to do is for situations like CLK_EXT2F_A9, CLK_TX_ICN_DMU and PROC_STFE where users
 *do* exist in the kernel, but the SoC clock driver has *special* knowledge of the
clock tree on the SoC and knows that despite what the drivers are doing with
their enable/disable calls the clock should never be disabled.

In fact out of what we currently mark as clock-critical on STi platform most
of the clocks could have been handled perfectly fine with the CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED
flag (apart from the fact that there is no way to set the flag from DT). It is
only CLK_EXT2F_A9 and CLK_TX_ICN_DMU which *do* have kernel users where the
extra functionality of critical clocks is required (we need the additional
reference taken by the clk framework to avoid the kernel drivers from disabling
the clock).

Peter.
