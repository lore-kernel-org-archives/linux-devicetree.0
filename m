Well yeah, that's fine. But in this case, "sun7i" is the entire group of CPUs 
manufactured by AW. I find that information redundant, the "allwinner,a20-
crypto" would suffice. But I wonder if that IP block might have appeared even 
earlier ? Or if it is CPU family specific, thus "allwinner,sun7i-crypto" would 
be a better string ?
