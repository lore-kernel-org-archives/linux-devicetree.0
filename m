Also agree with Suzuki's excellent summary.

A couple of notes on using EDPRCR....

The logic for this assuming a correctly implemented system should be
something like.....

if (prsr() == powered_down) { // if we are powered down request power up.
    sw_unlock()   // ensure that the sw lock register on the device is unlocked
    write(prcr(bit3=1))
    wait_with_timeout(prsr()==powered_up)   // must wait to see if the
system does power up - otherwise bad things happen!
    if(timed_out)
       fail("power up request for CPU N failed.")  // nothing to do
after this point though if a CPU can't be powered is should not be
included in the list to be checked on crash.
}
ensure_os_lock_unlocked()  // os lock has to be unlocked for bit 0 of
prcr to be writeable.
sw_unlock()   // ensure that the sw lock register on the device is unlocked
write(prcr(bit3=1 | bit0=1)) // the core is powered, set the
nopowerdown request bit so we don't lose it & emulate power down


I think that some of the above logic is already in the driver, so
needs to be adapted for the PRCR handling.


On the "bad" systems, the initial prsr check is likely to fail (crash
/ buslock) if the debug logic is not correctly powered. The user will
then have to use one or more of the PM mitigations previously
discussed that are appropriate for that specific platform and retry
