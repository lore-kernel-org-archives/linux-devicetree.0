In the sample batch (1.2V fixed voltage) the card detect is normal
(PF6 low as inserted), however in the final batch (1.1V/1.3V
switchable) it's inverted at PF6 (high as inserted).

It can operate in OTG -- you can power the board via the OTG port, as
the VBUS is not gated from 5V at all, so 5V power at VBUS will power up 
the
board. Yes, it's a bit unsafe, but the board designer did it.
