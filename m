There is one fundamental difference in that this patch does not require
drivers to be updated (the new flag is only used internally). Which
avoids having to patch every single driver that could possibly be used
in combination with one wanting interrupts during suspend.

Any used which did not explicitly request with IRQF_NO_SUSPEND will not
receive interrupts during suspend.

I can see that we don't want to add more code here to keep things
clean/pure, but I find it hard to believe that a single bit test and
branch (for data that should be hot in the cache) are going to add
measurable latency to a path that does pointer chasing to get to the
irqaction in the first place. I could be wrong though, and I'm happy to
benchmark.

It would be possible to go for your list shuffling approach here while
still keeping the flag internal and all the logic hidden away in
kernel/irq/pm.c. I wasn't sure how actions could be manipulated during
suspend, which made me wary of moving them to a separate list.

I'm not sure I follow. This patch remove the reason we care, no? 

When going for suspend the patch uses the mismatch to detect whether it
needs to mask out any actions for the desc.

If unexpected interrupts can be generated from devices we're masking the
actions for things could go wrong, but that's also the case with the
demux. So if we need the warning here we should also have one in the
demux to that effect...

Thanks,
Mark.
