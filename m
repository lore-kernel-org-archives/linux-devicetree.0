Yes, good point.

Not sure if this is a good rule: As you said, it makes sense to
put the 'ranges' for the devbus-bootcs node into the per-soc .dtsi
file so the board file doesn't have to care. However the mbus code
needs both the 0x012f0000 and the start/length of the child. Mapping
the entire window would work in theory but is likely going to cause
a significant waste of physical address space, because the (per-soc)
ranges property has to be set up for the largest possible external
device connected to the bus, but the mbus window only needs to cover the
device that is actually connected.

I think we have to walk the entire tree of devices underneath mbus,
at least any device node that has a 'reg' property, following children
of any device node with a 'ranges' property. We might need to
add a variant of of_get_address() that does a partial translation
up to a given node (the mbus) instead of all the way to the root.

The PCI-E window would have 'ranges' but no 'regs', so we automatically
skip it.

I suppose we can identify the devices we don't want to reassign by
their compatible values.

You mean keep all windows that are listed by the boot loader but
reassign the others? I guess it would be simpler but may result in
a less optimal address map.
