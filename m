Thanks for the explanation but now I'm a little confused. That's a lot =
of
details and I'm lacking the in depth knowledge to fully understand
everything.

Is it correct to say, that your patch series enables per cpu devices to
be the broadcast device - for PPC?
And that would mean, that even though you have a per cpu device, you'd
deliberately not set the FEAT_PERCPU flag, because on PPC a per cpu
timer is a valid broadcast device?

Assuming that is not going into an utterly wrong direction: How would w=
e
close on this one? AFAIK, ARM does not have this capability and I guess
it won't be added. So, should I go forward with the fix proposed by
Thomas? Should we rename the FEAT_PERCPU flag to something else, given
that PPC may use per cpu devices for broadcasting and the sole usage of
that flag is to prevent such a device from becoming the broadcast devic=
e?

	Thanks,
