Hi Stephen,

Sorry I took so long to reply.

That would be the best. Its easy to wrap up whats in eeprom core to
eeprom_get_cell(dev, "cell-name") for both DT and non-dt cases, if I
remove the nasty global name space thing.

Only thing which is limiting it is the existing bindings which are just 
phandle based. For eeprom to be more of device centric we need more
generic bindings/property names like

nvrom-cell = <&abc>, <&edf>
nvrom-cell-names = "cell1", "cell2";

Also we can have name associated to each eeprom cell which would help 
for non-dt cases. So they can just lookup by the cell name.


Sacha, Are you ok with such binding?  As this can provide a single 
interface for dt and non-dt. I remember you requested for changing from 
generic properties to specific property names.

I agree this is something which I don't like it in the first place too.
If we have something like names associated to each eeprom cell like clks
or regulators we can have some thing like eeprom_get_cell(dev, name);

Yes, it is more of byte oriented. However we can add some new apis for
parsers like ones you are working on.

of_eeprom_get_provider_regmap(phandle) just to get handle to regmap from 
eeprom_core, which would provide most of the apis you would need.
Am guessing eeprom parsers would need need such interface to eeprom-core 
in future anyway.

I though, having "eeprom-cells" would be make sense only if the bindings 
have possible arguments to a phandle. In this case it would be none all 
the time.

For provider lookups currently its generic/easy and fast as its done 
based on eeprom class. Am not sure what advantage would we get
Am I missing anything ?

If you are ok I will prepare a v5 with the proposed changes.
