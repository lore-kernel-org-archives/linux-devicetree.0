Please don't make the same mistake of trivialising this in either
direction.

While we appear to be going in circles, in general there are potentially
valid cases to consider -- there may be system properties/devices that
don't happen to matter to Linux, but are generic, well-defined, and
matter to others. Bindings for those should be considered.

In the absence of any example, as with this thread, there is nothing to
consider, however.

Thanks,
Mark.
