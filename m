I think there is one point that hasn't been made in this discussion. You
seem to assume that an SError should be handled the same way on an ARMv8
system as you handle it on your ARMv7 platform.

In most cases, Linux on ARMv7 runs (for better or worse) in secure mode,
making it the only software agent capable of handling an Asynchronous
Abort. On v8, Linux runs in non-secure mode, and relies on secure
firmware for a large set of platform specific services (PM, CPU
bring-up...). Crucially, error handling is one of these services.

It is largely expected that an SError should be first taken to EL3
(SCR_EL3.EA being set), handled there by any platform-specific FW able
to triage and log the error, and could even be reported to EL1NS via
some standard mechanism. If the FW decides to reinject this SError to
the non-secure side, then this is bound to be fatal, because even the FW
couldn't handle it.

So my view is that you should move that kind of error handling to the
place where it actually belongs. It will give you the opportunity to
print out your debug messages if necessary, and leave the SError
handling in the kernel the way it should be: fatal.

Thanks,
