I have reviewed this series and looks good to me except some comments I
gave and some issues you have identified yourself in patches 25 and 26.

I think this is a good compromise to achieve platform device based
clocks as far as possible with current kernel framework. I know Bartosz
is working on solving the problem generically and I guess once thats
agreed upon, DaVinci can convert too.

But I think this series has been in the works for far too long and
should be merged (the remoteproc dependencies that Bartosz pointed out
should be resolved too). You can wait for clock maintainers opinion
though before spinning another version.

I have not tested this series yet, will do so soon.

Thanks,
Sekhar

PS: I started giving a Reviewed-by: for the mach-davinci patches before
realizing the futility of doing so and stopped mid-way. They will have
my sign-off anyway once I test and merge them.
