This would be a bug in your machine driver then.

If your device is constantly retriggering the same interrupt that
suggests there is a problem with how you are handling your device,
perhaps you need to disable the interrupts at source if it's truly
broken beyond repair.

It sounds like this feature is unusably broken...  possibly you could do
something in the mute handler but it seems that anything you try to do
to use this feature is going to be both fragile and disruptive to the
system.  What is the value in implementing it?
