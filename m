Nothing proposed yet. There was some discussion at Connect (which I
missed part of). We're certainly going to start to have that issue
between arm and arm64 as well as probably FSL powerpc and arm.

I would like to move all dts files out of arch. I think we should think
about how we construct a separate dts repository and then move the
kernel structure in that direction (it's still believed there is too
much interdependency to have separate repo yet). I don't think cpu
architecture is the right top level structure for dts files. Probably
something by vendor and/or SOC family is more appropriate. Then you have
to figure out how to handle board vs. chip vendors.

I think we should stick with defines there.
