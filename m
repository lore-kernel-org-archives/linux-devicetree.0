In an effort to reduce the number of patches, would it be possible to package the DT doc with its
respective driver in one patch?  Or does the DT doc need to be in a patch by itself?  I've seen
examples of both.

Also, I will combine the partial addition of each driver to its respective Kconfig/Makefile
entries.  For this, I believe I need to start with an empty Kconfig/Makefile in the first patch?
