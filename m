The at91sam9g20ek board can work in DT mode, and the sound has support 
in DT mode already.

Sure, the mainly thing we need deal with is the master clock and 
widgets. If put them together will make code ugly or need many many 
#ifdef, I suggest to keep them separately.

For g45ek board, it use AC97 interface, not the case.
