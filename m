If you think I'm arguing because I personally want something, then we're
not going to make any progress.

What I want is for this to be _correct_ and _not_ to introduce silly
restrictions which break people's setups.

Except, as Mark has already pointed out, and as I keep pointing out to
you, and you keep refusing to accept, the kirkwood driver as it stands
is *not* a DPCM driver.  It makes no use of that stuff at all.

What you're doing in kirkwood-i2s is providing two plain DAI links,
and then insisting that only one can be active any any one time.

A DPCM solution provides at least one frontend DAI link and at least
one backend DAI link.  Your code does not do this.

The second point is that - and as I keep telling you - that as soon
as you couple your existing code (which restricts things like the
sample rates) you can no longer output anything else through the
optical out ON THE CUBOX.  For this statement, I'm not talking
_generally_,  I'm talking _specifically_ about _one_ _platform_.

Yes, DPCM currently lacks full support, that's been known about for
some time - I've reported it to Mark, but it seems that this isn't
something that is going to get fixed until others put work into it.

Which bit of "we need to support both I2S and SPDIF" in my previous
emails was not clear.  Which bit of "We should only support SPDIF
on the Cubox" was not clear?

I *fully* acknowledge that we need to support both, but I'm putting
a _strong_ recommendation to you _with_ technical reasons why we
should _only_ support SPDIF on the Cubox.
