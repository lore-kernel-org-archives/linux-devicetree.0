We have a problem then.  Booting with this branch[1] and the 3 DT
patches from this set the system hangs.  But before going any further
I'd bet the FW on my board is too old.  This is what I get on my side:

RM V2M-Juno Boot loader v1.0.0
HBI0262 build 1684

ARM V2M_Juno Firmware v1.3.4
Build Date: Aug 27 2015

Time :  14:44:50
Date :  13:06:2016

Press Enter to stop auto boot...

What version are you using?

In the mean time I'm digging up your SCPI patches...

Thanks,
Mathieu
