It's not really a SOC block from a vendor, it's a pseudo-device in a
way. The current one that doesn't use the coldfire offload is just
compatible "fsi-master-gpio".

I can add a vendor but what should it be ? aspeed because it runs on
the aspeed SoCs only ? ibm because we wrote it and FSI is an IBM
protocol ?

<soc>-<block> doesn't make sense here though.

In the original version you are looking at, they are not passed to the
CF per-se but the driver does use aspeed GPIO specific APIs to
configure them to be owned by the CF, so we need the references.

However, I've just reworked the ucode with a few tricks to avoid losing
singificant performance, so that we can indeed pass them to the CF,
thus avoiding the need for a per-system image, so the above are here to
stay.

On what ? Why would an "sram" pointer have a vendor prefix ? Or a
memory region pointer ?

It's gone in the latest version as there's a single FW file now for all
systems.

It's going away.

Indeed :)
