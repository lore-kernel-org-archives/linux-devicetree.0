OK. I think this can work out pretty easily with a bus notifier as I
mentioned before.

But, one thought on doing this in pinmux_get(). I'd simply implement a
Function that read a DT node's pinmux property/node, converted it to a
pinmux mapping table, and registered it with the pinctrl core. Then,
pinmux_get() could simply call this before doing anything else at all.
I don't think you'd need to modify how pinmux_get() worked at all.
