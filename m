There was this comment above the two if statements leading into the switch
statement:

+	/*
+	 * Check if Integer Clock Mode is possible, but avoid it in slave mode
+	 * since we then do not know if lrclk is derived from pclk and the
+	 * datasheet mentions that the frequencies have to match exactly in
+	 * order for this to work.
+	 */
+	if (params_rate(params) == 8000 || params_rate(params) == 16000) {
+		if (master) {
+			switch (max9860->pclk_rate) {

Maybe it wasn't clear that this comment applied to the whole if-if-switch
block? Will it be good enough to extend that comment like this:

	/*
	 * Check if Integer Clock Mode is possible, but avoid it in slave mode
	 * since we then do not know if lrclk is derived from pclk and the
	 * datasheet mentions that the frequencies have to match exactly in
	 * order for this to work.
	 * If Integer Clock Mode is not possible, fall through to the code
	 * below utilizing PLL mode (using sysclk == 0 as trigger).
	 */

It is the DVDDIO supply that kills register content. I carefully left
that one out, and only added widgets for the AVDD and DVDD supplies.
If/when someone adds DVDDIO it indeed needs to be handled like you
suggest. Is DVDDIO support required to have an acceptable driver?

I just read the comment for clk_get_rate() in include/linux/clk.h

 * clk_get_rate - obtain the current clock rate (in Hz) for a clock source.
 *                This is only valid once the clock source has been enabled.

The driver needs to know the mclk rate, and it only needs the clock to
be running when the codec is in use, so do you suggest instead?

Cheers,
Peter
