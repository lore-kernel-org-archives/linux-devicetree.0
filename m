Then it is perfectly fine to have 2 compatible strings: one for the FS 
block and one for the HS block.

But as you said, there are other differences in the 2 blocks, so just 
changing to the FS compatible string would not work.

You could just have a high-speed-disable property or something, but look 
thru existing bindings and see if one exists already. If not, propose a 
common one.

Most SoCs end up describing the phys at least for USB 2 and 3 as they 
vary a lot eventhough everyone licenses one of the few IP blocks.
