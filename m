I am not familiar with other HiSilicon DTs but rather with several other
vendors' DTs. This seems inconsistent with the rest. The only other one
with SoC names in the board compatible I know of is i.MX6, where there's
variations between single, dual and quad versions.

Correct, the second one must stay, because that allows for matching
against the SoC. of_machine_is_compatible() does not do partial
comparisons afaik, so there's no value in a vendor,soc-board pattern.

Adding vendor prefixes seems a common task these days (e.g., for the
UDOO Neo we had to define a udoo prefix and couldn't just reuse nxp as
its SoC vendor; hwacom, kingnovel, ucrobotics are some other pending
Chinese vendors I'm aware of, so tocoding isn't singled out). Whether
here it should be one or the other I can't tell, but whether or not a
vendor prefix is available has definitely not been the criteria.

In the case of the HiKey the vendor changed from CircuitCo to LeMaker
and we were able to fully reuse the bootloader and DT. On the other
hand, there's no additional compatible to detect which one you are on.

Independently, hisilicon.txt should be overhauled to not give
contradicting instructions for SoC vs. board. The SoC should say "must
contain ..." about the compatible string.

Which reminds me that this patch is lacking an entry for the SoC!

I also wonder why hi3620-hi4511 comes after hi3798cv200.
