If application change non EQ controls, the others will be unaffected. 
But the classD IP can only supports one EQ control at once, these three 
EQ controls point to the same register field, if application set a 
different EQ control, the error occurs, there will be many errors, it's 
not very reasonable to application. The best way I think is if 
application set one EQ control, the other EQ controls will change to 
0dB, it's also consistent with fact.
