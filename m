This is basically the same procedure that was necessary to get the
OV5640 to enter LP-11 on all its lanes. Power-on procedure writes
an initial register set that gets the sensor to a default resolution,
turn on streaming briefly (I wait 1msec which is probably too long,
but it's not clear to me how to determine that wait time), and then
disable streaming. All lanes are then in LP-11 state.
