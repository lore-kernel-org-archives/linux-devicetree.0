In the patch comment I stated it relied on the dummy regulator as the
codec is always on but maybe I should have been more precise: it is not
out of convenience to keep things on, it is by HW design: I mentioned
it in the comment of "ARM: dts: da850: Add basic DTS for the LCDK":
 "the main PMIC, different and hard-wired on the LCDK (the LDOs and
 DCDCs are always on)" after reviewing the schematics.
I could add that in the patch comment.

Thanks for reviewing.
