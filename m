Yes.  But I don't remember reading this passage before.  Just becuase
this is no longer v2, it doesn't void any comments regarding v1
changelogs.

There is no mention of this decision in the changelogs.  If it's not
in the change logs, it didn't happen. ;)

I'm still concerned with the fact that the driver file is named using
and is populated by lots of instances of a "board" name.  I'm sure you
would share my thoughts is someone submitted a driver called
beaglebone.c or raspberrypi.c to MFD.

No, just the name of one.

By pitch, I mean to convince me that this belongs in MFD.

Not to my knowledge, although we do appear to have one.  That doesn't
necessarily mean that it's the right place for it though.  I'm not
entirely sure how CPLDs even work on a functional level.

Understanding was lost when I learned that the whole file was centred
around the premise of board support.  I understand now that this is a
driver for a CPLD, which I'm not sure is even MFD.  Also, if it is
really a CPLD driver, shouldn't be named after the manufacturer/model
number of the chip, rather than the PCB which it's connected to?

I'm also concerned that this driver has no functional CPLD code
contained.  All you're doing is defining an IRQ domain.  Why then
isn't this really an drivers/irqchip (Suggested-by: Josh Cartwright)
driver?
