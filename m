Don't have to be fixed length packets. Every data packets less than 4 words
can be transferred in one time by controller perfectly well as it has 4 data registers.
No shared memory need.

" Passing frame information" is used for long message transfer via shared memory.
But almost all the SCU data frames are less than 4 words. (only quite a few of them,
2~3, over 4 words) For these types of messages, it's obviously more efficient to transfer
them in "Passing short message' way as the MU hardware supports well.

So I believe our SCU firmware has already done the best choice in a most efficient
way (register write is obviously faster than memory copies). Thus, no shared memory
need to be used for SCU protocol case.

The System Controller Firmware (SCFW) is a low-level system function
which runs on a dedicated Cortex-M core to provide power, clock, and
resource management. It exists on some i.MX8 processors. e.g. i.MX8QM
(QM, QP), and i.MX8QX (QXP, DX). 

It's developed by NXP internally.

SCU is doing well. Please see my above reply.

Well, great. That is also our orientation.
Because we thought the way " Passing short message " is the most suitable way for
SCU and is the most efficient way as the most SCU Messages are less than 4 words
and MU hardware supports transfer them well. We could not think out a reason to
not use it. That's why we choose that.

A simple objection that it uses variable length packet seems not quite convincible.
Unless we have more convincible reasons...

How do you think?

For example, what's the real benefits we can get if we drop the HW capability of
"passing Short messages" for SCU in one channel way and use separate 8 Tx/Rx channel
Instead to send them each time? What about the Performance downgrading? 
Is it valuable comparing to the complexity introduced?
