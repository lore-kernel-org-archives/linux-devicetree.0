OK, so where did we deviate from this in your opinion?

Agreed.

Why should there be a central location for device trees?

Please don't lecture me on this.

The bindings are the contract between the OS and the platform, and I
agree that those need to be reviewed and maintained in a central
location, and the kernel tree, while not optimal, is a suitable place
for that.

However, the existence of such contracts means that there is no need
to have a central location for device trees, nor should there be a
need for distros to ever ship device trees with the kernel. That
practice defeats the entire purpose of having contracts in the first
place, especially with the pathetic churn we are seeing in device
trees that are kept in the kernel.
