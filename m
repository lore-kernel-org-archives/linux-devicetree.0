I suspect the compatible should then be "brcm,bcm2835-aux" (or similar) 
since the node would represent the entire aux module, not just the clock 
gate feature of the module (assuming there are other features in the aux 
module besides just the clock gate).

With the reg change and the compatible change if appropriate, you can 
have my ack,
