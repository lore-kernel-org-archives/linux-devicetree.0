It's not drivers that claim to support usb-ehci, but device tree files
that contain nodes that include "usb-ehci" in their compatible value,
yet need to be handled by a driver that isn't the generic USB EHCI
driver, and that driver binds to the other more specific compatible value:

> $ grep -HrnI usb-ehci arch/*/boot/dts

and then search for all those other compatible values in drivers. The
ARM instances certainly all have this issue (although perhaps it's worth
investigating if a generic could work for them instead). The PPC
instances need more investigation; the values don't show up in of match
tables but rather in code.
