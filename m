This whole argument is ridiculous.  Assume for a moment that I agree
and that the firmware (in the embedded context) can be relied upon to
leave the hardware in a sane state.  Even then, an initialization
sequence binding is completely appropriate.  Hardware not required to
boot doesn't need to be initialized, and there are some real reasons
(power consumption for instance) for leaving some pin io left
unconfigured.

Besides, trusting a pin mux init sequence passed in the device tree
inherently means you're trusting firmware has passed accurate data
*and* that the initial state is also sane.
