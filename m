compatible = "libretech,all-h3-cc-h3", "libretech,all-h3-cc",
"allwinner,sun8i-h3";

(See below about the names.) Does that look confusing?

You mean the sun?i-reference-tablet-design.dtsi files? I'm thinking we
might not have to go that far. The other variants could have:

    #include "sun8i-h3-libretech-all-h3-cc.dts"
    #include "sun8i-h5.dtsi"

    And then override the board compatible and model.

Might not work. I'm not sure at this moment.

So I'll leave it as is, as in the DT is correct.

I've asked and this is the preferred name. "Tritium" is more of an internal
codename.

OK.

It's the same as the Orange Pis. The board however does mark it as
"Power Key". However the H3 (on mainline) does not have the ability
to come back up once powered down, nor do we have the ability to
power it off right now. (We could turn it off using "gpio-poweroff",
though I'm sensing the GPIO usage would conflict with the regulator
drivers.) I'll ask about the intended usage and behavior.
