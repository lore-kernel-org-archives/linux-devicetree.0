Right. The "memory" and "IOMMU" targets are really variations of the
same theme here: The one place we need to know about how to access
main memory is when we set up the dma_map_ops, and we already need
to know a number of things there:

- coherency
- bus offsets
- swiotlb range, if needed
- which IOMMU, if any

MSI also seems like something that is worth treating special, in
particular since the ARM implementation so much unlike everybody
else's and we need to have a way to give a consistent API to device
drivers.

If the linkage is the same for multiple devices on the same bus,
I think we can always do it the traditional way using dma-ranges
on the parent bus.

My feeling is that this belongs in the same category as for example
PCI bus windows or pin control: while in theory we could describe
in DT exactly what the hardware is capable of and let the kernel
decide how to do it, this is much too complicated in practice, so
we are better off describing in DT how we /want/ things to be set up,
or how things are already set up by the firmware and not to be
touched.

Ok.
