This patchset adds support for Hi3670 SoC and HiKey970 board. Hi3670 SoC
is very similar to the Hi3660 SoC with additional NPU support. For now,
only UART6 has been enabled which is configured by the bootloader for
console support.

HiKey970 board is one of the 96Boards Consumer Edition and AI platform
based on the Hi3670 SoC.

With this patchset, the Hikey970 board is able to boot into ramdisk with
8 cores.

Thanks,
Mani
