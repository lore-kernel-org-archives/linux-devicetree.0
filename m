It's not really something that's supported; like Charles says the DAPM
mutex is exposed but if the regular controls would still be able to do
stuff.  It is kind of a "you broke it, you fix it" thing but on the
other hand it's better to make things safer if we can since it might not
be obvious later on why things are broken.

Yes, that's definitely doable - we've got some other drivers with
similar things like calibration triggers exposed that way.
