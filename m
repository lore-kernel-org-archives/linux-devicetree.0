Right..

The 'mode' covers only the raw electrical parameters needed to
exchange commands, other timings cover the commands
themselves. Notably the timing mode does not alter those parameters.

To me it seems tidy to keep the 'mode' timings contained in their own
struct and find other homes for the other parameters.

IIRC these timing values are really only necessary if the controller
does not support the READY/BUSY input, in that case drivers typically
seem to use 'chip_delay' which is the maximum possible command
execution time (a sleep long enough to guarentee that READY/BUSY is
de-asserted).

struct onfi_command_timings ?
