Don't see how that's relevant here, but people applying patches should
solicit acks from the appropriate sources, esp. if a patch is across
multiple subsystems.

Why would they want to do that?

In any case, I suspect you're thinking about cross-subsystem Kconfig
entries, which is common, but something like that can be a module
parameter, too.

I would say that maybe CRYPTO_DEV_FSL_CAAM should be made to not depend
on CRYPTO_HW, but I think that's overkill for the addition of this
minor feature.

OK, please mention that next time.

Curious: what subsystem does that?

Thanks,
