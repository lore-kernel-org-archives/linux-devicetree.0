Yes.

? I do not believe that that is necessarily always the case, that would
require an extra fet in the output logic of the pmic which actually
connects it to the ground when powered down. I would expect it to simply
be floating when not enabled.

This all assumes that that regulator is actually tied to the pull-ups,
something which we've no knowledge of whatsoever.

Right which is why I've added the always-on property.

I agree that that would be sensible if this regulator were tied to
the pull-ups, but I've my doubts that it is. We've not seen anything
similar on any other allwinner tablet, other then ChenYu-s Ippo-q8-v5
tablet.

This tablet is sort of a high-end tablet (with a nice ips screen) and
such it also uses a different (better) sensor for its frontcam, a
gc2015 rather then the usual gc0308. I believe that this is the
culprit.

Which would make modelling this as some sort of i2c-bus power-supply
wrong, and I've checked and none of the existing i2c bindings under
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c contain such a thing, so we
would be the first and we will likely have a hard time selling a
binding for this upstream, esp. since we do not know what exactly
is going on.

So all in all I strongly believe that just setting always-on
on the regulator in question is the best solution.

Hans
