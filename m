Sure. Do you have an estimate as to when it will appear?

What are you using for your PSCI implementation? The ARM Trusted
Firmware?

How are you testing it?

For any users who have not updated their FW, this will break booting.

This is why I suggest having hte bootloader/FW fill this in as it should
know what enable-method the FW supports.

If spin-table is just for testing while you await PSCI, drop spin-table
from the dts for now.

Thanks. This _must_ be fixed.

What I'm concerned wit hhere is that the pm_ctrl node and the clock3@0
sub-node have the _exact_ same register space.

Given this should mean that the clock3@0 node owns that register space,
having the container node export this as syscon does not make sense. And
the split between pm_ctrl and clock3@) doesn't seem to make sense given
they cover the same space.

As I asked before, why is pm_ctrl marked as a syscon, and what's the
point of the separate sub-node?

Thanks,
Mark.
