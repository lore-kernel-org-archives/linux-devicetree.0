The RPMh hardware is configured by the boot loader.  The configuration
does reflect reality; however, it cannot handle all configurations at
initialization time.  Specific headroom management typically comes up in
modem usecases for RF supplies that are sensitive to noise.  This feature
allows RPMh masters (application processor, modem processor, etc) to make
requests only for the regulators that they directly care about without
having to worry about power grid parent-child details and setting the
voltage of parent regulators in order to ensure sufficient headroom.

If you really don't like having this feature present in the Linux RPMh
regulator driver, then I'd be ok removing it.  It is not required for
SDM845 which the driver is initially targeting.

Yes.  Physically, there exists no RPMh register to read or write the
voltage of LDOs managed via XOB.  Additionally, the kernel running on the
application processor is blocked from configuring the voltage via a direct
SPMI writes by access permissions that crash the system when violated.

Take care,
