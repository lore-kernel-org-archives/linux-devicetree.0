After taking another look the patchesthere is not much functionality 
that could be moved away from tda998x. It is just that the ASoC side 
(and tda998x) could do more in terms of HDMI standard, but that is fine 
because all that stuff can be added later if/when needed. However, 
instantiating snd_soc_dai_driver etc. in DRM side makes a nasty 
dependency between DRM and ASoC. All that stuff could be in ASoC side 
and simple enum/bitfield parameters defining i2s/spdif selection could 
be passed between DRM and ASoC side.

Me neither. A more straight forward option would be adding an "audio 
header" to the beginning of hdmi encoders drvdata. However, it would be 
tempting to add a pointer for drvdata to snd_soc_dai_driver to add audio 
specific driver data to any device that provides a DAI in addition to 
other functionality. It could even simplify drivers for some audio only 
devices with multiple DAIs.
