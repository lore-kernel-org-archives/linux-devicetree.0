It is actually not that bad (at least on arm64, I checked a while ago),
and you're not using this on any fast path.

Fine by me.

You should use the raw version if you're taking this in an interrupt
context where you really cannot sleep (since RT spinlocks become
sleepable). In your case, you're always in a context where you it
doesn't really matter. So the normal spinlock should the the trick.

Meh. I've grown a lot of white hair since then...
