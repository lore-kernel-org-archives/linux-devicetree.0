No they don't, they are used for clock activation only, and thus should
be disabled on suspend.

I'll have a look, but AFAIR serial core already taking care of that.

Yep.

You forgot the PIT timer, which is the one in cause here (no other
drivers are specifying this IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag), and, as you already
know, a timer sets the IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag.

I don't know what you're trying to prove here, but I never said my goal
was to set IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flags on existing at91 drivers ?
The problem here, is that all those IPs are sharing the irq line with a
timer which sets IRQF_NO_SUSPEND.

I just want to be able to share an irq line with a timer and other
devices that do not set IRQF_NO_SUSPEND.
Could we focus on that ?

Best Regards,

Boris
