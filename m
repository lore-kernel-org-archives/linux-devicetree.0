Marek,

The full text of the first paragraph (in COPYING) is:

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

which is deemed to be entirely sufficient; quoting the full text is
discouraged, especially when it includes the FSF address.  It is also
acceptable to restrict it to version 2 only, in which case something
like this can be used:

   This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
   it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as
   published by the Free Software Foundation.

Of course, it's up to the author to make up their own mind at the end
of the day.

sg_page() + kmap() is preferred, because sg_virt() fails with highmem.
Using sg_virt() means you restrict the driver to non-highmem memory,
and if the kernel wants to place the data into a highmem page, it will
have to use bounce buffers (so it's inefficient).

What's even better is to use the scatterlist iterator, which will handle
this for you.  See the sg_miter_*() functions.
