Agreed, that we can look up all the nodes directly that these phandles
refer to but I would still need a DT entry to bind to. While I could
bind to existing nodes like mscm cpucfg but that doesn't seem right.

The very first approach that we had taken was to integrate this functionality
in mach-vf610.c code under mach-imx
http://www.spinics.net/lists/devicetree/msg80654.html

and then it was recommended to migrate this to drivers/soc where we did use
phandles or direct look up via compatible strings

http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg420847.html

and

http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1506.0/03787.html

There hasn't been a consensus since v1.
