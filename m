I'm not convinced this is a h/w block. This keeps coming up and I
think this is a kernel problem, not a DT problem. Let's face it that
there are drivers at the SOC level which don't fit into a DT node.
They may be the exception, but they are a common exception. My
proposal for how to deal with these cases is here[1].

I also think drivers/soc is a mess because it is randomly used or not.
IMO, using it should not be at the whim of whomever does SOC support.

It is not a syscon. It is just memory. nvmem covers read-only memory,
so I have no issue using that.
