This is a bit worrying. If this causes a high number of boot failures,
fixing the errors you can find is not the path forward as we can't
test a lot of platforms (and many people don't look at -next). We may
want to put this behind a kconfig option so that we can easily restore
old behavior it needed. Otherwise, we could have to revert the series.

Are all the commits before this series fixing boot failures? You can't
do dts updates as the fix or backwards compatibility will be broken.

I still want this to be a struct device and not a struct
platform_device and am not convinced it can't be. It can simply be an
optimization of the existing function:

struct platform_device *of_find_device_by_node(struct device_node *np)
{
  if (node->device && node->device->bus =3D=3D &platform_bus_type)
    return to_platform_device(node->device);
  return NULL;
}
