Yeah, the driver currently sets some default based on what
the chip itself supports and completely ignores the board
inputs.
How about the driver using the defaults and letting the boards
override it (if it ever wants to)?
Currently none of the boards (using any of the twl
regulators) seem to override the defaults and that way a lot of
this duplication in board files could be avoided.
