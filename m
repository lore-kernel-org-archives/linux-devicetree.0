"
NAK. Either this fits in the standard model, or we adapt the standard
model to catter for your particular use case. But we don't define a new,
TI specific API.

No. It will disable "Linux IRQ Y". On IA level there is no mask/unmask/ack functions for ring's events.
sum of rings events keeps "Linux IRQ Y" line physically active until all rings are serviced - empty.
once ring empty - corresponding event auto cleared.

In current implementation the interrupt controller driver will not know what event was generated
when this ti_sci_inta_register_event() is used as this is responsibility of consumer driver
which required to get only one notification - packet received (GIC->Linux IRQ).

We need this to build fast IRQ handling path for networking -
GIC->Linux IRQ considered exclusive and no other event can be assigned to it except
as by using ti_sci_inta_register_event().
I think, it can be considered the same way as "reserved memory" - it exist, but linux
knows nothing about it, while consumer drivers still can have access to it.

ti_sci_inta_register_event() does mostly the same - it steals set of events from IA,
preforms some muxing inside HW and makes one GIC->Linux IRQ visible to Linux IRQ framework
- from Linux point of view allocated GIC->Linux IRQ is just regular irq and It
doesn't know internals (while consumer driver does).

We can't split or divide it on networking/non networking part due to fact that
all resources are dynamic, so ti-sci-inta + FW manages/own resources - and
ti_sci_inta_register_event() is entry point for IRQ resources allocation from
available ranges.

It's no too much different from OMAP CPSW device - just legacy CPSW IRQ generation
schema statically implemented in HW: 8 TX/RX CPPI channels, which are representing
8 linked lists of CPPI descriptor. Any change of linked lists state triggers
local CPSW CPPI IRQ which are summed to generate one (and only one) GIC->Linux IRQ.
It's responsibility of CPSW networking driver to handle CPPI channels in correct order.
And there is no chained IRQ controller implemented simply because of (a) runtime overhead
and (b) impossibility to implement priority handling.

Difference is that CPSW CPPI IRQs need to be asked while K3 AM6 it happens automatically
- and in K3 AM6 HW need to be configured dynamically based on allocated resources.

not exactly - ti-sci-inta expected to work this way only when ti_sci_inta_register_event() is used.
Other allocation will follow standard Linux approach by "maintaining "1:1 mapping".

And that's actually what is implemented IA is real interrupt controller which produces "1:1 mapping",
but it provides possibility to steal and mux IRQ event for non-standard purposes
- networking/ipc. IA is resource owner in this case as there is no way to preallocate/assign
resources statically.
