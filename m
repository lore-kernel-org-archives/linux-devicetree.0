In case of DT, the first clock mentioned in 'clocks' property will get
picked up since it will match with wildcard con_id. This unfortunately
depends on how the clocks list is prepared so quite implementation
dependent.

Its not a problem to have more than one clock passed in device node as
long as only one clock (the first clock) needs to participate in power
management.

This may work for the moment, but longer term I do think genpd
implementation for DaVinci will be needed. Or may be there is breakage
even today that I am not able to think on top of my head.

Thanks,
