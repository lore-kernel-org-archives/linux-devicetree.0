I think for your power switch you should be able to use the
existing gpio regulator binding, so you shouldn't need to
actually write any code.

Take for example wm2200.c, this registers two supplies for the
CODEC through DAPM:

SND_SOC_DAPM_REGULATOR_SUPPLY("CPVDD", 20, 0),
SND_SOC_DAPM_REGULATOR_SUPPLY("AVDD", 20, 0),

These are then hooked up to whatever parts of the CODEC require
power from them. CPVDD powers the charge pumps so is only hooked
up to those, AVDD is the main analogue power for the chip so is
needed whenever the CODEC is up, for such supplies one approach
is to just to hook them up to all the CODEC inputs and outputs,
which is what we do here.

You mention that your power gate might only exist on some
hardware. This hardware differences are what device tree is there
to describe. So lets say your CODEC has a main power supply called
AVDD as in my example above:

codec_pwr: regulator@0 {
	compatble = "regulator-fixed";

	... fixed regulator stuff ...
};

codec_pwr_switch: regulator@0 {
	compatible = "regulator-gpio";

	... regulator gpio stuff ...
};

/* Board with switch */
codec: es8328@11 {
       compatible = "es8328";
       reg = <0x11>;
	AVDD-supply = <&codec_pwr_switch>;
};

/* Board without switch */
codec: es8328@11 {
       compatible = "es8328";
       reg = <0x11>;
	AVDD-supply = <&codec_pwr>;
};

Thanks,
Charles
