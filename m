I know how to write a binding doc with indentations to make it clear.

What I'm talking about is that the doc was created without indentations,
so I don't feel comfortable to add indentations starting from this patch
while leaving the old lines in totally a different style because It's not
helpful to make people read comfortably at all but only forcing people to
think why these two lines are so special to take some steps back here.

So personally I agree with your idea to make doc more readable. But what
I prefer to do is not having a conversation on the style within this patch
but to create an extra style-refinement patch later after this one.

Let's just focus on the function itself right now. We can later send a
patch to refine this entire doc. Won't you think it's a better idea? :)

Thank you
Nicolin
