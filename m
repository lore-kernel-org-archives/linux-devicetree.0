I've been carrying for awhile some patches that Yu Chen was
previously pushing upstream to enable USB on the HiKey960 board
and I wanted to try to nudge them forward as I'm not sure as to
what his plans are.

This series is just the simpler parts of the patch set that I
wanted to send out to see if we could make some progress on
while I continue to work on the more complex bits.

You can find the full set of changes to get USB working on the
board here:

This series is just the more trivial changes, along with some
missing binding documentation that I've added.

I'd greatly appreciate any review or feedback on this series!

thanks

New in v2:
* Tweaked binding clock name as clk_usb3phy_ref didn't seem right.
