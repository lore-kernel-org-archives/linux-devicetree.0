The macro seems tidier. Just a nit.

By the time you exit the spinlock the write may still haven't been
effected. Maybe use writel() there.

And there should be >600 instances of *static* globals that are
protected by some static spinlock  ;)

Here the static sti_mbox_chan_lock protects sti_mbox_device which is
allocated during probe. I hope you agree that the standard practice is
to make the lock a member of the same structure that it protects.
Otherwise it gives the wrong impression that the same lock will be
used for any number of allocated mailbox instances.

cheers.
