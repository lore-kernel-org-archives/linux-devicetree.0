Returning -EBUSY only when streaming is too late, as ioctl's
may be changing the pipeline configuration and/or buffer allocation,
while the application is sending other ioctls in order to prepare
for streaming.

V4L2 has a mechanism of blocking other apps to change such
parameters via VIDIOC_S_PRIORITY[1]. If an application sets
priority to V4L2_PRIORITY_RECORD, any other application attempting
to change the device via some other file descriptor will fail.
So, it is a sort of "exclusive write access".

On a quick look at V4L2 core, currently, sending a 
VIDIOC_S_PRIORITY ioctl to a /dev/video device doesn't seem to have
any effect at either MC or V4L2 subdev API for the subdevs connected
to it. We'll likely need to add some code at v4l2_prio_change()
for it to notify the subdevs for them to return -EBUSY if one
would try to change something there, while the device is priorized.

Hmm... I guess some gst developer mentioned that there are/where
some restrictions at libv4l2 with regards to DMABUF. I may be
wrong.

Sure. That's why we're discussing here :-)

I hear you. A solution via libv4l could be more elegant, but it
doesn't seem simple, as nobody did it before, and depends on the
libv4l plugin mechanism, with is currently unused.

Also, I think it is easier to provide a solution using DT and some
driver and/or core support for it, specially since, AFAICT,
currently there's no way request exclusive access to MC and subdevs.

It is probably not possible do to that exclusively in userspace.

Yeah, when there's no scaler, it should report just the resolution(s)
supported by the sensor (actually, at the CSI) via
V4L2_FRMSIZE_TYPE_DISCRETE.

However, when there's a scaler at the pipeline, it should report the
range supported by the scaler, e. g.:

- V4L2_FRMSIZE_TYPE_CONTINUOUS - when an entire range of resolutions
  is supported with step = 1 for both H and V .

- V4L2_FRMSIZE_TYPE_STEPWISE - when there's either a H or V step at
  the possible values for resolutions. This is actually more common
  in practice, as several encodings take a 2x2 pixel block. So, the
  step should be at least 2.

There is something to be considered by the logic that forwards the
resolution to the CSI: a lower resolution there means a higher number of
frames per second.

So, if the driver is setting the resolution via a V4L2 device, it
will provide a higher number of fps if it selects the lowest 
resolution at CSI that it is greater or equal to the resolution
set at the scaler. On the other hand, the image quality could be 
better if it doesn't scale at CSI.

Mauro
