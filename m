file_operations.write() should parse signal and message, coming from
userspace, into a local structure before routing them via
mbox_send_message and tx_prepare respectively.

No. Command/Signal code is passed via mbox_send_message(signal). The
payload is passed via Shared-Memory during tx_prepare(message)

I have seen more channels to be rx+tx, than rx/tx only. And for latter
case the user should run 2 test threads, one each for RX and TX.

That's actually my point :)
When the userspace already has all that platform specific knowledge,
why check for 'valid' usage in controller driver? Simply reject any
request that the controller isn't capable of (which is practically
never supposed to happen).
