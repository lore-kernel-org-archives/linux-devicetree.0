I initially wrote the bindings from a developer's point of view, or
someone implementing CoreSight on their system.  As such there would
be no doubts about the acronyms found in the bindings as the same
nomenclature is used throughout the documentation.

But from an onlooker's perspective I can see how they can be
confusing.  As Sudeep suggested I will add a short description for
each binding.

I thought long and hard about this when initially working on the
bindings. All CoreSight blocks are independent from one another and
they don't need a bus to be accessed or configured.
