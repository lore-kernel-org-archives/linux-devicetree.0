You mean config symbols? There are 2-3 config symbols we don't want with
ARCH_MULTI_V7M and we have to exclude. But there would be also a
duplication of some already given by multiplatform when creating a new
top level config symbol...

Just from a selection view, ARM946 and ARM940 would still _not_ be
selectable because this change makes ARCH_MULTI_V4T/V5 being dependent
on MMU.

Would be a partial revert (remove ARCH_MULTI_* from CPU_ARM940T and
CPU_ARM946E) of dc680b989d51 ("ARM: fix multiplatform allmodcompile") be
the right thing to do then? Given that ARCH_MULTI_V4T/V5 is MMU
dependent, those CPU's will not be selected even when building the
integrator multiplatform image... However, due to the selection
limitations outlined above, this would only be cosmetic anyway.

When keeping the old CPU's out of multiplatform game properly, what
would speak against ARCH_MULTI_V7M? I still think if we allow a
multiplatform v7M image, it is cleaner to align that to the MMU
multiplatform stuff.

Maybe I don't really get the grasp of ARM_SINGLE_ARMV7M. In my
understanding it would be a new top level config symbol which kind of
merges ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM and ARCH_MULTI_V7M.

It is not my goal to enable !MMU on MULTIARCH per se. It's just that
when enabling V7M with ARCH_MULTIPLATFORM, it makes it easier to enable
the Cortex-M4 for the HMP platforms on those multiplatform only SoC's.
When creating a new config symbol on a high level, this advantage is
gone... I then could also create a top level ARCH_MXCV7M, which selects
multiplatform only ARCH_MXC.
