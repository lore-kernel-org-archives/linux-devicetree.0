We are in agreement with respect to this point.

I also agree with this point.

Nope.

However, such a change is essentially untestable by me.  So, I didn't 
attempt it.   pci_fixup_irqs() is used by alpha, arm, m68k, mips, sh, 
sparc, tile, unicore32 and other things as well.  If the core 
pci_device_add() code were to suddenly start doing the fixup, there 
would be the potential to break all these things I cannot test.

The new pci_bus_fixup_irqs() is really an optimization so that if we 
have multiple buses created by pci-host-generic.c, that we only iterate 
over each device once.  I believe that pci-host-generic.c would still 
operate without these patches 1/5 and 2/5, and could test that if you 
are OK with the remaining three patches.  Or we could merge all 5 and 
live a while longer with the ugliness that is already there.
