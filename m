Okay now I have finished my criticism, I will make some productive
suggestions :)

How about we implement a system as follows; modify the clock framework
and bindings such that we not only describe all the parents possible
for a clock, we also enter into the device tree the current parent? I
actually didn't fully realise it until now, but that just isn't in
there (it's derived from the list in the parents property and the
current hardware setting!).

That way, at least on clock initialization it will be able to warn
that the parent in the device tree is not the one in hardware, and -
with suitable options or by default - warn that it is setting the
parent to the one in the device tree. That solves the "which parent I
want" problem without involving ACTUAL configuration, and meets
Sascha's requirement that it is not done by a back door of
configuration items. So to summarize, the process is

* Device tree describes all parents of a clock in parents property
* Device tree describes which parent is the "current" parent
* Linux parses the tree and registers the clock - checks if the parent
in HW is the same as the one in DT
 - if it is not the same, print a horrific warning to the kernel log
 - if we desire to (and it should be possible to make this a debug
option for clock subsystem) set the parent to the one in the DT (also
printing a horrific warning that it has done so)

To solve the issue of "setting clocks to fixed rates", I would suggest
we do it by way of a similar system to the cpu frequency drivers or
regulators, and use operating points or ranges. For a good chunk of
devices, actual clock gating, rate changing and power management are
possible and highly useful in myriad different ways depending on the
device. In this way, an audio codec may end up with a list of
"operating-points" in a node which describes all the valid clock
rates. For example the SGTL5000 can accept many input clocks, the
CS42L52 audio codec can also accept many input clock rates - and the
audio frequency support is determined by those clock rates. For the
latter example, this huge table;

http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/sound/soc/codecs/cs42l52.c#n690

.. is a move-to-device-tree candidate. The driver could pick a
suitable operating point from a range (which it could determine by the
rates the clock phandle supports), and you can even "suggest" one the
same way we do for regulators - only supply a single value. That way,
everything looks like it is being done on the basis of power
management, WOULD be used as power management on a vast chunk of
devices, and can be "restricted" to only work for specific values on
systems which didn't have the dynamism of others (for instance the
MC13892 PMIC has many regulators with wide ranges of voltages, but on
most systems they are tied to specific, fixed voltage rails so giving
a range makes no sense, and there's no real driver that can take
responsibility for setting them. But some use cases may tie the same
regulator output to a dynamic voltage rail, so you can't get away with
just being fixed or just being totally rangey)

How does that sound (audio codec pun not entirely intentional..)?
