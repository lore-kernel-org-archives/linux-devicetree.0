I had a bug in the calling driver, passing the wrong irq down to this
function. But now that I think more about it I should probably check
for "d" being non-NULL. On the other hand, that will still just catch
a minor set of bugs as both of those will in most cases produce
"valid" pointers.

Maybe it's okay to just trust the caller to pass a valid irq? Or do
you have any other suggestion of sanity checking the input value?
Preferably without also passing the pm_irq_chip pointer.

I continued my search and this needs to be accessed by gpio, mpp, adc,
charger, bms and usb(?). So we have to expose it in some form.

implementation we couldn't have used it anyways.

Our use case is different in that we're at any point in time
interested in reading out the status of the irq line, as the only way
of getting that status.

It might be a long shot, but let's spin a patch for our purpose and
run it by Tomas again.
