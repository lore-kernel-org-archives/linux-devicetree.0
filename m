Grrr, I'm not talking about me - I'm talking about people testing
linux-next. And perhaps in this particular case it won't matter because
this hw is not shipping yet or whatever but the question is about the
principle of the whole thing.

I'm talking about *other* patches for another driver.

Please note that I'm replying to this thread as an example - the
procedural question I have is not only related to the synopsys changes
but the synopsys changes are a good example for the problem of EDAC
changes being sent to me along with DT additions.

As such, the question was aimed more at arm-soc people - that's why they
were in To: - not at you.
