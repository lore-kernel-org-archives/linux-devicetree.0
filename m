We tend to do it in cases where the software has no other way to find out
what interfaces are supported. I guess if it becomes necessary, we can
use a different "compatible" value for an extended future version of this,
but that scales only to so many different variants.

Hmm, let's try to solve this another time, I don't think there is an easy
answer. Maybe we really need a common entry point for the cache
controller setup, or move it completely out of platform specific code
for the case where it can be probed from DT.

Thanks for doing the research!
