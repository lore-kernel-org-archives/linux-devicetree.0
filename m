Is this really the only problem with maintaining lots of boards? What
about all the other nodes that are conditionally enabled? Really, I
don't see the problem with 3 lines per node.

Does having an unused port enabled cause problems? If not, you could
handle it all at run-time and just shutdown ports which have no link.
You'd want to do that anyway for boards with a port, but is not
connected to a drive (except for hotplug capable ports).

Maybe we could add a property in /chosen that is a list of nodes to
enable and either the bootloader or kernel could update their
'status'. Or It could even be done in dtc perhaps with some
/directive/.
