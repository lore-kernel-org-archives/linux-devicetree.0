Getting people to join straight from "the community" isn't likely. Or
if people join, it might not be the people you actually need. It's
more likely that people involved both with upstream and other things
at various vendors will join and try to keep things sane.

However, given that UEFI/ACPI is a standards body, the number of actual
software engineers interested in participating in such activity might
be small.

Imposing a maintenance burden on a larger set of users is the completely
wrong way to do this.

I'm hoping what you're meaning to say is that we can share infrastructure
and solutions between the various architectures, which is a completely
different thing than imposing our maintenance on them. :)

Still, I'm with Arnd here: It's not a given at this time that we'll ever
enable ACPI across the board. For the short-to-medium term it certainly
seems like a bad idea to bring in much code for it, and for the longer
term we don't know yet. For a vendor, it's safer to plan for both --
and if you don't care about RT compatibility focus on DT today (but keep
an eye on ACPI developments).
