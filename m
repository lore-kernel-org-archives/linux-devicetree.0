Yes, I agree. That would be better.

no, these get written to different registers, one for pinmux, one for
pull up/down and one for drive strength. It would be helpful of your
pinmux-simple.c can support writes to multiple registers also.

Yes, it is the driver that finds out the gpio number from dt and
requests it. Maybe, I did not understand your point here.

With the approach that I mentioned in the previous email, there are no
pinmux, pin groups or pin desc tables built from dt. Each device node
specifies what needs to configured (pinmux,pinconfig) and the code
using that device node uses pinctrl driver to get those
pinmux/pinconfig values written to the hardware registers.

Does the dt support for pinmux/pinconfig that you are developing build
the pinmux, pin groups or pin desc tables? Do drivers have to call
pinmux_{get/put}() or pin_config_set() functions even in dt case?

Thanks,
Thomas.
