This[1] is what I had commented on the partitions before. I did not 
mean to remove partitions altogether, just comments referring to 
compatibility with pre-flashed software shipping with LCDK (since that 
changes without notice).

Apologies for any confusion caused. The "Rest of the patch looks good
to me" in the end was to say that the partitions themselves look fine :)

Can you please submit a v2 with partitions added?

Thanks,
Sekhar

FWIW, silicon version 2.1 supports booting from block 0, but needs new
boot pin settings not possible in stock LCDK.

I would rather not refer to the software that LCDK ships with in the
comments at all. Because that can change without notice. At some point,
if mainline kernel works well enough on LCDK, TI might decide to ship
LCDKs with mainline kernel flashed.

Rest of the patch looks good to me.
