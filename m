That works, thanks.

The isochronous interrupt rate is just a way to poll the hardware FIFO
for timestamps and transfer them into a s/w FIFO where they're available
to be read from user space.

The rate depends on how frequently clients will be generating timestamps
at and the driver doesn't know that. That's why we set it from user
space. If the interrupt rate is too fast it could bog down the system,
and it can be very fast. The highest rate is almost always going to be
too fast. If it's set too slow then there will be FIFO overflows. Since
only user space knows the frequency of the input channel, it's up to the
user to set an appropriate rate. A good rate may be twice the frequency
of the highest frequency client. Since what clients are being used at
runtime is unknown to us and will vary from system to system we really
don't know what to set this rate to. One user may only be interested in
audio, another may only be interested in something connected to a GPIO.
One user may be running audio at a fast sample rate, another very slow,
etc.

The only way I can see it working is if we enabled a client (external
time stamping channel in PTP) with an expected frequency, then set the
IRQ interval to some pre-determined rate (ie- 2x) and then adjust the
rate as new clients are enabled and divider values are set.

It to nanosecond precision so it can be ridiculously quick.

Hope the description above helped. Timestamping can be controlled from
user space. Since we don't know which clients are being or the frequency
of the input, we don't know what to set the divider to. The user knows
what they have hooked up to a channel, the rate of it, and the rate they
want timestamps generated at (divided down to).

Maybe an example will help. We have user space process A interested in
channel 1, and B in channel 2. A timestamp for channel 2 is in the FIFO
(the FIFO holds timestamps for all channels). What happens if client A
does a read for a timestamp and it's for channel 2? The timestamp has
been pulled out of the s/w FIFO in the driver. What do we do with it now?

Having separate FIFO's allows process A to only retrieve channel 1
timestamps.

Our original non PTP driver ioctl (DTE_GET_TIMESTAMP) solved that
problem because we could specify a channel. We're now trying to adapt it
to PTP so we don't have to write a new "DTE" user and kernel side API.

I'll look more into so_timestamping to see how that's used but we wanted
one generic interface to get timestamps from channels because anything
can be hooked up to a channel.
