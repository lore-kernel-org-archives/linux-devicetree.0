Right, then state that clearly in the binding.

The device tree /normally/ describes things that are either wired up
in hardware or set up by the boot loader. Describing things that the
boot loader may or may not have set up and that the kernel should
set up but may ignore if it wants to is a bit fishy, but it seems
that you have decided to do it that way. You should definitely
document the fact that all ranges except the "internal-regs" are just
suggestions and cannot be relied on to be present at boot time.

A cleaner approach would be to require that all ranges here are exactly
the ones that have been configured by the boot loader, and state the
OS can either assume that they are valid or can reprogram them as
needed. That would imply that you don't actually need an mbus driver
unless you want to dynamically reassign the windows.

Please also add a property that describes the address range in which
the windows might be reassigned, i.e. everything that is not RAM.

Ok.
