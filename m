Hello Andrew,

Thanks for the comment. But I am not sure how to break this up as this is 
an enhancement to the driver to support a newer version of the cspw 
hardware. Without all these pieces together, the driver can't
function. Probably I can make the below break up based on different functions
added. Let me know if this looks good to you. Beware that patch #2 and
#3 are small patches and majority of code change will be in patch #1
which has to go together. 

Patch #1. Add support new link interface, RGMII_LINK_MAC_PHY, for K2G
          - Most of the code is for this
Patch #2. Add support for configuring phy_mode 
          - This just add phy_mode handling code 
Patch #3. map all vlan priorities to flow id 0
