Ok I will remove them in v2.

Ok will change to demux@08a20000 in v2

It is the name of the IP block in the datasheet. It stands
for SECurity TRansport Processor FrontEnd

That doesn't really make sense, the demod is a seperate device
typically controlled over I2C bus and connected to this IP block
via the TS pins. Also although a tsin channel is "normally" connected
to a demodulator device there is no reason it couldn't be connected
for example to another STi chipset which is doing tsout.

Also this IP block can do more than accept tsin, it can
also do tsout, and merge TS channels together (some coming from
DDR, external TS pins). Which are features we hope to add
to the driver in the future so the name needs to be very generic.

So with that in mind I would prefer to leave the compatible as
the name of the IP block from the SoC datasheet.

Will fix in V2

This driver is actually already accepted, I just missed off one patch from
the v2 series which meant this patch broke the build when Mauro applied it,
which is the reason for re-sending it.

This binding is the same way the drm display drivers use DT via ddc-i2c-bus
property to get the i2c bus for EDID control, so I think uncontroversial.

Doing a grep, that does seem to be "more standard". Will fix in V2 as a single
atomic commit.

Peter.
