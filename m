For the I2S In, there is another issue with flushing on stream close. If
the stream is stopped, then reconfigured to use a larger number of
channels (without the stream being closed), then the per-channel fifos
will become inconsistent with each other. The new channels will have no
samples in their FIFOs, while the others may contain samples from the
previous stream.

Would hw_params be the correct place to flush instead?
