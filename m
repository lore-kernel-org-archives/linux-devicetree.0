I'm pretty sure I explained the idea above originally and was ignored.
Jason Gunthorpe might remember better, but I think he liked it when I
originally proposed doing it this way.

The main differences are:

* It unifies the binding for the PCIe case and all other registers. There is no
  need to treat PCIe special in the binding this way, which is more future-proof
  and more consistent.

* Since the host physical address for the PCIe memory space window is set up
  dynamically anyway, there is no reason to hardcode it in DT. We want it to
  be as large as possible, and this way the mbus driver can just pick the largest
  free area itself after setting up all the other mappings from the ranges
  property.

* The binding actually allows the PCIe translation to be discontiguous, so if
  we want to improve the code in the future, we can fill all the holes in the
  mbus space with PCIe windows without changing the binding.

* It separates hardware description (in the PCIe node) from policy (in the mbus
  node), just like we do for all the other mbus children.
