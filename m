The whole reasoning for not unflattening the DTB in the presence of ACPI
is that it's unlikely we can stop drivers using DTB information in
addition to ACPI, leaving us with a completely non-standard mess. We
really don't want people mixing the two, and it's going to be a struggle
if the information is readily available (even preventing probing based
on compatible string isn't enough because of some drivers which probe
from an initcall or look up magic paths).

So if we were to unflatten the tree in the ACPI case, at a minimum it
needs to be unflattened to a separate root that only exists for sysfs,
and is not at exposed to the mercy of the rest of the kernel.

This is the first I'd heard of the reserve map being deprecated, and
we're going to have DTs with reserved map entries for a long time going
forwards.

There are also other kernels (e.g. Xen) using DT that I believe handle
reserve map entries but not (currently) reserved-memory nodes, and I'd
rather we didn't have the kernel rewrite things they understand into
things they didn't. For debugging on a production kernel I'd also like
to have as close to the original information provided as possible
exposed to userspace.

Can't we expose the header fields under something like
/sys/firmware/devicetree/dtb-header/, parallel to the usual
/sys/firmware/devicetree/base for nodes?
