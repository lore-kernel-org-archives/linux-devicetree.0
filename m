Hmm, definitely we somehow miss the point here. So what happens
if we only do Voice Activity Detection (VAD) ?

This means that there is no sample rate yet configured, so for this reason
we get the sampling rate as above via ALSA kcontrol interface.

My feeling is that somehow we will need to create maybe another type
of stream (VAD?).

This is a thing that we need to think. Suggestions are welcomed!

Of course, so would this be a better option to select it from dts?

We can go back to mutexes no problem, but we thought that atomic vars
are lighter.

We first used mutexes but I suggested switching to atomic vars because
AFAIK they are lighter than mutexes.
