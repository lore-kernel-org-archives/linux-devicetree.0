This patchset include dts changes for hi6220 SoC and HiKey board. These
patches apply well one by one on top of next-20160401.

To avoid merge conflicts with patches already ack'ed by maintainers,
I picked all hi6220/hikey dts related patches into this single patchset.
And they passed the tests on HiKey.

Patch 1~3 are from hi6220 cpuidle support. It has been reviewed and
ack'ed in maillist.
[PATCH v2 RESEND 0/4] arm64: Hi6220: enable CPU idle states:
http://archive.arm.linux.org.uk/lurker/message/20160121.105346.7d3b0470.en.html

Patch 4~6 are for hi6220 gpio, pinctl and spi configurations respectively.

Patch 7 adds hi6220 i2c nodes, and
patch 8 enables them for hikey board usage.

Patch 9 adds add hi6220 usb node. It has been sent to maillist.
[PATCH] arm64: dts: add hi6220 usb node
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.devicetree/146062
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.devicetree/144335/focus=134022

Patch 10 and 11 are from hi6220 mailbox support. It has been reviewed and
ack'ed in maillist.
[PATCH v7 RESEND 0/4] mailbox: hisilicon: add Hi6220 mailbox driver
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2152759/focus=2152768

Patch 12 adds pinctrl to uart ports in SoC and enables them for HiKey board.
Patch 13 adds gpio LEDs device nodes.

Patch 14 adds hi655x pmic dts node and regulator support.
[PATCH v8 5/5] arm64: dts: hisilicon: Add hi655x pmic dts node
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2151688

Patch 15 adds dwmmc nodes description for hi6220. It refers to two LDO's
which are defined above.
Patch 16 adds wifi device node (TI's wl1835) for HiKey board.


v2:
- picked hi655x pmic dts node.
- removed dw_mmc resets property, as it is still under review.
- add 'non-removable' into dw_mmc2 for wifi
