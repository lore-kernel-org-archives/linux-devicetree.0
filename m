FWIW ALSA does not support decoders. The compressed ALSA API allows you to
encode or decode your conent on a DSP, it provides API for that

If you have an additional need for a decoder or an encoder which is not
listed, feel free to send a patch!
The most important point is frameowrk is there for thsi so you need to use
that and add whatever is not supported

I disagree. You can use alsa PCM device to send pcm data and then use alsa
compressed device to take back the compressed content. The two devices need
to be "connected" using DPCM and DAPM frameowork availble. It should work
with little or no changes

And why can't you use ALSA kcontrols for volume??

Again why can't you use ALSA kcontrol for effects, be it PCM or compressed
progarmming an EQ thru alsa kcontrol remains same

Wrong on this count

Yes and it should work

NAK for that, this should be an ALSA driver
