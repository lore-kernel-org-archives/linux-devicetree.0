There aren't any plans that I'm aware of. I'm just assuming there are
some cases in the tree. It would just be some additional build rules:

board-kit.dtb: soc-som.dtb expansion-board.dtbo
  fdtoverlay -o $@ -i $^

We'd need to come up with some way to express the input and output
files in a kbuild way. Perhaps similar to how multiple module files
are done.

Even if you are adding new platforms, having the above would still be
good. It captures what base the overlays apply to and tests that
applying actually works (rather than leaving that for the user to do
in the bootloader). FIT images also have or need that information, so
perhaps we can define a format that works as input for both kbuild and
FIT images.

Runtime, but still at boot time, right?

How is the kernel going to have better error handling? Is libfdt error
handling worse than the kernel's overlay code?

I do think we need to standardize how we tell bootloaders what
overlays to apply. I expect that we'll do that as part of EBBR spec[1]
though that is not part of the immediate focus.
