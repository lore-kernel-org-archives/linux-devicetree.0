Yes, but who is "eeprom-consumer"? DT nodes generally describe a h/w
block, but it this case, the consumer depends on the OS, not the h/w.
I'm not saying you can't describe where things are, but I don't think
you should imply who is the consumer and doing so is unnecessarily
complicated.

Also, the layout of EEPROM is likely very much platform specific. Some
could have a more complex structure perhaps with key ids and linked
list structure.

I would do something more simple that is just a list of keys and their
location like this:

device-serial-number = <start size>;
key1 = <start size>;
key2 = <start size>;
