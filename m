The problem is that if someone tries to dereference the gc field, and
it's no longer valid, which could cause an OOPS. Perhaps we can get away
just with a comment in the struct definition indicating that this field
should only be used by drivers that provided the gc field directly
rather than having it set up by DT, but then why even store it when
creating the ranges from DT in that case?
