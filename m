They don't normally change stuff intentionally, but you can have
drivers for the same hardware that are written so differently that
it becomes hard to spot that they are doing the same thing.

We have a bunch of XGMAC drivers for the same basic licensed IP block,
each one configured a bit differently and extended with some soc-specific
bits, and drivers written from scratch.

I would also not assume that people are trying hard to hide something
from you, it's more that some guy is given the task to write a driver
for an IP block, but is not told who made that, so the binding will
just come with the name of the company he's working for.

Right, but they would then also have to load the code for the other
blocks they did not license.

Yes, and I would expect you to reject any such driver submission.

Not following you here, what is the problem here?

Agreed. If the drivers need to talk to one another, that is a clear
sign that the devices are not actually independent and that they
really belong into a single driver. That's not the case I'm thinking
of here.

The devicetree just describes the available hardware blocks. Typically
you have one node for one block (e.g. a memory controller), and then
have one driver for that block. Things get a little funny if you want
to have multiple drivers for the same device, e.g. you want a driver
in drivers/memory/ to support autorefresh in sleep states and another
driver in drivers/edac to support error handling. If you get something
like this, you need some coordination between the two drivers, but that
is unrelated to devicetree or not.

A platform driver should match against a set of similar devices that are
identified by a "compatible" string, and we try to list the name of the
ip block here, which could be something like "arm,pl12345rev1.2" if it
is licensed from another company, or if that is not known, describe it
by using the product number of the first chip it appeared in, e.g.
"amcc,405ez-memory-controller". APM does not use numbers for their
chips, so "apm,xgene-memory-controller" would refer to the memory
controller used in the "xgene" chip. If they come out with a second
product that uses the same one, they would use the same string, or
use "apm,ygene-memory-controller" for the one that is in "ygene" if
that is slightly different. The driver can then match against both
and handle the differences based on the compatible string.

The point where it gets silly is when you try to handle multiple
unrelated devices in the same driver and you get a probe function
that just does:

apm_edac_probe(struct platform_device *dev)
{
	if (dev_is_xgene_mc(dev))
		return apm_probe_xgene_mc(dev);
	if (dev_is_xgene_l2(dev))
		return apm_probe_xgene_l2(dev);
	if (dev_is_ygene_mc(dev))
		...
}

with each of the called functions implemented in a separate file.
