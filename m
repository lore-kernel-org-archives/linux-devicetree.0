This series attempts to standardize device naming and improve
its information for better identification

The values of the "compatible" and "model" device-tree properties
are corrected for some devices, adding complementary information
when necessary

Additionally, a device-tree file is renamed to reflect the real model
of the device

I'm sending the series as an RFC because I don't know if
device-tree files can be renamed and properties be changed
(the last patch in particular)

The patches are sorted (descending) by what I think is
the probability of being accepted

Luis Araneda (5):
  arm: dts: zynq: Set correct manufacturer for ZedBoard and MicroZed
    boards
  dt-bindings: xilinx: Add missing zynq boards
  arm: dts: zynq: correct and improve the model property of dt files
  arm: dts: zynq: rename board zed to zedboard
  arm: dts: zynq: remove "zynq" prefix from compatible property
