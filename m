I think you need to explain why it's safe to change the layout of the
flash partitions like this.

- What is this "misc" partition?

- Why is it safe to move the "misc" partition in this way?

- Do users need to do anything with data stored in the "misc" partition
  when changing kernels?

If the "misc" partition is simply unused space on the flash device, why
list it in DT?
