Well, presumably the pinctrl driver itself could have both default/idle
states, and system sleep could engage the appropriate system-wide setting.

Isn't the driver (or DT binding) supposed to define what pinctrl states
must exist, and those state must always exist? There's no requirement
for a pinctrl state definition to always actually contain content that
changes the state. That's exactly why PIN_MAP_TYPE_DUMMY_STATE exists.

That certainly does imply that individual drivers do need to handle this
explicitly. Although I still think that only specific drivers actually
affected by this should end up actively managing pinctrl; shouldn't
anything that can get away with relying on system hogs do so?
