audio_pll is referenced exclusively by the card device

i2s_mclk and dac_mclk can also be referenced by other devices. The i2s
out controller references i2s_mclk, and codec devices can reference
i2s_mclk/dac_mclk dependent on their system clock requirements

without a reference to i2s_mclk and dac_mclk in the card driver, it
would not be possible to control the divisors and gates for these clocks
in the following cases:

Simplistic codecs that do not have drivers

Codec drivers that do not call clk_set_rate and clk_enable/clk_disable
