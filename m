Good.

Uh, nice. I will check out the vt.

Hm, okay. That might lead to confusion then...

and we should make the socfpga_cyclone5 a dtsi. I can do that.
It's early in development and I see no reason not to fix it now.
We have seen quite a lot of rearrangment with the imx6 for example. No need to
duplicate it, if we know it beforehand.

Yeah, broken might have been a bit harsh :-D
But my first experience with the mainline kernel was a scrambled serial console
and hanging system as soon as you use the ethernet/ip=dhcp.
And the SD wasn't working for me, too. But those SD cards are really more problematic
than one might think, so...

But as I said: with your patch series, both is working. Looking forward to your
next versions of those patches.
Now I have a hanging system, when I add the at24 on i2c-0, what ever might be
the reason for that :-D

BTW: you don't happen to have any insight in what crazy things you do with the CRC32
in your prebootloader, do you? Been trying some time to calculate the crc, but never
got to the one the mkpimage generates. It doesn't seem to be what crc32 or chksum
calculate or the datasheet is missing some essential info for me to understand it.

Steffen
