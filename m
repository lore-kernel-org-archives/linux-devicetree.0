Alas, that worked for machines with 512 MiB of main memory, but failed
on 1 GiB machines.  My guess is that, when the initrd and dtb are near
the top of a 1 GiB memory, the virtual address gets too near the top of
the kernel's 1 GiB of virtual space (which starts at 0xc0000000),
perhaps colliding with the VMALLOC space.

Putting them just below the 128 MiB boundary seems to work.
