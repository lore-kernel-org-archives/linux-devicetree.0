I still think that "ehci-generic" would be better than "ehci-platform"  
(and the same for ohci).  The reason is that "-platform" is essentially
meaningless, whereas "-generic" strongly suggests that the hardware
matches the specification with no special features or requirements.  
Since the compatibility string -- like everything else in DT -- is
supposed to be a description of the hardware, this seems only logical.

It might even be a good idea to change the "xhci-platform" string to 
match, it that doesn't cause too much trouble.
