No. And putting a driver in mach-<whatever> does not give the permission to do
whatever you want. I won't tell you how OSS works, but moving code around or
using another tree to circumvent a code review is just the best way to upset
maintainers in general and hurt your karma.

That said, I think you misunderstood my comment (or I was not clear). In the
discussion given in the link above, I am in favor, somehow, to distinguish
clockevent and clocksource to solve exactly what you are facing.

Rob Herring told me it could be acceptable to have a property to tell if it is
a clockevent or a clocksource.

Mark Rutland disagreed on this.

I was alone in the discussion, no consensus have been found.

Now, you have a particular use case and I would like to resurrect the
discussion in order to find a solution which can apply to all DT drivers.
