Yes... I can do this but I don't see how it will scale when some SoC
in the future may have more or less instance of the memory controllers
for example. I guess for now, I will just iteration 4 time with an
single base address or four resources in a loop. Let's agreed on the
DT layout and I will generate an new patch then. See below...

The top level interrupt may be different and APM specific unless other
vendors adapt the same bit definitions. I highly doubt other vendor
will use the same bit definitions. The CSW is APM only. The MCB A, MCB
B, and memory controller are APM only. The L3, and SoC are APM specify
only. For L1 and L2, I will need to check with the CPU designer - but
likely APM specific.

See above.

Now let us discuss the DT layout if it is an single driver:

xgeneedac: xgeneedac@7e800000 {
        compatible = "apm,xgene-edac";
        regmap-efuse = <&efuse>; /* efuse */
        reg = <0x0 0x78800000 0x0 0x100>, /* Top level interrupt
status resource */
                <0x0 0x7e200000 0x0 0x1000>, /* CSW for MCB active resource
                <0x0 0x7e700000 0x0 0x1000>, /* MCB A resource */
                <0x0 0x7e720000 0x0 0x1000>, /* MCB B resource */
                <0x0 0x7e800000 0x0 0x1000>, /* MCU 0 resource */
                <0x0 0x7e840000 0x0 0x1000>, /* MCU 1 resource */
                <0x0 0x7e880000 0x0 0x1000>, /* MCU 2 resource */
                <0x0 0x7e8c0000 0x0 0x1000>, /* MCU 3 resource */
                <0x0 0x7c000000 0x0 0x200000>, /* CPU 0 domain for L1 and L2 */
                <0x0 0x7c200000 0x0 0x200000>, /* CPU 1 domain for L1 and L2 */
                <0x0 0x7c400000 0x0 0x200000>, /* CPU 2 domain for L1 and L2 */
                <0x0 0x7c600000 0x0 0x200000>, /* CPU 3 domain for L1 and L2 */
                <0x0 0x7e600000 0x0 0x1000>, /* L3 resource */
                <0x0 0x7e930000 0x0 0x1000>, /* SoC bus resource */
                <0x0 0x7e000000 0x0 0x1000>, /* SoC device resource */
      interrupts = <0x0 0x20 0x4>,
                       <0x0 0x21 0x4>,
                       <0x0 0x27 0x4>;
};

Arnd, Rob, and Borislav, Please comment and let me know.
