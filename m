The rate dependance is only a *potential* issue.  I suspect that a
value of 4 should be functional for all rates and chips.  The only
trade off is more DMA requests/bursts.

In a typical 15 word fifo, 48kHz, stereo, single fifo DMA system,  the
old value was 15-2 = 13, which would mean 7385 13-word DMA
bursts/second.    A new value of 4 would mean 24,000 4-word DMA
bursts/second.

Is that consequential for anybody?  It's about the same total
bandwidth on the system, but just broken up into smaller chunks (I
don't know what the overhead is for a DMA burst)

In a high channel count system (16 channels @ 48kHz), the old value
doesn't work, and the new value would mean 192,000 4-word DMA
bursts/second, which works on my MX6.  So given that 192000 works
fine, I'm not sure that the difference in a typical system would
matter at all.

If nobody objects, we can just set the value to 4 and be done with it.

Another question:  is the watermark ever going to be different than
maxburst?  Is there any reason to have them different?
