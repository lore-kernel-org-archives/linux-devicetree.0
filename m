Thanks Geert.

Palmer, in future, you can ensure (most) relevant parties are Cc'd by
using scripts/get_maintainer.pl to find them, and adding Cc: lines to
the relevant patches.

You can either hand that a patch or a path, e.g.

[mark@leverpostej:~/src/linux]% ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl -f Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/

So IIUC those interrupts are routed directly to the HLIC, and are (only)
controlled thought the HLIC?

Is the HLIC architecturally mandated? i.e. is this guaranteed to be
present on any RISC-V implementation?

Does the presence of the HLIC imply the presence of a PLIC (or
vice/versa)? Typically, the per-cpu and platform-wide parts of the
top-level interrupt controller are fairly intimately coupled.

You'll need to allocate the "riscv" vendor prefix in 
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/vendor-prefixes.txt

... if that was done in some other patch, I didn't receive it.

What about the flags?

Are all HLIC interrupts edge triggered (or level triggered)?

We can probably replace most of these with a "...", as they're largely
irrelevany to this binding.

Do you mean that the PLIC is connected to the HLIC, or that the HLIC is
also managed in part through CSRs?

As with the HLIC, what about the flags?

Why do we need to know this?

I suspect this ia actually the number of interrupts implemented in the
PLIC, rather than the number of interrupts attached. i.e. the PLIC can
be implemented with a subset of the potential registers/bits. Is that
correct?

If so, something like "riscv,num-interrupts" would be better, along with
a clearer description.

> > +- interrupts-extended : Specifies which contexts are connected to the PLIC

That description doesn't sound right.

I take it that these are the HLIC interrupts that the PLIC can raise?

You will need to be explicit about the order of interrupts in this
property. i.e. which interrupt is routed to which context?

Is the interrupt at the HLIC well known? From the example I see that
here local interrupts 11 adn 9 are used. Is that mandated, or just the
case for this particular implementation?

Also, please consider how you will handle the case when the Linux
logical CPU ID is not the same as the physical ID, and how you will
handle physical IDs being sparse.

We went though a lot of pain trying to do something similar for the ARM
PMU interrupts (see the interrupt-affinity property in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/pmu.txt), and it's still painful
to deal with.

This can go, given you don't have sub-nodes, nor a #size-cells property.

Thanks,
Mark.
