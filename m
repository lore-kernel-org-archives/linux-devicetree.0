It is not about to "check" the DT but if Linux could get access to the hardware.
Hardware block assignment to secure or non-secure world could change at runtime
for example I2C block could be manage by secure OS for a trusted
application and when
it have finish "release" the it for Linux. I don't think that could be
done by changing DT.

I think that dhecking hardware blocks status bits before probe them is
also more robust than let
each driver discover at probe time that it hardware isn't responding.
