Shouldn't img prefix to help against this? We can sure use another name 
though like "img,axd-audio-decoder" or something like that. I'll need to 
check.

AXD and host cores exchange interrupts using GIC interrupt controller. 
To configure AXD firmware to send and listen to the correct GIC 
interrupts we need these values, hence this property.

If there's a way to reverse the irq mappings of 'interrupts' property 
from the driver code we can get rid of that and have 2 interrupts 
properties instead. But as far as I can see there's no way to get the hw 
irq value from the mapped linux irq unless I missed something.

VPE is MIPS notation of hardware thread. Instead of being a complete 
separate core AXD can run as a hardware thread (VPE) inside a Linux 
core. This number indicates which hardware thread to run AXD at.

We use CMA to allocate this buffer area. This optional property is there 
to give the user a chance to use larger/smaller buffers if they think 
they need to. This buffer area is shared between Linux and AXD to 
exchange data.
