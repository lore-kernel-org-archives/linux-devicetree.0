Thanks I have queued this up after addressing some issues
in the changelog that checkpatch complained about:

* text > 75 characters wide
* Missing '"' around name of patch referred to

Its looking like there is already quite a log shared between
r8a7791-porter.dts and r8a7791-henninger.dts. Do you have any
thoughts on consolidating or sharing common elements between
them somehow?
