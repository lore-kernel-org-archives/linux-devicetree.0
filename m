I haven't explicitly checked, so I don't know. My argument was
admittedly entirely theoretical.

I think that nvidia,phy-reset-gpio is exactly what we're talking about here.

Yes, certainly. If for nothing else than "legacy" bindings:-) But I
think explicit properties are a perfectly reasonable approach even going
forward.
