The clock source selection is done by a register bit inside the IP block:
BIT13 CLKSRC CAN Engine Clock Source
0b - The CAN engine clock source is the oscillator clock.=20
1b - The CAN engine clock source is the peripheral clock.

Currently it's written 1 by default during driver initialization.
drivers/net/can/flexcan.c
/* select "bus clock", chip must be disabled */
reg =3D priv->read(&regs->ctrl);
reg |=3D FLEXCAN_CTRL_CLK_SRC;
priv->write(reg, &regs->ctrl);

I'm not sure if it's a typical case to abstract CLKSRC bit into a common cl=
ock mux.
(Is there any similar case in kernel?)
But I think we can also use SoC specific compatible to write 0 for those sp=
ecial
Ones (currently only imx8qxp). Then this patch may not be needed.

Marc,
Please let us know if you have a different idea.
