Why you have two same extcon phandler? From my mind, one should id,
another should is vbus. Besides, I find extcon-usb-gpio.c is lack of
vbus support, how you support vbus detection for
connection/disconnection with PC for your chipidea msm patch set?

Not needed. You only need to describe controller, mux ic, and hub 
(if you need platform stuffs the driver needs to know).
