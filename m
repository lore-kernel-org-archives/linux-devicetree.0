I checked this some time ago, when I started to look at the sunxi clock code.
For all the devices (sun6/7/8i) I've checked, the system is configured to use
the external 32.768k oscillator.

I agree. I will look at the BROM (for sun4/7i) and boot0 (sun6i) for signs of
when it is configured. Then we can determine if we need to implement it
somewhere.
