Sure! I can do that in next version!

These values of MAJOR MINOR and STEP are defined as part of IP spec. And 
most of the QCom IPs follow such scheme. We can read back these values 
from the Hardware registers.

Having SoC Names here might not be very efficient here.
We have used such compatibles on may QCom IPs, like BAM DMA, SLIMBus and 
other drivers.

Up to 15 data ports in total

Thanks, Looks like I missed that here.

it should be something like this,

#address-cells = <2>;
#size-cells = <0>;

Will add the in next version.
