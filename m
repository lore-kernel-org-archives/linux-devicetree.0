I don't think this is a problem. The device ptr would only point to
the platform device. Nothing else is going to know about the ptr,
modify it nor expect that it points to the same struct device that
contains the of_node ptr.

So I think any instances of struct device like this are ones you don't
care about for purposes of probe dependencies.
