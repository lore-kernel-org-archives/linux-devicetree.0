The problem I'm trying to solve is the following:

We have platforms out there which still use both board files and
device tree. They are still comercially supported and are not going
anywhere anytime soon. Some of these platforms are being actively
maintained and cleaned-up. An example is the DaVinci platform: David
has recently converted all the SoCs and boards to using the common
clock framework. I'm cleaning up some other parts too.

The problem with the legacy board code is that a lot of things that
should be platform drivers ended up in arch/arm/mach-*. We're now
slowly moving this code to drivers/ but some initialization code
(timers, critical clocks, irqs) needs to be called early in the boot
sequence.

When you're saying that we already have all the OF_DECLARE macros, it
seems to me that you're forgetting that we also want to keep
supporting the board files. So without the early platform drivers we
need to use a mix of OF_DECLARE and handcrafted initialization in
arch/arm/mach-* since we can't call platform_device_register() that
early. This blocks us from completely moving the should-be-driver code
to drivers/, because these drivers *need* to support both cases.

The main problem with OF_DECLARE is that although we have
corresponding device nodes, we never actually register any real linux
devices. If we add to this the fact that current early platform
drivers implementation is broken (for reasons I mentioned in the cover
letter) the support gets really messy, since we can have up to three
entry points to the driver's code. Other issues come to mind as well:
if we're using OF_DECLARE we can't benefit from devm* routines.

My aim is to provide a clean, robust and generic way of probing
certain devices early and then converting them to actual platform
devices when we're advanced enough into the boot sequence. If we
merged such a framework, we could work towards removing both the
previous early platform devices (in favor of the new mechanism) and
maybe even deprecating and replacing OF_DECLARE(), since we could
simply early probe the DT drivers. Personally I see OF_DECLARE as a
bigger hack than early devices.

My patch tries to address exactly the use cases we're facing - for
example by providing means to probe devices twice (early and late) and
to check the state we're at in order for users to be able to just do
the critical initialization early on and then continue with regular
stuff later.
