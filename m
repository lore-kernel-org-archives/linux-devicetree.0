Just for the record: KVM guests are a typical example of an "always-on"
timer implementation (irrespective of the host implementation - it is
all virtual). Furthermore, the fact that they usually don't have another
timer to provide timekeeping in presence of C3STOP timers prevents the
kernel from using hrtimers.

We then end up in the situation where we force the timers to generate a
100Hz timer interrupt in a situation where using hrtimers and NO_HZ
would be the most beneficial (and perfectly valid).

I did a quick test with this patch (and the obvious kvmtool hack to add
this property to the timer node), and noticed a 10-fold reduction in
context-switches on the host for a single 4-vcpu guest that was
otherwise *idle*!

So a massive thumb-up from my side.

Cheers,

	M.
