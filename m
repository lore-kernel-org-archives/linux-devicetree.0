Arnd, Greg,

  Perhaps you have some ideas WRT programmables (PLDs/CPLDs/FPGAs)?

Probably best to hold off your reply until you get home then.  It's
not just a formatting issue, you also exposed many raw email addresses
to the internet, which are easily harvested up by web crawlers.

I don't think this is correct either.  CPLD handling would probably be
slightly less out of place in drivers/misc, but perhaps a new
subsystem for PLDs/CPLDs/FPGAs would be more appropriate
drivers/programmables or similar maybe.

I'm pretty convinced that it doesn't belong in MFD now, but it doesn't
mean I'm going to leave you on the curb.  I'd like to help you get it
into a better home.

I had a conversation about this on IRC yesterday and some good
points/questions were posed.  This is a difficult area, because you
can program these things to do whatever you like.  Depending on the
'intention' (and it is only an intention -- someone else can come
along and reprogram these devices on a whim), the CPLD code could live
anywhere.  If you wanted to put watchdog functionality in there, then
there is an argument for it to live in drivers/watchdog, etc etc.  So
just because the plan is to support a few (i.e. more than one) simple
devices, it doesn't necessarily mean that the handling should be done
in MFD.

Yesterday I was asked "Are you wanting to restrict drivers in
drivers/mfd to those that make use of MFD_CORE functionality?".  My
answer to that was "No, however; I only want devices which
_intrinsically_ operate in multiple subsystems", which these
programmables no not do.

=46YI, you're not on your own here.  There is at least one of these
devices in the kernel already and upon a short inspection there
appears to be a number of Out-of-Tree (OoT) drivers out there which
will require a home in Mainline sooner or later.
