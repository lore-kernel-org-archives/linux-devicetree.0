You have vendor prefixes on all the properties so I don't think a
collision is really a problem. It's also an established pattern in
i.MX WEIM and OMAP GPMC (which are hiding in bindings/bus/) and I
prefer consistency.

Now you are giving yet another definition of what missing means.
Please pick and document one:
- Error, property missing
- Normal mode
- Retain firmware/bootloader settings (this should probably apply to
all or none)

The last is really the only reason I agree with for not doing a boolean.
