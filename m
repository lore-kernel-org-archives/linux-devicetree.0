The "problem" is non-existent because either CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC is off
or where it is used is limited (memory and cpus on PSeries) and now
overlays. Overlays have the potential to be problematic, but we should
manage ref counting for overlays in a completely different way. What
that looks like, I don't know. I'll leave that to the person that
cares about removing overlays.

I've got no idea if this is right or not.

SPARC. Stay away.

Step 2 after figuring out it can't be documented is "define a new way
to handle dynamic DT refcounting aka how to get rid of
of_node_get/put."
