The example is section E.8 seems to say otherwise. Perhaps Mark R can
comment further.

Yeah, I believe the only way to prevent access within non-secure world
is with the MMU. So I guess the example is just policy that the
hypervisor would/may not create a stage2 mapping. You still have the
same issue that the guest should not be passed the control base. You
could make the reg property optional, but then what do you do with the
node name?

Certainly the guest dtb will be different.
