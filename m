Got it.
There is function of_xlate in reset_controller_dev can parse the dts
when devm_reset_control_get

* @of_xlate: translation function to translate from specifier as found 
in the
*            device tree to id as given to the reset control ops

Will use this instead.

Yes, we can use multiple reset lines, which is also our original method.
But it may have too many reset lines, like pcie driver will have 5 resets.
So just thinking it can be optimized.

However, when using of_xlate, parsing offset & bit to rstc->id (unsigned 
int),
It only support u32, so will use bit numbers again.
rstc_id = rcdev->of_xlate(rcdev, &args);

Will update v3 patch, help take a look.
