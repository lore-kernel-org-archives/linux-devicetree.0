The user is responsible for configuring the pipeline. It is thus not
unreasonable to as the user to configure the frame rate as well if there are
device in the pipeline that can affect the frame rate. The way I proposed to
implement it is compliant with the existing API and entirely deterministic,
contrary to what you're saying.

It's not the job of the CSI sub-device to figure it out.

S_PARM and G_PARM function as interface on the V4L2 API to access the frame
rate on plain V4L2 devices. The i.MX6 IPU is not a plain V4L2 device.
Essentially the V4L2 device node you have there is an interface to a rather
plain DMA engine, no more.

There have been plans to add device profiles to the documentation but that
work has not yet been done.
