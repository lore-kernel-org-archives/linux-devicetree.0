Jean-Jacques,

I take the 4-9 patches in my at91-3.15-cleanup branch with my "Acked-by".

The first ones shall be re-posted independently:
- for the matrix, we need to convert all SoC DT before adding a "panic"
statement if the SoC doesn't have a matrix entry. I am pretty confident
to have these bits in for 3.15 anyway.
- for the pinctrl, we need to cook the idea a little bit more and have
Linus' acknowledgement.

Thanks a lot for you work. Bye.
