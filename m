Ok, that is indeed not clear from the code but your explanation makes
perfect sense, thanks!

My point was that I don't think we need devices here at all. It's different
when you talk to external hardware that has register resource etc that
can be best abstracted as a real device, but for other firmware features
we don't normally add one.

Module unloading can also be done without the device.

I think it will work if you don't clean them up, but it feels wrong
to have a loadable module that creates devices when loaded but doesn't
remove them when unloaded.

This could be done differently by having the device creation done in
one driver and the the user of that device in another driver, but I
think just killing off the device achieves the same in a simpler way.

Ok, then maybe the "compatible" identifier in DT should be sufficient
to ensure that the capability exchange works, and the rest be based
on that?

We tend to avoid version checks for APIs in the kernel because they
never work in practice, but the capability check should be fine.

Ok, I see.
