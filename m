The AC100 codec chip is very much like the A33's audio codec, except it has
additional clocks and resets, being a separate chip and all.

The manual has a diagram for the clock tree. This should help you understand
and extrapolate how the A33  audio codec's clocks are wired up.

This particular instance works, and it implies some of the dependencies.
Though maybe you could rename it as "ADC Digital Enable", to
differentiate from other ADC-related widgets.

I think you could have "Digital Left/Right ADC" ADC widgets on the digital
side. Then in the device tree you could hook up "Digital Left/Right ADC"
with "Left/Right ADC".
