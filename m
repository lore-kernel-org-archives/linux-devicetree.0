As per comments in bindings patch: this is a duplicate of your new
attribute you added to the regulator core.  Makes no sense to have a
private attribute too with the same value.

As per comments in the bindings patch, I think we should move
"qcom,drms-mode-max-microamps" to the regulator core.

As per comments in bindings patch: seems like we should get rid of
"qcom,regulator-initial-microvolt" or move to the core.

As per comments in other threads, adjust this comment and use
-ENOTRECOVERABLE now.


NOTE: I think this driver is looking really good now.  Hopefully the
above things should be quick to spin (even getting "max-microamps" in
the core should be quick I think)  and we can get something landed!
:)
