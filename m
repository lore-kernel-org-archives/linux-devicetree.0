indeed, so in simple words we would need something like
reset_control_do_once(rstc, RESET/ASSERT/DEASSERT) which would
remember internally if any action has already been executed: if not it
does a _reset, _assert or _deassert and otherwise it does nothing.

I added Philipp and Hans to this thread - maybe they can comment on this.
To sum it up, our problem is:
- there are two separate USB PHYs on Meson GXBB
- both are sharing the same reset line (provided by the reset-meson driver)
- during initialization of the PHYs we must only call
reset_control_reset(rstc) once (if we do it for the first *and* second
PHY then the first PHY gets confused once the second PHY uses the
reset because the first PHY's state is reset as well)
