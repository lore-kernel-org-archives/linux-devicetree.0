Shawn, everyone:

This series includes changes made to device-tree in order to support
PCIe on i.MX7 platform. They include:

     - Bringing 'anatop-enable-bit' property of ANATOP regulators back
       and extending it to all of the HW it is applicable to

     - Adding GPCv2 node for i.MX7 (which was missing, despite the
       irqchip driver for it being in the tree for quite some time)

     - Adding a PCIe node for i.MX7

     - Adding GPIO expander used by PCIe and enabling PCIe node from
       above on i.MX7 based Sabre board

As usual, feedback is welcome.

Thanks,
Andrey Smrinov
