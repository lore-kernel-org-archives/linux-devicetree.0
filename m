Can you explain how the decision is made whether the IOMMU gets used
or not? In all cases I've seen so far, I think we can hardwire this
in DT, and only expose one or the other. Are both ways used
concurrently?

This looks rather complicated to parse automatically in the generic
DT code when we try to decide which dma_map_ops to use. We'd have
to look for 'slave' nodes in each device we instatiate and then see
if they use an iommu or not.

I'd rather have a device-specific property that tells the driver
about things the iommu driver doesn't need to know but the master
does. In most cases, we should be fine without a name attached to the
slave.
