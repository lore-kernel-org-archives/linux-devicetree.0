This patch series adds a driver and device tree binding documentation for
PMIC regulator control via Resource Power Manager-hardened (RPMh) on some
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SoCs such as SDM845.  RPMh is a hardware block
which contains several accelerators which are used to manage various
hardware resources that are shared between the processors of the SoC.  The
final hardware state of a regulator is determined within RPMh by performing
max aggregation of the requests made by all of the processors.

The RPMh regulator driver depends upon the RPMh driver [1] and command DB
driver [2] which are both still undergoing review.  It also depends upon
two recent of_regulator changes: [3] and [4].

Changes since v2 [5]:
 - Replaced '_' with '-' in device tree supply property names
 - Renamed qcom_rpmh-regulator.c to be qcom-rpmh-regulator.c
 - Updated various DT property names to use "microvolt" and "microamp"
 - Moved allowed modes constraint specification out of the driver [4]
 - Replaced rpmh_client with device pointer to match new RPMh API [1]
 - Corrected drms mode threshold checking
 - Initialized voltage_selector to -EINVAL when not specified in DT
 - Added constants for PMIC regulator hardware modes
 - Corrected type sign of mode mapping tables
 - Made variable names for mode arrays plural
 - Simplified Kconfig depends on
 - Removed unnecessary constants and struct fields
 - Added some descriptive comments

Changes since v1 [6]:
 - Addressed review feedback from Doug, Mark, and Stephen
 - Replaced set_voltage()/get_voltage() callbacks with set_voltage_sel()/
   get_voltage_sel()
 - Added set_bypass()/get_bypass() callbacks for BOB pass-through mode
   control
 - Removed top-level PMIC data structures
 - Removed initialization variables from structs and passed them as
   function parameters
 - Removed various comments and error messages
 - Simplified mode handling
 - Refactored per-PMIC rpmh-regulator data specification
 - Simplified probe function
 - Moved header into DT patch
 - Removed redundant property listings from DT binding documentation
