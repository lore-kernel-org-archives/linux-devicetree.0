Sorry, I somehow missed these bindings are for Exynos4 only.

Anyway, there is rather little chance to have uniform drive strength
representation across all Samsung SoC. It's sometimes expressed in mA,
sometimes has no units. Perhaps it's best to stick with HW reg. values,
however it is some times confusing as hell...


For instance, for exynos4 we have:

driver strength | 1x   | 2x   | 3x   | 4x
---------------------------------------------
register value  | 0x00 | 0x2  | 0x01 | 0x03


for s3c6410:

driver strength | 2mA  | 4mA  | 7 mA | 9 mA
---------------------------------------------
register value  | 0x00 | 0x2  | 0x01 | 0x03


Nevertheless, I think, for exynos4 the effort to have actual drive strength
directly expressed in DT description, rather than using not entirely sane
HW values, is rather small.
And it could save a bit of frustration for all these poor engineers trying
to use the API..

Sure, that's understood. It's fine for me to get those things fixed any time
for 3.2 stable release.
