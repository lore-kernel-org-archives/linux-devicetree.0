Subject: [PATCH 00/11] CPU enable method based SMP/hotplug + MSM conversion

This is a rework of patches sent a few months back by Rohit[1].
The goal of these patches is to add support for SMP and (basic)
hotplug on MSM based SoCs. To get there, we add support for a
generic way to add SMP/hotplug support code in the kernel. To
show how it's used, we convert the MSM8660 SMP support code over
to the new method. After that we add support for the rest of the
upstream MSM SoCs (note these patches are piled high on top of
Rohit's patches to add 8074 support to MSM[2] and my follow ups[3,4],
but this should only matter to the MSM maintainers).

This is one of the last items of code that still requires us to have
a mach directory and a machine descriptor. We should be able to move
the hotplug/smp code out of mach directories if this approach is
accepted.
