These are in addition or instead of the first 3 clocks.
CRO: This is in addition of the first 3 clocks, I will modified my comment:

You need to list the names. Seems unrelated to MPU support.

        + Should be "macirq" for the main MAC IT
        + Should be "eth_wake_irq" for the IT which wake up system

The clock is always connected whether you use it or not, right? So it shouldn't be optional based on use.
CRO: Yes the clock is always connected but it is not necessary to enable it if you have phy with quartz (it will not use)
So it is optional.

Boolean?
CRO: Yes

Is it ok ?
