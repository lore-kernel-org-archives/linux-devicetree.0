Fixed.

Numbers added.

In this case the mic bias comes out of the chip trough a separate pin 
and it is up to board designer to connect it with any (or all) of the 
three mic pins.

Similar approach is used at least in wm8400.c, wm8990.c, wm8991.c, and 
in ab8500-codec.c. But I see your point. I'll roll back that change. I 
moved the clock enable/disable code to set_bias_level() to avoid 
unwanted behavior (codec clocks not turning on at playback/capture start 
if damp switches are not set correctly).

After adding the clock enable/disable code to set_bias_level, it started 
to look hairy when everything was inlined. I split the set_power 
function to *_on and *_off functions.

In addition to these, after rebasing on top of linux-next branch, I 
started to use use the new SOC_DOUBLE_R_S_TLV macro for the signed 
integer mixers.
