Hi Loic,

as mentioned in my other email, I would really add an example on how to format this. Especially since these are formatted in little-endian order. So adding an example of “00:11:22:33:44:55” string representation on how it converts to [ 55 44 33 22 11 00 ] would be super helpful.

It might also be useful to create a generic bluetooth.txt similar to ethernet.txt. And then just reference it from here.

Of course we need to have Rob sign off on this and also make sure the boot loader people get this done correctly.

Regards

Marcel
