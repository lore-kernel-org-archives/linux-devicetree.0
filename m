The code in gpio-leds.c and gpio_keys_polled.c refers to "gpios" as the
property name. If we can change that somehow to work with con_id-gpio
instead without breaking things, then why not.

Only reason I can think of is support for the existing properties that
are used directly. Drivers using gpiod_get() and friends do not need
dev_get_named_gpiod_from_child() anyway.
