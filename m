>From what I know of this hardware, it's going to be rather difficult to
concoct a DT which reflects the initial hardware state accurately *and*
works correctly without updating u-boot in lockstep. IIRC, I believe the
accurate description for an unprogrammed LUT would be "everything comes
out on the default ID, which defaults to 0", i.e.:

	iommu-map-mask = <0x0>;
	iommu-map = <0x0 &smmu 0x0 0x1>;

(assuming the SMMU has stream-id-mask set appropriately too)

That's OK except if u-boot updates the map without removing the mask,
whereupon things will go wrong, and I guess that would be the case with
current u-boot :(

However, the existing MSI description is already bogus - if u-boot
didn't program the LUT, the ITS driver would treat the invalid
"msi-parent" property as this:

	msi-map = <0x0 &its 0x0 0xffff>;

which means that nobody other than 0:0.0 has working MSIs anyway.

If you want an obviously-invalid placeholder equivalent to the use of
"msi-parent" then I'd suggest just:

	iommus = <&smmu>;

which would be ignored by Linux for PCI devices, so provided you didn't
disable bypass at the SMMU things might in theory still work in the
"u-boot does nothing" case. Otherwise, the implied identity map is
probably slightly preferable to the unit-length map, i.e.:

	iommu-map = <0x0 &smmu 0x0 0xffff>;

which is at least equally broken as MSIs in the same situation.

Robin.
