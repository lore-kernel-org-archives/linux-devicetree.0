Surely, "fsl,<soc-name>-<rev>-msi" can describe this?

If the hardware differs, it needs a new compatible string.

If there's some configuration value that varies across revisions (e.g.
number of slots), you can add a proeprty to describe that explciitly.

This is not necessary, and does not represent a real block of hardware.
So NAK for this approach.

The msi-parent property can contain a list of MSI controllers. See the
examples in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/msi.txt.
Likewise, the msi-map property can map to a number of MSI controllers.

If the core code can only consider one at a time, then that's an issue
to be addressed in core code, not one to be bodged around in bindings.

This breaks old DTBs, and throws away information which you describe
above as valuable. So another NAK for that.

Also, as above, the approach of gathering MSI controllers in this manner
is wrong.

Thanks,
