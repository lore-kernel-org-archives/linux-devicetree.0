cpu normally need strict voltages. and only proved operating opints
are allowed to set in dts. If the voltage changes slightly especially
for high frequency, it's easy to cause unstable.

As I said, only proved operation points are allowed.

Yes.

right.

It's pure software. platform uses this driver have to define "cpu" consumer.

I'll check it.

Why? Do you think only errors and warnings can print out?

Thanks
