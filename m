Microblaze has it currently out of RO section.
This patch is adding it there.

I have looked at powerpc flow which is probably the closest to our versio=
n.

head.S
Saving dtb pointer to r31 then initial_mmu which setups 16MB tlb for kern=
el
then some exception and calling machine_init()->early_init_devtree()
->move_device_tree() where also change initial_boot_params location
for unflatten_device_tree() in setup_arch().

Ben: I didn't find any TLB entry for DTB itself.
Does it mean that I missed it or that powerpc can access in machine_init(=
)
the whole memory space?

Thanks,
Michal
