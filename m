how about simply "capture" ?

Right, the "direct" IPU internal (that do not transfer buffers to/from
memory via IDMAC channels) should only allow the IPU internal
formats YUVA and RGBA. I get you now.

The "direct" pads now only accept MEDIA_BUS_FMT_AYUV8_1X32 and
MEDIA_BUS_FMT_ARGB8888_1X32.

Those pads are:

ipu_csi:1
ipu_vdic:1
ipu_ic_prp:0
ipu_ic_prp:1
ipu_ic_prpenc:0
ipu_ic_prpenc:1
ipu_ic_prpvf:0
ipu_ic_prpvf:1

ipu_csi1 is now transferring on IDMAC/SMFC channel 2 (ipu_csi0 still
at channel 0).

Actually there are problems using this, see below.

I tried this API, by switching to v4l2_pipeline_pm_use() in camif 
open/release,
and switched to v4l2_pipeline_link_notify() instead of 
imx_media_link_notify()
in the media driver's media_device_ops.

This API assumes the video device has an open file handle while the media
links are being established. This doesn't work for me, I want to be able to
establish the links using 'media-ctl -l', and that won't work unless 
there is an
open file handle on the video capture device node.

Also, I looked into calling v4l2_pipeline_pm_use() during 
imx_media_link_notify(),
instead of imx_media_pipeline_set_power(). Again there are problems with 
that.

First, v4l2_pipeline_pm_use() acquires the graph mutex, so it can't be 
called inside
link_notify which already acquires that lock. The header for this 
function also
clearly states it should only be called in open/release.

Second, ignoring the above locking issue for a moment, 
v4l2_pipeline_pm_use()
will call s_power on the sensor _first_, then the mipi csi-2 s_power, 
when executing
media-ctl -l '"ov5640 1-003c":0 -> "imx6-mipi-csi2":0[1]'. Which is the 
wrong order.
In my version which enforces the correct power on order, the mipi csi-2 
s_power
is called first in that link setup, followed by the sensor.

done! A very simple change to imx_media_add_internal_subdevs(),
and now no CSI's are necessary, but the remaining IPU internal entities
are loaded and linked just fine without them, so for example with no
CSI's in IPU2, the VDIC entity in IPU2 is still present in the graph and
could still be used in the future by a mem2mem device for instance.
