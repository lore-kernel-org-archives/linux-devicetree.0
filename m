Given the special needs of the touchscreen I do not think that that is a good idea.

For i2c based sensors the plan is to use devicetree overlays + an in kernel
overlay manager which probes the i2c bus (checking known touchscreen / accelerometer
addresses) and then picks the right touchscreen + accelerometer overlays.

Wifi is somewhat more tricky I must admit, esp. since there seem to be q8 a23 based
tablet variants with usb wifi and others with sdio wifi. Since both busses are
discoverable I'm tempted to just enable both in devicetree, and let the kernel probe
and see what is actually there. This assume that the way the wifichip is powered
is the same on all boards, or at least that it is safe to enable the necessary
regulators on all boards ...

So this means enabled the sdio controller (should be safe on all boards?) and
enabling 2 regulators to power the wifi-chip. I think it will be safe to do this
even on boards where those regulators are not used, what do you think ?
