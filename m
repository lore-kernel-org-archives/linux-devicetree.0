Beware beware.

The DT should of course describe the hardware as accurately as possible.  
That doesn't necessarily mean it should describe the hardware as 
_extensively_ as possible.

And that doesn't mean that all the information found in the DT has to be 
consumed by the kernel either.

Any information that can be *probed* at run time has no benefit being 
stuffed in a DT.  That's true whether it is Linux or another operating 
system.  The more that can be probed at run time the better.
