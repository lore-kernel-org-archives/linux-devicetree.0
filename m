For the existing ROM, as that stands, certainly. I appreciate it's older
than SMCCC.

That *is* a move away from compliance, as an SMCCC-compliant TEE should
not look at r12, and an SMCCC-compliant client can (and will) leave
arbitrary values in r12.

Given that one can build a multi-platform kernel, parts of the DT have
already been parsed (in order to determine that the machine is an OMAP2)
before any of this is executed.

These are not too early to preclude runtime switching based on the DT.

I can appreciate that it's a pain to have to alter these, but it's
certainly possible, and it would eliminate the problem rather than
spreading it further.

... and so the DT can also be altered to describe a new SMCCC-compliant
set of OMAP2 SMCs in this case.

Thanks,
Mark.
