No, it's for cases like this (see the cubietruck4 or a80-optimus dts
patches):

			reg_bldo4: bldo4 {
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1080000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1320000>;
				regulator-name = "vcc12-hsic";
			};

The regulator can do 1100000 uV, 1200000 uV and 1300000 uV, all of which
are within the constraints, so obviously the constraints can be satisfied,
yet the regulator core fails do so with a message like this:

vcc12-hsic: Bringing 700000uV into 1080000-1080000uV
vcc12-hsic: failed to apply 1080000-1080000uV constraint(-22).

I've run into the same bug trying to support the CX-A99 board, which uses an
AXP808 PMIC [1], which seems to be very similar to the AXP 806. The patch
fixes the bug by rounding the constraints to voltages which are supported by
the regulator. Output from dmesg on my CX-A99 board looks like this:

[    2.577202] vcc12-hsic: Bringing 700000uV into 1080000-1320000uV
[    2.583335] vcc12-hsic: override min_uV, 1080000 -> 1100000
[    2.589003] vcc12-hsic: override max_uV, 1320000 -> 1300000
[    2.594673] vcc12-hsic: 1100 <--> 1300 mV at 1100 mV 

[1] Details on which will be happily accepted, btw.
