You can do this now. You would just add something like this to the board's
.dts file:

	& ref_clk {
		clock-frequency = <30000000>; /* 30 MHz */
	};

Boards with an oscillator don't need to do anything since that is the
default. Boards with clock will need to do this:

	&pll0 {
		ti,clkmode-square-wave;
	};

I'll sleep on it. Like you, I could go either way. I'm temped to just leave
it as-is though (with some added comments for clarification, of course).
