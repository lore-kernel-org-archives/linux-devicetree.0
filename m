Thanks for your patience.

Since there are two instances of the CCU IP block and the clk_branchs[]
table contain branch clocks from both of them the driver needs to know
on which CCU instance the clocks belong.

So just registering all clocks in clk_branchs[] we would end up with
all the clocks on both CCU nodes and some clock ids would conflict.

An alternative approach could be to split the clk_branchs[]. Each one
with branch clocks for the respective CCU. But the driver would still
need to know which of the tables to register. This could be done either
by using two DT compac strings; like "nxp,lpc1850-ccu1" and "...-ccu2"
or by having a 'id' propery in DT. I don't find these two approaches
very appealing.

So the reason for some of the complexity in the driver is to keep it
generic and work on multiple CCU instances by looking at the connected
clocks.

I hope this make it more understandable. Sorry for failing to describe the
hardware properly.

Either way I'll send out a v4 with parent clocks in the clk_branchs[]
and which use a clock-names property to match the clocks between the
CCU. Let me know what you think when you get a chance to look at it.

I don't mind putting the parent clock names in the clk_branches[] but
the driver still needs to distinguish between the CCUs in the system
and register the correct clocks on them.

If you have a another good way of doing so I am all ears.


I have put up the full DT in the link if you would like to take a look.

You may also find the data sheet at the link below. There is a figure
of the CGU and both CCUs at page 161, Figure 34.
