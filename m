This UART example is not quite representative for the issues I have been
trying to address with this patch set. There is a need to set (an initial)
input clock frequency. E.g. in case of multimedia devices there may be
a need to set clock parent and frequency of an input clock to multiple IP
blocks, so they are clocked synchronously and data is carried properly
across a whole processing chain. Thus there may not be even clock output
in an IP block, but still input clock needs to be set. IIUC there is
similar issue with audio, where it is difficult to calculate the clock
frequencies/determine parent clocks in individual drivers algorithmically.

I'm not sure we must always consider the parent information as property
of a clock source. If for example we expose a structure like below as
single clock object, supporting clock gating, parent and frequency
setting the parent setting is still accessible from within a device
driver. And clock parent selection may depend on a system configuration
not immediately obvious from within a single device driver perspective.

I believe even clock controllers where clocks are represented as flat
array often describe the clock tree entirely by parenthood, the tree
structure is just not obvious from the DT binding.
In addition, there seems to be appearing more and more clock controller
DT bindings describing their clocks individually.

When this issue was first raised during an ARM kernel summit it was
proposed to add 'assigned' prefix to DT properties for such bindings.

How about separate properties for the default clock configuration,
e.g. assigned-clocks/assigned-clock-parents/assigned-clock-rates ?
So a clock provider would look like:

    clkcon {
        ...
        #clock-cells = <1>;

        assigned-clocks = <&clkcon 16>, <&clkcon 17>;
        assigned-clock-parents = <0>, <&clkcon 1>;
        assigned-clock-rates = <200000>;
    };

And a consumer device node:

    uart@a000 {
        compatible = "fsl,imx-uart";
        reg = <0xa000 0x1000>;
        ...
        clocks = <&clkcon 0>;
        clock-names = "baud";

        assigned-clocks = <&clkcon 3>, <&clkcon 0>;
        assigned-clock-parents = <&pll 1>;
        assigned-clock-rates = <0>, <460800>;
};

?
