A10s is the same SoC as A13 / R8, just in a different package / with
different pins routed to the outside and it features a parallel LCD
interface just like the A13 / R8. We've had this confirmed by
Allwinner multiple times now, A13 / A10s / R8 literary are the same
chip, there simply is no way the displayblock on the A10s somehow
is magically different.

Given all this, clearly having this identical displayblock in the
shared sun5i.dtsi is the right thing to do.

Hans
