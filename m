This patch series adds support for M_CAN on the TI Dra76
platform. Device tree patches will be sent separately.
A bunch of patches were sent before by
Franklin Cooper <fcooper@ti.com>. I have clubbed the
series together and rebased to the latest kernel.

v6 changes:
Dropped the patches to make hclk optional. Drivers
which enable hclk as the interface clock using
pm_runtime calls must still provide a hclk in the
clocks property.

Support higher speed CAN-FD bitrate:
The community decided that data sampling point be used
for the secondary sampling point here
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9909845/

Franklin S Cooper Jr (6):
  can: dev: Add support for limiting configured bitrate
  can: m_can: Add call to of_can_transceiver
  can: m_can: Add PM Runtime
  can: m_can: Support higher speed CAN-FD bitrates
  dt-bindings: can: m_can: Document new can transceiver binding
  dt-bindings: can: can-transceiver: Document new binding
