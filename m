Keystone2 devices are used on more platforms than just Texas
Instruments reference evaluation platforms called EVMs. Providing a
generic compatible "ti,keystone" is not sufficient to differentiate
various SoC definitions possible on various platforms for the
following reasons:
a) Userspace applications have no way of knowing which SoC they are
functioning, providing the compatible matches provide a mechanism for
them to enable SoC specific functionality. Such userspace applications
are typically automated test framework or SoC custom hardware
acceleration entitlement from a common file system.
b) Provides an accurate hardware description. This allows
SoC specific logic to be run time handled based on
of_machine_is_compatible("ti,k2hk") or as needed for the dependent
processor instead of needing to use board dependent compatibles that
are needed now.

Hence, provide compatible matches for each SoC in the Keystone family.

Changes since V2:
	- elaborated reasoning why this change is useful - highlighted
	  potential userspace usage as well.
	- picked up Acked-by from Murali
