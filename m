I think there is a bit of miss-understanding with 'dma-coherent'
DT property and as RMK pointed out "dma-coherent-outer" isn't
right direction either.

I agree with Russell. When I added "dma-coherent" per device DT
property, the intention was to distinguish certain devices which may
not be coherent sitting on coherent fabric for some hardware reasons.

Exactly. We should leave the "dma-coherent" property to mark coherent
vs non coherent device(s).

The inner vs outer is really page table ARCH setup issue and should
be handled exactly the way it was done first place to handle the
special memory view(outside 4 GB).

Keystone needs outer shared bit set while setting up MMU pages
which is best done in MMU off mode while recreating the new
page tables.
