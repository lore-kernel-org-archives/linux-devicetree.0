This is not exactly what I have written, but this all looks like a drag

If I put those HW facts in my original patch before you stated them,
it is obviously because they strongly guide the partitioning, so I will
skip that (except for c) which I address below).

I, along with most people I believe, would choose to use what makes most
sense ;).
If you insist on asserting this particular scheme makes most sense and
that is the reason it is used:
- First obviously, if you didn't provision the NAND, I wouldn't provide
  a partition, no matter your desiderata (if I saw your scheme was the
  one making the most sense I would though), would you ?
- Isn't it a matter of preserving the factory-shipped u-boot ?
- Next, you are reserving ~0xa0000 space for U-Boot which itself is
  several 100KBs for the boot ROM to jump to, can't you imagine someone
  else using way less space for an SPL ? Advantages include less chance
  to corrupt the 1st piece of SW the HW jumps to and proper U-Boot (or
  whatever) mirroring.

Some digression:
This morning I hesitated to send a patch to choose a proper OOB layout,
here's what the sprab41e.pdf (BootROM info for OMAP-L132/L138) I found
on the net states wrt OOB layout:
"Each segment of spare bytes contains 6 test bytes and 10 ECC
bytes. For those pages that are checked during bad block detection, all
the test bytes in each segment must equal FFh; any other value indicates
that the page (and its entire block) is bad and should not be used."
U-Boot has a provision to use this scheme, (although it doesn't really
match since it considers the 3 last segment 'test bytes' as free).
What I found is that it is only used for one board only and keystone has
a compile time define to use said layout while having to pay attention
that Linux is using a layout like nand_ooblayout_lp_ops. What makes even
less sense, is that the Linux driver still uses the 10bytes<->8bytes
(un)packing scheme unconditionally which is of no use except for saving
2 bytes per OOB 'section' (ie. 2 bytes / 512 bytes data) which moreover
would otherwise not be used and have no use except for compatibility
with the boot ROM. This has been the case for years.
What also made little sense is how you put during the nand DTS addition
that you would not accept 1bit ECC to switch to 4bit ECC right-away,
while ECC issues have been registered in TI forums with such issues for
years, and is also a 1 (among 17) entries in the MTD section of
bugzilla.kernel.org.
I think I have also raised some other issues along our recent exchanges.

This digression to say that it is a little bit difficult to eat such
nits while reading your "partitioning scheme is used because it makes
most sense.", and not getting a tad annoyed.

I can't remember the name of this guy who said, if you want to drag
research today, just grant more money, but via comitees, I guess it's
the same in many other areas.  It might well be something else, such
nits are sometimes just a pretext, though if they are bona fide, it's
all to your credit to take upon yourself that they might seem so.

It is not comfortable to doubt the attitude of a maintainer but it is
even less so to see them abusing their prerogatives, and do nothing
about it.

On my side I can't thrive on such things, especially what we are
presently discussing so I'll pass.

Thanks, 
Karl
