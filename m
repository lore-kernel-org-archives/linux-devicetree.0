ah! Sorry, the rate is fixed for the stream. So it varies for what rate is 
being used.

Sorry about that.

The CS42L52 has multiple input selections for microphones. Single-ended 
and differential inputs are allowed for both Left Channel (MICA) and Right 
Channel (MICB). The +- pins can be used for stereo or mono mics.

Thank you very much. I will take a look at this now.

Thanks again,
