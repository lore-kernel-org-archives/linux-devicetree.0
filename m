This patch set introduce new Cadence USBSS DRD driver
to linux kernel.

The Cadence USBSS DRD Driver s a highly
configurable IP Core which can be
instantiated as Dual-Role Device (DRD),
Peripheral Only and Host Only (XHCI)
configurations.

The current driver has been validated with
FPGA burned. We have support for PCIe
bus, which is used on FPGA prototyping.

The host site of USBSS controller is compliance
with XHCI specification, so it works with
standard XHCI linux driver.

Changes since v2:
- made some text correction in Kconfig file as suggested by Randy Dunlap.
- simplified Makefile as suggested by Peter Chan.
- removed phy-names from dt-binding as suggested Rob Herring.
- changed cdns3-usb.txt to cdns3-usb3.txt as suggested by Rob Herring.
- added checking error code in some function in drd.c file 
  as suggested by Peter Chan.
- added reg-names to dt-binding documentation as suggested by Chunfeng Yun.
- replaced platform_get_resource with platform_get_resource_byname.
- made other changes suggested by Chunfeng Yun.
- fixed bug in cdns3_get_id. Now function return id instead 1.
- added trace_cdns3_log trace event.
- simplify cdns3_disable_write function.
- create separate patch for work around related with blocking endpoint 
  issue.
- Fixed issue related with stale data address in TRB. 
  Issue: At some situations, the controller may get stale data address
  in TRB at below sequences:
  1. Controller read TRB includes data address.
  2. Software updates TRBs includes data address and Cycle bit.
  3. Controller read TRB which includes Cycle bit.
  4. DMA run with stale data address.
- Fixed issue without transfer. In some cases not all interrupts
  disabled in Hard IRQ was enabled in Soft Irq.
- Modified LFPS minimal U1 Exit time for controller revision 0x00024505.
- Fixed issue - in some case selected endpoint was unexpectedly changed.
- Fixed issue - after clearing halted endpoint transfer was not started.
- Fixed issue - in some case driver send ACK instead STALL in status phase.
- Fixed issues related to dequeue request.
- Fixed incorrect operator in cdns3_ep_run_transfer function.

Changes since v1:
 - Removed not implemented Suspend/Resume functions.
 - Fixed some issues in debugging related functions.
 - Added trace_cdns3_request_handled marker.
 - Added support for Isochronous transfer. 
 - Added some additional descriptions.
 - Fixed compilation error in cdns3_gadget_ep_disable.
 - Added detection of device controller version at runtime.
 - Upgraded dt-binding documentation.
 - Deleted ENOSYS from phy initialization section. It should be also removed
   from generic PHY driver.
 - added ep0_stage flag used during enumeration process.
 - Fixed issue with TEST MODE.
 - Added one common function for finish control transfer.
 - Separated some decoding function from dwc3 driver to common library file,
   and removed equivalents function from debug.h file as suggested  by Felipe.
 - replaced function name cdns3_gadget_unconfig with cdns3_hw_reset_eps_config.
 - Improved algorithm fixing hardware issue related to blocking endpoints.
   This issue is related to on-chip shared FIFO buffers for OUT packets. 
   Problem was reported by Peter Chan.
 - Changed organization of endpoint array in cdns3_device object.  
      - added ep0 to common eps array
      - removed cdns3_free_trb_pool and cdns3_ep_addr_to_bit_pos macros.
      - removed ep0_trb_dma, ep0_trb fields from cdns3_device.
 - Removed ep0_request and ep_nums fields from cdns3_device.
 - Other minor changes according with Felipe suggestion.
