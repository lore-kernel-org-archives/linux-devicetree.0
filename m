We are taking about two things here.

1: "Setting the correct mode for the user space binary file."
	This is only possible if the entire eeprom/nvmem has write protection. 
We could get that info from 2 places. One having a new DT property 
bindings like "read-only" as Rob suggested.
	or
	Second, scan the regmap for writeable attributes and the correct file 
mode. For this option AFAIK, with existing regmap code we can only do 
this by scanning the entire range, which is bad I guess.

2: "Returning appropriate error codes to user space."
	This is already addressed in the existing code, regmap would return an 
(-EIO) I/O error Or error codes from providers in cases where an write 
attempt to non writable register/or something wrong is made and the 
*same error* code is passed back to user too. All the error codes from 
regmap/provider layer are always passed back to the user space. These 
error code, I supposed are fine grained originating from the low layer.


I think with "read-only" property and returning same error codes from 
regmap/provider layer to user-space would address the points raised by Matt.

Thanks for the inputs.


The exiting regmap writeable_register api will only return true or 
false. But if the provider implements its own read/writes functions, the 
error-codes from these apis would be passed back to user anyway, so the 
user can make informed policy decisions. This logic already present in 
with the exiting eeprom/regmap code.
