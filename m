I am aware of those nvmem framework patches by Srinivas, however from what
I can see that framework has not been merged yet atleast from the mail
chain that I see for v5 of the patchset so I have not properly looked into
that. Mark Brown did apply the regmap patches to his tree, but has the rest
of the framework been merged or is it expected to be merged?

If it is expected to be merged and if that framework is a fit for what we
are trying to do here and it seems so on a quick glance, then I can go with
that. However I still did like to hear from Arnd or have some more comments
before I go for that approach with the next respin.
