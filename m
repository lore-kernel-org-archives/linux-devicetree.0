Because it is the PHY_BASE offset within the _indirect_ register
access trough AHCI registers.

Nope, the reg property is correct and describes the (vendor-specific)
AHCI registers that are used for indirect access to PHY registers. When
writing to PHY registers, BG2 and BG2Q are different with respect to
the PHY_BASE address offset that has to be passed to indirect address
register.

The above is basically equivalent to the node match that I added with
this patch series. I can, of course, use above compatible match instead
of passing the phy_base in the of_device_id's .data.
