I mean you can have DMA channel numbers visible in the device
tree, relative to a 'parent' dma controller, but I would not
expose them as numbers on a device driver interface. Instead,
I think the interface we provide to the device driver is one
where we pass the device using the DMA channel into a generic
dmaengine API and let that figure out where it's connected
in order to return a struct dma_chan pointer.
