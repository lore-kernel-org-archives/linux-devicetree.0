I might have misread both of your mails, but I think you two are
actually in agreement. You both support a common property which lists
the always-on clocks inside of the common clock binding, no?

This should pose no burden on the driver. Since always-on-clks is in th=
e
common clock binding it should be handled by the framework core. At
clk_register-time we can check for always-on-clks, walk the list and se=
e
if we have a match. It's ugly O(n^2) but it works.

Thoughts?
