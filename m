The Allwinner A10/A20 SoCs have an on-board CAN (Controller Area Network)
controller. This patch adds the CAN core to the SoC's include files,
sun4i-a10.dtsi and sun7i-a20.dtsi.

On linux-can mailing list was a discussion about updating the device tree bindings
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/9/17/220
but it did not progress past writing the documentation file.
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/can/sun4i_can.txt

The CAN controller can be enabled in a board specific dts file as
described in the documentation file or by using a device tree overlay.

I have tested the patch on a Banana Pi (A20 SoC) with mainline kernel 4.10.5.

History:
    v4: fixed style problems,
        changed device node position of ps20 and ps21 to fix ordering
        by rising physical address

    v3: added "allwinner,sun7i-a20-can" compatible to can0 device node contents,
        make separate patches for device nodes and pinctrl settings

    v2: changed can0_pins_a node contents to new generic binding method, 
	changed can0_pins_a node position by alphabetical order,
        changed can0 device node position by rising physical address order

    v1: initial
