The XDMA engine embedded in the AST2500 SOC performs PCI DMA operations
between the SOC (acting as a BMC) and a host processor in a server.

This series adds a driver to control the XDMA engine in order to easily
perform DMA operations to and from the host processor.

I previously sent this series v1 to drivers/misc, but I'm now fairly certain
it belongs in drivers/soc, especially since the other Aspeed drivers have been
moved to soc.

Changes since v1:
 - Correct the XDMA command pitch
 - Don't use packed for the aspeed_xdma_op structure
 - Correct the SCU PCI config change
