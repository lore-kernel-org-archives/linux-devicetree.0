Not sure how that could even look, it would need to be in DT as only
that layer knows the connections, but then the it would also have to
have internal knowledge of the widgets used in the driver..

Then only time this could happen is if they specified MICBIAS_OFF in DT
but got the default 2v instead. In which case, yes, the behavior would
change, but it would also be changing to the correct behavior. We can't
avoid fixing code on the off chance someone depended on the broken
behavior, no progress could ever be made.
