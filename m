Somewhere in here can you give some context of what VRM and XOB stand
for.  From the other patch desc it's "voltage regulator manager (VRM)
and oscillator buffer (XOB)", but nice to sprinkle that around the
first time it's used in documents.

...and, ummmmm, what's an oscillator buffer?  Is this really a
regulator?  It sounds a lot more like a clock enable knob.  Are you
sure this shouldn't be exposed through the common clock framework?
Many other PMICs expose oscillator clocks through CCF.  MAX77686 comes
to mind.

Probably don't need to include "regulator-name" since you say below
"Other properties defined in regulator.txt may also be used" and this
isn't anything special for your regulator.

regulator-min-microvolt / regulator-max-microvolt are really required?
 What happens if you leave them off?  In general the regulator
framework supports this concept--it just lets you enable/disable
without changing voltage.

The "supported values" here is a strange statement to make.  Not all
regulators will support all those voltages, right?  Do you really need
to list this here?

Explicitly state whether this is allowed even if
"regulator-allow-set-load" is not set.

It would be up to Mark Brown, but my guess is that he will say "please
add this to the core".  The regulator core already has the concept of
modes and you're already using the standard core concepts in most
places.  Get rid of the special case code in your driver and add this
to the core.

As far as I can tell this sorting constraint should be removed.
Really the constraints should be:

* qcom,mode-threshold-currents should be sorted from lowest to highest
* qcom,allowed-modes must match qcom,mode-threshold-currents

Sure, today it happens that the numbers are always lower for lower
currents, but it doesn't seem like something you'd have to encode into
the dt.

Is this just "regulator-microvolt-offset", but supported in hardware?

I still don't have the big picture I guess, but it seems weird that
you can override this.  You're saying that someone might stick an
oscillator buffer the place of something that's normally a regulator?
...or a regulator in the place of something that's usually an
oscillator buffer?  When would you use this?
