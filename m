Ah ok. The version here is mostly about specifying some minimum
version or greater that the dtb matches against. If we were to
actually put the real version we may need more blobs for the
different combinations of board and SoC versions. So perhaps
leaving that in compatible string is the right way to go?

Presumably the bootloader finds the matching size compatible
element and then populates the memory info that just happens to
match the same size. I don't know if this is happening, but it
certainly seems possible to have the same memory size at
different starting addresses. So we could simplify that situation
by having one size in the compatible that works for either
starting address. In summary, I don't

Urgh. I converted dtbtool to python to make it simpler and avoid
that compilation step. I guess I'll explore wrapping some calls
to the C library inside dtbtool itself for this particular
purpose. It would be nice though if I could get a python object
for the root of the unflattened dtb that could be iterated and
inspected. I'll take a look at doing that sometime.

I'm thinking the aliases would be something like this:

	usid0 = <&pmic0>;
	usid2 = <&pmic1>;
	usid4 = <&pmic2>;
	usid6 = <&pmic3>;

We could specify usid1,3,5,7 too, but they're the same as the
0,2,4,6 ones.

So far I think all that will change is dropping the mb/panel
elements and parsing the PMIC ids from compatible strings and DT
traversal. Sounds right?
