If for some bizarre reason one was to run Linux on M4 and use A7 as
applications processor, resetting A7 might be useful. But that's a
very unlikely use-case.

IMHO because it is unused code and because those numbers constitute an
interface which once set will be hard to change if need be.

But that's not that important and I don't feel particularly strong
about that point, so I'll add those sources in v3.

Do you insist that I split what I call IMX7_RESET_PCIEPHY into
PCIEPHY_G_RST and PCIEPHY_BTN or can I keep it as a single logical
reset?

Oh, yes, that's right. Missed that the datasheet spells "button" explicitly.

USBPHY1/2 and maybe MIPI resets? But that's no more than a gut feeling.
