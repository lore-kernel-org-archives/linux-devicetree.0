This patch series enhances the current EDAC driver to support different
platforms. This series adds support for ZynqMP DDRC controller in synopsys
EDAC driver. This series also adds Device tree properties and relevant
binding documentation.

Changes in v2:
	- Moved checking of DDR_ECC_INTR_SUPPORT from (1/4) to (3/4) as it is
	  a feature of ZynqMP DDRC
	- The Binding Documentation in (2/4) is modified as per the review
	  comments

Changes in v3:
	- The commit message in (2/4) is modified (Synopsys EDAC Driver -->
	  ZynqMP DDRC)

Changes in v4:
	- Updated the commit message in (1/4)
	- Renamed function pointer names removing 'synps_' in (1/4)
	- Shortened unnecessary long lines as per the review comment on (1/4)

Changes in v5:
	- Updated the commit message in (2/4) and (4/4).
	- Removed the unnecessary check for match data in probe() in (1/4)
	- Some Indentation changes for better readability in (1/4) and (3/4)
	- Removed repeated code in (3/4)
	- Used 'zynq' and 'zynqmp' instead of 'synps_enh_edac' in function names

Changes in v6:
	- Splitted the patches according to functionalities
	- Addressed code style comments from v5 review
	- Moved the Error Injection to CONFIG_EDAC_DEBUG mode

Changes in v7:
	- Included DTS patch (6/7) which was missed in v6 patch set
