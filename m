I guess that would be ARCH_SINGLE_ARMV7M?

In my view, that wouldn't end up being much different than what that
patchset is doing:
With the introduction of ARCH_MULTI_V7M, we add something like a top
level v7M compliant selection. Due to the !MMU dependencies of all other
CPU families the family selection is minimal (when selecting !MMU):

    *** CPU Core family selection *** 
[*] ARMv7-M based platforms (Cortex-M)

And since ARCH_MULTI_V7M is not part of ARCH_MULTI_V6_V7 or anything,
the whole SoC selection contains only sensible SoC's without further
changes (also within the i.MX family, currently only "Vybrid Family
VF610 support" is selectable):

[ ] MMU-based Paged Memory Management Support                       
    ARM system type (Allow multiple platforms to be selected)  ---> 
    Multiple platform selection  --->                               
[*] Energy Micro efm32                                              
[*] Freescale i.MX family  --->    
    *** Processor Type ***
...

As far as I can tell, this is already the case with that patchset.

The differences boil down to on which level we split the v7M CPU
selection apart: On ARCH_* level or ARCH_MULTI_* level. Given that we
allow a multiplatform _v7M kernel, the latter sounds more natural to
me...

Are there arguments to split v7M CPU selection apart on ARCH_* level
which I don't see?
