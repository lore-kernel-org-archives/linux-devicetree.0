These are queued for v4.19.

As the device node now has a power-domains property, the genpd code will
try to attach it to the CPG/MSSR PM Domain, which is a clock domain.
In the absence of the clock patch, the device's module clock cannot be
found, and dev_pm_domain_attach() and thus platform_drv_probe() will fail,
before calling the device driver's .probe() function.

So there is no longer a dependency on the clock patch, and the DT patch can
go in in parallel (although I prefer its subject to be changed
s/binding/device device/).

Thanks!
