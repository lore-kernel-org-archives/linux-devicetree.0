Yeah, I thought I'd just ask alsa first, rather than send to DT
maintainers.  Is it preferable to just send to everybody that
get_maintainers spits out even for an RFC?

As for optimal settings, I finally came to a setting of 4 for depth &
maxburst, which will result in more DMA requests, but it's the only
way that works at 48kHz for me.  The default settings is 13 (15 - 2)
for the ones of the 15 item fifo, which is a pretty dramatic
difference.  I just don't know if other chips will behave badly in
that case.

I'd be happy to just submit a patch that sets it to 4 if we think
that's the right way to go.
