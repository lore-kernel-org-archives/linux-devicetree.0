I first want to say I don't see anything wrong with such a super node.
As you say, it does describe hardware. But I also want to say that I
still don't see a need for it. Or, maybe more exactly, I don't see a
need for it in general. Maybe there are certain cases where two devices
has to be controlled by a master device. Maybe this one is one of those.

In the imx case, why wouldn't this work, without any master node, with
the IPU nodes separate in the DT data:

- One IPU enabled, one disabled: nothing special here, just set the
other IPU to status=3D"disabled" in the DT data. The driver for the
enabled IPU would register the required DRM entities.

- Two IPUs as separate units: almost the same as above, but both would
independently register the DRM entities.

- Two IPUs in combined mode:

Pick one IPU as the master, and one as slave. Link the IPU nodes in DT
data with phandles, say: master=3D<&ipu1> on the slave IPU and
slave=3D<&ipu0> on the master.

The master one will register the DRM entities, and the slave one will
just do what the master says.

As for the probe time "are we ready yet?" problem, the IPU driver can
just delay registering the DRM entities until all the nodes in its graph
have been probed. The component helpers can probably be used here.

No disagreement there. I'm mostly put off by the naming. The binding doc
says it's a "DRM master device", compatible with "fsl,imx-drm". Now,
naming may not be the most important thing in the world, but I'd rather
use generic terms, not linux driver stack names.

Yes, that's an annoying problem, we have that on OMAP. It's a clear sign
that our video support is rather messed up.

My opinion is that the fbdev and drm drivers for a single hardware
should be exclusive at compile time. We don't allow multiple drivers for
single device for other subsystems either, do we? Eventually we should
have only one driver for one hardware device.

If that's not possible, then the drivers in question could have an
option to enable or disable themselves, passed via the kernel command
line, so that the user can select which subsystem to use.

Well, generally speaking, I think one option is to treat the two
controllers separately and let the userspace handle it. That may or may
not be viable, depending on the hardware, but to me it resembles very
much a PC with two video cards.

If you want the two controllers to operate together more closely, you
always need special code for that particular case.

This is what CDF has been trying to accomplish: individual drivers for
each display entity, connected together via ports and endpoints. Driver
for Epson LCD controller would expose an API, that can be used handle
the LCD controller, it wouldn't make any other demands on how it's used,
is it part of DRM or fbdev, what's before or after it, etc.

Now, and I think this was your point, some kind of master device/driver
is needed to register the required DRM or fbdev entities. Usually that
can be the driver for the SoCs display controller, i.e. the first
display entity in the display pipeline. Sometimes, if it's required to
have multiple devices act together, it may be a driver specifically
designed for that purpose.

So no, I don't have a problem with master device nodes in DT. I have a
problem having pure SW stack nomenclature in the DT data (or even worse,
SW stack entities in the DT data), and I have a problem requiring
everyone to have a master device node if it's only needed for special cas=
es.

And yes, this series is about IMX bindings, not generic ones. And I'm
also fine with requiring everyone to have a master device node, if it
can be shown that it's the only sensible approach.
