Oh, good - someone fixed the core code for that without me noticing.
Last time I looked if you made the strings const there were annoying
warnings since they got passed in to things that weren't expecting const
strings and it seemed to annoying to check that it was actually safe in
all cases.

Like I say I'm perfectly aware of the issues, I just don't have much
enthusiasm myself since they pretty much only affect unrealistic and
apparently quite rare randconfigs - the time I might spend on that is
more likely to get spent on things like the format negotiation stuff.
If someone (you? :P) wants to do the work that's fine but nobody had
shown any sign of that until your driver the other day. =20

I do also want to see some explicit conversion happening so it's clearer
that this is a deliberate change that's being rolled out.
