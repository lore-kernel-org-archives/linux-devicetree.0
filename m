My understanding of SSC is it is required for hosts and optional for 
drives to support (from first hand experience of a host not enabling). 
Not setting this is would not be compliant. The polarity on this is 
somewhat backwards too as the common case should be no property.

Anyway, that's all besides the point of your change. I assume it doesn't 
apply here for you because it is always enabled.
