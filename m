Bindings are for h/w, not drivers

Please reword this to not be u-boot or kernel specific.

Maybe this node is enabled in the bootloader or the OS can just read the 
registers to see if ECC is enabled. The latter is more future proof if 
you need to access the DDR ctrl registers for other reasons.

That sounds strange. Normally, the memory would be 72-bits wide to hold 
the ECC byte for each 64-bit chunk. It would be inefficient to access 
the ECC byte in a discontiguous location. In any case, none of this is 
really important for the binding.

Don't show status in examples.
