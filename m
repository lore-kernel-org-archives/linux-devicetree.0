In PXA27x, GPIO controller control both GPIO & pin alternate function. The
alternate function is covered by GAFRx registers.

At first, we need to move GAFRx from gpio-pxa driver. Then we can support
it by pinctrl-single driver since pinctrl-single driver could support mulitple
pins in one pin registers. There's "bits-per-mux" property in pinctrl-single
driver.

Not exactly. pinctrl-single driver could support multiple pins in one register.
Now Manjunathappa also fixed some issue in pinctrl-single for supporting
multiple pins. (https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/5/21/226) I suggest you to develop
based on his patches.
