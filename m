A way to solve this problem could be to create only one card builder.
This creation could be explicit (created by the first active audio
controller) or implicit by the audio subsystem on the first controller =
or
CODEC creation.

Then, the card builder could scan all the DT looking for the audio
ports and create one or more cards according to the graph connectivity.

I know what are the widgets and routes, I was just wondering why they
(especially the widgets) need to appear at the card level instead of
just being declared in the DAIs (from the platform or the DT).
And the same question may also be raised about the audio formats, clock=
s,
tdm's...

I may go back about the card builder, but Russell's idea about
declaring the tda998x audio parameters by a port as declared in a graph
of ports seems fine to me. This declaration should be compatible with
the use of the simple-card.
