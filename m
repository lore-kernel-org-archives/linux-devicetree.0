I would prefer to remove it right now.
Removing NAP from c-state table makes the hikey960 working correctly;
I mean even with current ATF and current state id. So it's the best
solution to the NAP problem IMO and I don't see the benefit of keeping
NAP in the table until this state has been fixed. This will just add
uncertainties in the behavior of the board.
I don't see why you can't re-add it once it has been fixed.

And that's my main concern because this adds a new possible regression
factor when switching between different kernel version
