Luckily I do have the datasheet for the audio-glue sysconf register.

It says: -

[11:8] PCM_CLK_SEL: Selects the frequency synthesizer clock or the external
PCM clock for each channel.

The driver only ever sets this to 1 which selects the frequency synthesizer
clock. So the bitfield of the register which the driver is using (PCM_CLK_SEL)
is a clock mux.
