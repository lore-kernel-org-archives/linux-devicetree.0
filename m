The majority of these properties look like they constrained to the
device in question, so make sense for _DSD too.

However...

This property should never be present on an ACPI system. RTAS is a
completely different firmware interface on PowerPC.

As a general note, I would hope that we're not going to blindly convert
drivers and subsystems over to a common property interface without
considering each property w.r.t. the particular FW interface.=20

Each addition to _DSD, especially if through a common accessor needs
_more_ scrutiny than is applied to DT bindings, and we hardly manage to
review DT bindings.
