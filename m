Right now there is no guarantee heap IDs will be the same across
platforms. The heap IDs are currently part of the userspace ABI
as well since userspace clients must pass in a mask of the heap
IDs to allocate from. If we assume all existing clients could change,
heaps such as the system heap could be mandated to have the same
heap ID but we'd still run into problems if you have multiple
heaps of the same type (e.g. multiple carveouts)

An alternative might be to have each heap just be a compatible string
and pull everything (id, type etc.) into C files for setup. I debated
doing that but decided to try putting everything in DT for my first
pass.

I think we could probably derive most of it from the memory-region right
now. If it's reusable, it's DMA, if not it goes to a carveout. Name can
come from the node name. heap ID and whether or not a region is a chunk
heap could be added as properties.

We'd still need to be able to get the same information for heaps that
don't correspond to a specific region like the system heap.
