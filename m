Really, this is your argument?

Agreed.

What other functions do you have? You previously said the block was DFT 
registers which I would not expect s/w to ever touch.

And you could have other types of consumers. Nothing requires nodes and 
providers to be 1-1.

You're being told to do it this way by multiple maintainers both because 
it is the preferred way to describe clocks and it gives a better chance 
for stable bindings.
