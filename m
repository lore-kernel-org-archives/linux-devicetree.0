mute and standby pins are available on the codec. If they are connected, they
should be managed by the driver, instead of relying on gpio hogs or on the
initial state of the GPIOs.

This series also includes a patch to improve the start-up time of the channels
by disabling built-in DC diagnostics. Those diagnosdtics basically serve to
detect :
- wires shorted together
- wire shorted to ground or vbat
- wire disconnected
This is not useful for all platforms and the addition to the startup time is
quite noticeable (230ms).
