Hello,

This patch set adds CCF drivers for the clocks found in the Renesas R-Car
R8A7790 (H2) SoC.

The patches are pretty self-explanatory and described in their respective
commit message. The R8A7790 datasheet is unfortunately not publicly available.

The code is available in my git tree at

	git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/fbdev.git clocks/ccf/r8a7790

The branch is based on a merge of renesas-devel-20131016, v3.12-rc7 and
multiarch drivers and clk-prepare patches I've posted earlier today. A full
DT description of the R8A7790 clocks is available in the clocks/ccf/lager
branch of the same repository (see "ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Add clocks" and
"ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Reference clocks" patches).
