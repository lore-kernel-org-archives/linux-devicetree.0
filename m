So MAC address would be a valid use to link to a h/w device, but there
are certainly cases that don't correspond to a device.

Agreed. I'm not saying the layout should not be.

It can describe the layout completely whether the fields are tied to a
h/w device or not.

What I would like to see here is the entire layout described covering
both types of fields.
