We'll post patches as soon as they're ready.

By the way, do you know if the H3 and newer SoCs use a different PHY from 
Synopsys, or a custom PHY developed by Allwinner ?

I don't really see a problem with that, we have many drivers in the kernel 
that have been developed through reverse-engineering. You should not include 
large pieces of code that have been obtained through decompilation of a 
proprietary binary blob as those could be protected by copyright, but writing 
to undocumented registers based on information found through usage of a binary 
driver isn't a problem. (Please remember that I'm not a lawyer though)
