 ok so i've got this now in
http://hands.com/~lkcl/allwinner_linux_proposal.txt - that leaves...
well there's quite a bit: usb, sd/mmc (both variants: they changed the
data structures around sun5i), nand (probably both - the allwinner one
and the mtd one being done, reminds me: we need full documentation on
the NAND chip), scsi, g2d - cedarx and more.

 what else should be raised, and to what benefit?
