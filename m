Good to know this. Will use this way to connect code with spec.

Mike Leach has gave method in another email to check CPU power state in
register EDPRSR.PU before access EDPCSR register.

For security state, I will check if EDSCR.NS bit can be use to
distinguish CPU is secure or non-secure state. And also follow Mike's
suggestion to use EDPCSR = 0xFFFF_FFFF as hint that the CPU is in
secure state.

IIUC, external debugger also will access these registers, like use
EDPCSR to display PC value. I have no idea for the connection between
this driver with external debugger, except I think we can use this
driver to enable clock for CPU debug module.

Will do.

I copied the code piece from coresight-etm4x.c.

I guess here is to ensure the os unlock operations is finished before
any sequential register accessing. I think isb() is redundant for
debug module and we can only use writel_relaxed() will be enough for
accessing EDOSLAR and EDPCSR, these two registers are in the same
endpoint so we don't need add extra barrier for them. Is this correct?

Eventually this is a hardware feature, right? If so we can use one DT
property to describe this.

Have checked this, does not introduce deadlock.

We don't need know particular CPU for current driver; but I think the
amba id is different for different CPU variants. Should I remove
related binding for this?
