Thats right. The only defending argument is that the event codes are specific
to the DynamIQ, unlike the COMMON_EVENTS which matches the ARMv8 PMU event codes.
So, someone would need to carefully find the event code for a particular event.
Having these entries would make it easier for the user to do the profiling.

Also, future revisions of the DSU could potentially expose more events. So there
wouldn't be any way to tell the user (provided there aren't any changes to the
programming model and we decide to reuse the same compatible string) what we *could*
potentially support. In short, this is not a problem at the moment and we could
do something about it as and when required.

Thats just to let the user know the CPUs bound to this PMU instance.

Ah, you're right. We don't need to do a select register operation here.

Agreed, I was in double mind about the name, myself.

But, we have to make sure we are reading the events from a CPU within this
DSU in case we have multiple DSU units. In any case, reading it from a CPU
outside the active cpumask is a tighter check. I will change it.

Yes, you're right. I will clean it up.

OK, I will remove it.

Good point. Initial version of the driver used to ignore the failures, but
was changed later. I will roll it back.

We should at least have one counter implemented (excluding the cycle counter).
And yes, we should check if the num_counters <= 31.

Did you mean to use "force"d affinity settings ? If so, modules
don't have the luxury of doing that. Hence this one. I think that also
brings up the problem where we could be reading the counters from
a different CPU than we requested. So, I think it would be good to keep
the CPU check, wherever we could access the PMU.
