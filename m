My point was not that everything would be good if we change the kernel
this way, it clearly wouldn't. I think the problem is more the parts
for which neither an automated translation nor a unified driver level
interface would work well.

Yes, but remember that Intel still have the problem on their embedded
systems, and will want to solve them.

For ARM Linux I agree that we're better off not having to change all
the drivers again for this, but we will have a growing number of
drivers that are shared with ACPI based x86 SoCs. At least there are
only one or two vendors of those chips ;-)

I'm skeptical about getting people to ship both, except if they
want to support multiple operating systems. For those vendors
we are talking to, we are possibly able to convince them to drop
ACPI for Linux based servers. The bigger problem is system vendors
we don't talk to. They are going to to do any number of crazy things
in their private kernels:

* Board files
* Hardcoded platform devices with no multiplatform support
* Custom hypervisor (EL2 or EL3) interfaces for probing
* FEX
* ACPI
* Some other firmware ported over from their MIPS products
* Incompatible Open Firmware
* Incompatible DT extensions
* ...

The only thing we really have a handle on is stuff that gets submitted
for inclusion into Linux. One would hope that this would include
any server platform, but I think the people trying get into that
market are still learning about how to do these things.
