Hi,

Thank you for the review.

I am not sure. I have forwarded a question internally and based on the
answer will either drop this or add a common function and post a patch
add the check to all 3DES implementation.

This has been added to the staging TODO list for the driver.

Will fix. Added to TODO staging list for the driver.

That is a very good question. I am guessing this has something to do
to with this driver spending its life out of tree and being maintained
against old kernel versions that may have had some gaps in FIPS
testing and since fixed.

I will review what, if at all, is missing from testmgr and fold those
missing parts (if found) there and drop this from the driver.

No it isn't. What ever the behavior we need it should be added,
pending review of course, to the generic FIPS logic handling.

I do wonder if there is value in alternate behavior of stopping crypto
API on FIPS error rather than a panic though. I will try to get an
explanation why we do it this way.

Handling all these has been added to the driver staging TODO list and
will be handled before it matures into drivers/crypto/

Many thanks for the review!
