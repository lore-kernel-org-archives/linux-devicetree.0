I would also add, in the choices I (we?) don't want

(d) custom driver-specific solutions that will break when the next version of 
the SoC is released.

I started looking into DT bindings for my DRM drivers more than a year ago. It 
started with the simple task of creating bindings for panels, but it quickly 
became clear (to me at least) that the issue was much bigger than that. This 
is what prompted me to work on the Common Display Framework (CDF) that you 
might have heard about.

Please note that the idea behind CDF isn't DT-centric, its main goal is to 
offer a (hopefully clean and simple) way to handle composite hardware devices 
that are so common in the embedded world, using one driver per chip and/or IP 
core (there's no *requirement* to split the SoC hardware support code in 
multiple drivers in CDF, but it allows doing so when the SoC is made of 
generic IP cores that are reused in different composite devices - a good 
example of that is a video scaler that can be instantiated in a display 
pipeline and a camera pipeline).

I haven't been able to spend as much time on CDF as I would have liked to so 
far, but I haven't given up. I would be more than happy to discuss this during 
ELC-E/KS if you would like.
