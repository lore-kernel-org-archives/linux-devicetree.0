So what I think is that any such mechanism would defy the idea
with device tree providing all platform configuration, including
the ASIC/SoC variant.

The only not-so-unelegant idea I have is for the machine to
go in and fiddle with the device tree, e.g. add some info into
the tree somewhere stating into the nodes which ASIC variant
it is. Maybe even modify the compatible value at runtime.

But it somehow feels like cracking an egg with a sledgehammer.

I think we need to meditate on this.
