Ah yes, I should have paid attention to the mkdir.

Fair enough. Like I said, it was only a preference and certainly not
unprecedented. I'll just get less receptive with each addition. :)

When and by whom do you propose merging this?

The only other comment I would have is at some point, we're going to
have overlays that aren't tied to any arch. Where are we going to put
those? Maybe they are tied to some vendor which tends to have most
stuff in $arch and we just continue this band-aid. Or we define some
common location. I bring this up now only because both could use that
location.
