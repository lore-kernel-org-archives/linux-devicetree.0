Let me remind you that I had a definition of what a front end and a back
end DAI was from Liam, and your definition is at odds with that.

I am still of the opinion that you don't know what you're talking about
most of the time, and nothing has changed in that regard, and I still
regard you as a completely  obstructive and unhelpful person.

And I think you're just wrong on what you've said above.  But... I've
basically given up any hope of progressing that code after months of
pissing around with your obstructive attitude, and I've elected (and
others) to maintain it completely out of mainline for the forseeable
future - hopefully until you get replaced by someone who can be more
assistive and helpful.
