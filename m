Rob's main concern was finding a way to pass the constraint from HW definit=
ion
to arch without widening fdt's architecture specific function surface. I'd =
say
it's fair to argue that having a generic mechanism makes sense as it'll now
traverse multiple archs and subsystems.

I get adding globals like this is not very appealing, yet I went with it as=
 it
was the easier to integrate with arm's code. Any alternative suggestions?

Is it safe to assume DMA limitations will always be a power of 2? I ask as =
RPi4
kinda isn't: ZONE_DMA is 0x3c000000 bytes big, I'm approximating the zone m=
ask
to 30 as [0x3c000000 0x3fffffff] isn't defined as memory so it's unlikely t=
hat
we=C2=B4ll encounter buffers there. But I don't know how it could affect mm
initialization code.

This also rules out 'zone_dma_bits' as a mechanism to pass ZONE_DMA's size =
from
HW definition code to arch's.
