Do we really have to specify a new property to select the mode ?
The existing DT will have to be modified anyway, so maybe we can just
add a new compatible string differentiate those two modes.

Also note that if you're doing linear interpolation between the points
specified in the voltage-table instead of doing it on the min -> max
values, you wouldn't have to modify the binding.

Why are you introducing another random unit. What is max-duty-cycle
really encoding (I guess it has to do with the precision you're
expecting, but I'm not sure) ?
The PWM framework is using nanoseconds, the existing pwm-regulator
binding is using percents. Shouldn't we reuse one of them (I
guess you changed that because the percent unit was not precise
enough) ?

Best Regards,

Boris
