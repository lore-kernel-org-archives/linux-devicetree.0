As log could it be:
It seems there is not mali node in sun7i-a20.dtsi    << This is "Why"

Add mali node to sun7i-a20.dtsi                << This is "How"

Or can you point me to some example?
I've tried to check lot of other patches,
but really I can't understand which is the right way.

Right

Right

So I will delete "allwinner,sun8i-a23-mali",

Right,
but at this time OPPs are not ready,
so I can delete #cooling-cells = <2>;

So it's useless and I will remove that

Now, to avoid any possible other mistake,
do I have to resubmit patch corrected answering to this thread,
when you give me the ok?

PS. Sorry for the mess with double patches,
but I did a mess with mailing lists
and I'm new to this.

Thank you
