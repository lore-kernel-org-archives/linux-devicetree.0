As this is a serial GPIO controller, a critical piece of configuration
information is how many GPIOs we wish to serialise. This is done
in multiples of 8, up to 80 pins.

The bindings need to describe the "ngpios" property from the
generic GPIO bindings and how this affects the behaviour of
the controller.

We also need to add the "bus-frequency" property here to control
the rate of SGPMCK.

We need this, but not for the reason specified, and it should be a
required property. We need PCLK (the APB clock) to derive the SGPIO
bus frequency. Despite what the datasheet blurb says, there's no
debounce control for the SGPIO master (this is a copy/paste mistake
from the description of the parallel GPIO master).

You'll need to fix up the example after making the changes mentioned
above.
