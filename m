So I think you should have 2 ports (1 per channel) and then 2 endpoints 
for 1st (RGB/LVDS/ExtBridge and HDMI) and 1 endpoint (TV/VGA) for 2nd 
port.

So my concern is that no one else has needed this, so why do you? Based 
on the above, you know that a panel is always connected to port 0, 
endpoint 0. If it is an external bridge instead, then that can be 
determined when the bridge driver is bound.

They should, but allwinner,sun5i-a13-display-engine is not really an IP 
block. Again, what decides if you use the FE or not?
