I don't think you're wrong, and I'm an audio/i2s neophyte so I think
you're probably right and hopefully Mark can confirm that this is how
we want it.

One important thing to point out, which might be causing confusion, is
that this driver is claiming a clock which it internally calls "mclk"
but the way it's specified for rk3288 in the DT, that one is just the
one which drives the internal logic and has a gate.

This clock I'm adding is the actual mclk which is being driven to the
i2s slave device, and it has it's own gate and also has a mux, and we
need to claim both to be able to enable proper clock gating.
