Surely the requirement that the node must have <reg>,
<irqs> and <regulator> for the driver to even probe is a
binding?

The fact that the drivers/of/* core on Linux will auto-populate
platform devices with those properties is a pure Linux
pecularity, and the bindings are there for OS independence.

Whether we need to document it for such standard things
is another thing, hopefully Rob or someone can answer that?
