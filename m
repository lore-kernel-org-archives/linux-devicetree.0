Hi Sonny,

This looks generally fine, but there are a couple of minor changes below
that I would like to see (removing arm64/armv8 confusion, and describing
the problem more precisely).

Please drop the mention of arm64 here, and just say ARMv8 (they aren't
quite the same thing, and this confuses the matter). The differences
w.r.t. privilege boundaries and reset values are properties of ARMv8,
and would also apply to a 32-bit kernel.

Could we change this to:

- arm,cpu-registers-not-fw-configured: Firmware does not initialize any
  of the generic timer CPU registers, which contain their
  architecturally-defined reset values. Only supported for 32-bit
  systems which follow the ARMv7 architected reset values.

That should match your case precisely, and we can derive the reset
values of CNTVOFF and CNTHCTL from the architecture.

This would need fixing up similarly to "arm,cpu-registers-not-fw-configured".

With that:
