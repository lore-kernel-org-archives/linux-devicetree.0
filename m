I assure you that that is not the case or I would be banished from
lists by now. Outlook is generally incapable of correctly sending
mails to lists. The reply header above is one aspect of that. The
other problem is your replies don't get wrapped and prefixed properly.
That could be my client I guess, but *all* other mails are fine.

 multiple interfaces is well beyond the scope of what I am doing. I jus=

 I could consider it. Would you have "GPIO set" recommendations? Altern=

ACPI and DT are very different models in terms of abstraction and
governance. I'm not going to hash through all the details.

I'm not necessarily saying we have to have a single node, but that is
my default position. You have convince me that the functions are
completely independent and I cannot judge that if you are completely
ignoring the WiFi part. From Broadcom chips I've worked with, the
supplies at least are shared (something ACPI does not expose). Perhaps
we could fudge that and just require the same supply has to be
connected to each half. I still worry there could be other internal
inter-dependencies. Perhaps BT requires the SDIO clock to be active or
something like that. Maybe not on Broadcom chips, but on other vendors
and I have to care about them all.

Let's step back to what I'm asking for:

- A more specific compatible string. This should include the chip
name/number. You may not need it today, but it is insurance in case
you do find differences latter. The only impact is the match table in
your driver. You can also have a less specific compatible string if
you want that the driver can match on.

- Changing the location of the node. The node hierarchy implicitly
defines connections. You have a connection from the host UART to the
BT device. This needs to be described. Whether splitting BT and WiFi
nodes or not, I've already said it probably makes the most sense to
put this under the host uart node.

- Splitting the nodes. Here we are looking at doing either:

serial@1234 {
  compatible =3D "some-soc-uart";

  brcm43340 {
    compatible =3D "brcm,brcm43340";
    sdio-host =3D <&soc-sdhost>;
    // BT props
    // WiFi props
  };
};

Or:

serial@1234 {
  compatible =3D "some-soc-uart";

  brcm43340 {
    compatible =3D "brcm,brcm43340-bt";
    // BT props
  };
};

mmc@5678 {
  compatible =3D "some-soc-sdhci";

  brcm43340@0 {
    reg =3D <0>;
    compatible =3D "brcm,brcm43340-wifi";
    // WiFi props
  };
};

Or maybe it is the latter example but we just add phandle links
between the 2 nodes.

We haven't even considered what happens when a chip also has FM, NFC,
and/or GPS. Nor have we considered how to describe the audio
connection to the host processor, but we've got nothing common and
that can probably come latter.

We need to agree figuring all this out is needed. Otherwise, this
whole conversation is a waste of time.

Okay. Several people want to describe a connection between a host uart
and a device connected to the uart (BT, NFC, GPS, etc.). You are doing
this with your "tty" property. My goal and requirement is that this
connection be described in DT in the same way regardless of the device
attached. Just like all I2C device connections are described by being
child nodes under the I2C host regardless of the type of I2C device
attached.
