Hi,

I'm pretty sure that the patch was sent to the DT list devicetree@vger.kernel.org.
You had asked a question about "hi3798cv200-sysctrl" and I replied (https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/10/10/517).
I'm waiting for your new comments. If there's some misunderstatnding, please let me know.

Thanks,
Jiancheng
