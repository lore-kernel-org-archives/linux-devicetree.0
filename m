This patch serie adds support for TS-4800 board. This board,                                                                              
manufactured by Technologic Systems, is based on an IMX515.

The first stage bootloader, called TS-BOOTROM, enables the watchdog,
so a watchdog driver is required to prevent board from rebooting. It is
handled in a separate patchset.

The current device tree is minimal but it allows to get a shell on the
board.

Changes in v9:
 - Changed dts file license to X11/GPL
 - Reordered i2c2 node to be alphabetically sorted
 - Dropped container node in iomuxc

Changes in v8:
 - Split the serie into two parts, watchdog and dts, because there are
   no build dependencies between the two, and the syscon patch has been
   separately applied in Lee Jones' tree.
 - As a consequence, I dropped the patch which enabled the watchdog in
   imx_v6_v7_defconfig to ease the integration.

Changes in v7:
 - syscon: change bus-width DT property to reg-io-width
 - watchdog: add dependency on HAS_IOMEM (spotted by a 0-day build) 

Changes in v6:
 - vendor prefix: reorder to sort alphabetically (wrong order since v3)
 - split commit adding device tree into two patches: one for the doc, one for
   the bindings

Changes in v5:
 - watchdog: changed iteration stop condition in set_timeout to be less
   error prone

Changes in v4:
 - syscon: rewrite DT property reading to be clearer
 - watchdog: made fixes suggested by Guenter (now uses
   watchdog_init_timeout, u32 instead of u16, fixed error checking in
   probe, cleaned set_timeout)

Changes in v3:
 - Rebased on v4.3
 - Changed vendor prefix from "ts" to "technologic"
 - Added a DT option to generic syscon driver to allow regmap configuration
 - Dropped custom mfd driver, use generic syscon driver instead.

Changes in v2:
 - Added a mfd driver to handle syscon registers
 - The watchdog driver now uses the regmap (created by the mfd driver)
   to access the feed register
 - Remove watchdog's dependency on SOC_IMX51
