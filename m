This series updates/adds Device Tree support for I2SE's Duckbill
device family.

The Duckbill devices are small, pen-drive sized boards based on
NXP's i.MX28 SoC. While the initial variants (Duckbill series) were
equipped with a micro SD card slot only, the latest generation
(Duckbill 2 series) have an additional internal eMMC onboard.

Both device generations consists of four "family members":

- Duckbill/Duckbill 2: generic board, intended to be used as
  baseboard for custom designs and/or as development board

- Duckbill EnOcean/Duckbill 2 EnOcean: come with an EnOcean
  daugther board equipped with the popular TCM310 module

- Duckbill 485/Duckbill 2 485: as the name implies, these
  devices are intended to be used as Ethernet - RS485 converters

- Duckbill SPI/Duckbill 2 SPI: not sold separately, but used
  in I2SE's development kits for Green PHY HomePlug Powerline
  communication

Because the Duckbill series is EOL, this patch series only adds
support for the latest Duckbill 2 series devices. However,
support for the generic Duckbill board was already mainline,
so update it to match vendor tree DT.

Changes since v3:
- re-work compatible strings for individual products
- fixed subject prefix for documentation patch

Changes since v2:
- re-ordered documentation patch and fixed typos
- re-worded some commit messages to better reflect patch content
- fixed Makefile beginner issues
- added Acked-bys where applicable

Changes since v1:
- dropped device tree include (shared common definitions)
- added patch 9 (DT documentation file)
- applied reviewers hints
- rebased
