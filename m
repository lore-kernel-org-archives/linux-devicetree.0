I got it working by remove the 'static' from uart_base definition.

16 bytes corruption is a little beyond my guess.  I expect only 8
bytes corruption on omap3.  Can you please remove the 'static' in
uncompress.h to see if it helps?

Here is how I tracked it down with help from Dave Martin and Nicolas
Pitre.

http://lists.linaro.org/pipermail/linaro-kernel/2011-April/000259.html

With the comments given by Nicolas below, this seems a global issue in
platform uncompress.h.

--- quote begins ---
You must not use static variable in the decompressor.  For one thing, 
that breaks the ability to XIP the decompressor code and move writable 
data elsewhere.

So the fix is indeed to _not_ declare any global variable as static in 
this case.
--- quote ends ---

I would like to confirm it fixes your setup before I send fixing
patch to remove 'static' from global variables in all platform
uncompress.h.
