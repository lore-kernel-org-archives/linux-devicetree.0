The patch

   ASoC: add DT bindings documentation for ROHM BD28623 codec

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

+ROHM BD28623MUV Class D speaker amplifier for digital input
+
+This codec does not have any control buses such as I2C, it detect format and
+rate of I2S signal automatically. It has two signals that can be connected
+to GPIOs: reset and mute.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible      : should be "rohm,bd28623"
+- #sound-dai-cells: should be 0.
+- VCCA-supply     : regulator phandle for the VCCA supply
+- VCCP1-supply    : regulator phandle for the VCCP1 supply
+- VCCP2-supply    : regulator phandle for the VCCP2 supply
+
+Optional properties:
+- reset-gpios     : GPIO specifier for the active low reset line
+- mute-gpios      : GPIO specifier for the active low mute line
+
+Example:
+
+	codec {
+		compatible = "rohm,bd28623";
+		#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
+
+		VCCA-supply = <&vcc_reg>;
+		VCCP1-supply = <&vcc_reg>;
+		VCCP2-supply = <&vcc_reg>;
+		reset-gpios = <&gpio 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
+		mute-gpios = <&gpio 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
+	};
