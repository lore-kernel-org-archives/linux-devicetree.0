Just to align on the same page, I would like to define the terms used
above in context of SCMI:
1. commands : this is platform specific "command" to trigger/signal the
	      firmware that SCMI packet is sent. This is always platform
	      or controller specific and is not part of the
	      specification. It's just like doorbell but since MHU can
	      send 32-bit data, we need a way to specify the exact bit
	      as 32-bit data with just one bit set.

2. sub-commands : It is SCMI packet that includes the actual command
		defined in the SCMI specification. There are sent in
		SHMEM as Jassi mentioned above.
