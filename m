I finally managed to find the bug why mplayer did select-timeout on the GTA04.
Was a bug in pinmux setup of the GTA04 for the omap3isp.

And I have resurrected our years old 3.12 camera driver, which was based on the
MT9P031 code. It was already separate from ov9650/52.

I have extended it to support DT by including some parts of Hugues' work.

It still needs some cleanup and discussion but will be a simple patch (one
for ov9655.c + Kconfig + Makefile) and one for bindings (I hope it includes
all your comments).

I will post v1 in the next days.

BR,
Nikolaus
