I just received the 'applied' mail. But still want to confirm this topic to
see how to refine the driver in the step ahead.

Does that mean I should call set_bclk() once in the startup() when !active
to set a default bit clock rate to suit a common sample rate like 44100Hz?
I'm a bit confused if so. Because the driver would call set_bclk() any way
in the hw_params().

But your suggestion just reminds me of the slave mode in SSI driver as
default mode. And I should patch ESAI to slave mode for default as well,
shouldn't I?

Only shared in synchronous mode and totally individual in asynchronous mode.
Each of them can have their own HCK(MCLK) from different sources and derive
their own SCK(BCLK).

Thank you,
