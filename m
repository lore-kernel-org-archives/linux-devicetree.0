Whoops, I meant to clip these lines out of my original reply. Sorry for
the confusion below resulting from this.

The DT is separate from what the client driver might want, so if
different clients want different things, that should be requested in a a
generic and dnyamic fashion through the dmaengine API, with the physical
details left to the DMA controller driver.

I really don't see why the DTS author should be in charge of how the DMA
controller driver chooses to use interrupts in this fashion.

As above, I only meant to quote the interrupt bits here. The channel and
request line numbers should be in the DT as they are fixed HW details.

I'd have expected other DMA controllers to also need to handle this, but
from a quick skim of bindings I couldn't spot anything similar, so I
assume that this gets handled somehow dynamically.

Do you know what other DMA controllers do for cases like this in Linux?

Similarly this seems odd. What do other DMA controllers do?

I see that there is precedent with existing bindings.

Likewise there seems to be precedent for this. I don't know whether it
really makes sense for this to be in the DT.

I guess this is effectively an extension of the previous FIFO config
bits, so if those make sense I guess this does...

As with the other interrupts, I still don't believe this should be in
the DT.

Thanks,
Mark.
