Nothing can touch the registers again until the operation is complete. We can't even pass data back to the controller. We pass pointers to the M0 and it can write to the memory. The only data we sent back to the client is that status code from the polled register. When complete, data will already be written into the clients memory from the M0.

We have several clients for various drivers each with their own mbox channel. send_data in the controller could return EBUSY if the channel is being used by another channel (ie- transaction pending). If channel A sends a message, then client B sends one before A is complete, the controller's send_data must return an error. The message remains in the queue until tx_tick is called to re-submit it again. Client A polls the controller until complete then calls mbox_client_txdone. Client B can poll the controller but first needs a way of submitting the queued message again (via tx_tick->msg_submit). Using the ACK model I see no way client B can know when to start polling (ie- when client A's message was completed) or even kick off the msg_
 submit again. The submitting of messages from the queue to controller's send_data relies on knowing when sending a prior message on the channel was complete. It doesn't know when another
> channel's message has been sent. The only way I can see this working is using one channel shared among clients. We don't want to add any additional queuing of messages in the controller when the framework already does it (per channel). Hope this makes sense. Thanks.
Jassi, any further comment on this? We can leave the driver as is or agree on a way to remove the spinlock. Either works for me.

To give you an idea when we're using the mailbox driver: to reset, to unmask an aon gpio interrupt from the crmu interrupt handler (that was removed from the mailbox driver), to set aon gpio's as a wake source from the pinctrl gpio driver, and to read a persistent clock from the M0 on suspend.

Please let me know so we can proceed.
