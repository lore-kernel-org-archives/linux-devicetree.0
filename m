Hello,

The aim of this series is to minimise/eliminate all the warnings from the
ASPEED devicetrees. It mostly achieves its goal, as outlined below.

Using `aspeed_g5_defconfig` we started with the follow warning count:

    $ make dtbs 2>&1 >/dev/null | wc -l
    218

and after the full series is applied we have:

    $ make dtbs 2>&1 >/dev/null | wc -l
    2

for a 100x reduction.

Getting there though isn't without some potential controversy, which I've saved
for the last half of the series. The following patches I think are in pretty
good shape:

  ARM: dts: aspeed-g5: Move EDAC node to APB
  ARM: dts: aspeed-g5: Use recommended generic node name for SDMC
  ARM: dts: aspeed-g5: Fix aspeed,external-nodes description
  ARM: dts: vesnin: Add unit address for memory node
  ARM: dts: fp5280g2: Cleanup gpio-keys-polled properties
  ARM: dts: swift: Cleanup gpio-keys-polled properties
  ARM: dts: witherspoon: Cleanup gpio-keys-polled properties
  ARM: dts: aspeed: Cleanup lpc-ctrl and snoop regs
  ARM: dts: ibm-power9-dual: Add a unit address for OCC nodes

With these patches applied we get to:

    $ make dtbs 2>&1 >/dev/null | wc -l
    144

So they make a dent, but fail to clean up the bulk of the issues. From here
I've mixed in some binding and driver changes with subsequent updates to the
devicetrees:

  dt-bindings: pinctrl: aspeed: Add reg property as a hint
  dt-bindings: misc: Document reg for aspeed,p2a-ctrl nodes
  ARM: dts: aspeed: Add reg hints to syscon children
  dt-bindings: ipmi: aspeed: Introduce a v2 binding for KCS
  ipmi: kcs: Finish configuring ASPEED KCS device before enable
  ipmi: kcs: aspeed: Implement v2 bindings
  ARM: dts: aspeed-g5: Change KCS nodes to v2 binding
  ARM: dts: aspeed-g5: Sort LPC child nodes by unit address

By `dt-bindings: ipmi: aspeed: Introduce a v2 binding for KCS` the warnings are
reduced to:

    $ make dtbs 2>&1 >/dev/null | wc -l
    125

The bang-for-buck is in fixing up the KCS bindings which removes all-but-two of
the remaining warnings (which we can't feasibly remove), but doing so forces
code changes (which I'd avoided up until this point).

Reflecting broadly on the fixes, I think I've made a mistake way back by using
syscon/simple-mfds to expose the innards of the SCU and LPC controllers in the
devicetree. This series cleans up what's currently there, but I have half a
mind to rev the SCU and LPC bindings to not use simple-mfd and instead have a
driver implementation that uses `platform_device_register_full()` or similar to
deal with the mess.

Rob - I'm looking for your thoughts here and on the series, I've never felt
entirely comfortable with what I cooked up. Your advice would be appreciated.

Anyway, everyone, please let me know your thoughts on the bits relevant to you.
If we can agree on a way forward I'll split up the series for subsequent
submissions so it isn't such a spam-fest.

Cheers,

Andrew
