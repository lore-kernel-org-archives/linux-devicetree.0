Right, I've stopped being lazy and researched what the various properties
contain and documented them.

In the process I noticed that all other drivers have bank-width in bytes,
so I changed orion_nand to match. If using orion_nand without devicetree,
the width property is still in bits though. Hopefully this isn't considered too
bad? They have different names at least.

I've left out everything that has been merged into either Grant or Jason's
tree. Hopefully this was a useful thing to do.

Thanks again to everyone reviewing.

Changes since v3: Add support for DNS-320 and DNS-325 using devicetree
* Remove patches that are already merged
* Add documentation on orion_nand devicetree bindings
* Convert bank-width to be in bytes to match other properties
* Make defaults more explicit

Changes since v2: Add support for DNS-320 and DNS-325 using devicetree
* Split patches further, separating orion_nand and kirkwood changes
* dts renames: "bank-width", not "width". "okay", not "ok"
* Separate documentation out into separate patch, add references to
  partition.txt to all mtd bindings.
  
Changes since v1: Add support for DNS-320 and DNS-325 using devicetree
* Rebase against kirkwood_dt_for_3.4, removing premature devicetree ports.
* Move additions into a separate board-dnskw.c. It could be separated further
  into a board-dns320.c and board-dns325.c but it probably isn't worth it.
* s/marvell,/mrvl,/g
* Include an example dtb partition in documentation
* Copy structure of serial nodes to allow common options for NAND to be set
  in kirkwood.dtsi
* Simplifications in orion-nand.c
