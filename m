Multi-ITS systems are out there. The box I'm using for a large part of
my GICv4 testing has 8 of them. It is quite common to place ITSs close
to the PCIe RC, and multi-socket systems usually have at least one per
socket.

Hopefully the pre-ITS concept is a one-off nightmare, something we'll
laugh about in two years from now. Maybe.
