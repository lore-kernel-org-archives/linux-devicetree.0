I always make an analogy of HIDMA channel driver to a PCI endpoint device driver (8139too for example)
running on the guest machine.

Both HIDMA and PCI uses device pass-through approach.

I don't have an infrastructure for host and guest to communicate as I don't need to.
A HIDMA channel is assigned to a guest machine after an unbind from the host machine. 

Guest machine uses HIDMA channel driver to offload DMA operations. The guest machine owns the
HW registers for the channel. It doesn't need to trap to host for register read/writes etc.

All guest machine pages used are assumed to be pinned similar to VFIO PCI. 
The reason is performance. The IOMMU takes care of the address translation for me.

Sure, I'm ready to answer any questions. This is really a VFIO platform course. Not
a HIDMA driver course. The approach is not different if you assign a platfom 
SATA (AHCI) or SDHC driver to a guest machine.

The summary is that:
- IOMMU takes care of the mappings via VFIO driver.
- Guest machine owns the HW. No hypervisor interaction.

They don't.

Hypervisor has a bunch of channel resources. For each guest machine, the channel gets
unbound from the hypervisor. Channels get bind to each VFIO platform device and then
control is given to the guest machine.

Once the guest machine is shutdown, VFIO driver still owns the channel device. It can
assign the device to another guest machine.

No communication is needed.

No communication is needed.

Please let me know what exactly is not clear. 

You don't write a virtualization driver for 8139too driver. The driver works whether it is running in the 
guest machine or the hypervisor. 

The 8139too driver does not trap to the hypervisor for functionality when used in device
pass-through mode.

No difference here.
