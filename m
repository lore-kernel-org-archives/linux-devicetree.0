I think this is a bad idea, it means you can't try and re-use an
older kernel on an newer SoC design which may be broadly compatible
without changing the kernel source to add these flag checks.

I also don't like information hidden away that the user cannot see.
Having the device specifically named allows us to see from sysfs
exactly what we are dealing with.
