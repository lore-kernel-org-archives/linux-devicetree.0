Just making a start, I'll see if I can make it more useful.

I'll remove it.

Originally in of_twl6030_clk32kg_probe() clk_get() would be called and
that would only succeed after of_clk_init() got called in twl_probe().
Tero already pointed out that it should not be done that way.

The idea is to enable the clock by default to get the wifi working.
Sorry if I got it wrong.

Thanks for the hint I'll look at that driver for improvements.

Tero pointed that out already. Problem is that the clock doesn't show up
otherwise. An experimental patch from Tero might help, he offered to
post it.

Thanks for the comments Peter.
