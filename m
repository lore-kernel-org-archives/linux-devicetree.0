I'm not really sure this is the only case.

Most likely, you'd end up with that being called by every subsystem using DT
just in case.

And then each of those subsystems would need to call acpi_device_probe(), and
then another_platform_firmware_interface_device_probe() and so on.

Don't you see a problem here?

Thanks,
