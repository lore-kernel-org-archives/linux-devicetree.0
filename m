No, that is not what I want. Device drivers should ideally call interfaces
that just take a 'struct device' or 'struct platform_device' pointer,
and those should be implemented in an appropriate way.

I must still be missing part of what you are trying to achieve above.
We definitely need an interface to get properties from the device itself,
like

int device_get_property(struct device *dev, const char *propname, void **valptr);

(whatever valptr ends up being, that would be a separate discussion).

As soon as it comes to devices that have child nodes, I don't see a
necessity to have a generic abstraction for them, as this is typically
only done for some of the more obscure bindings, or for child nodes that
are defined in a subsystem-wide binding rather than a device private
binding.

For the former case, I think they are indeed better left in drivers that
actively know the difference between DT and ACPI, and that don't necessarily
use the same binding for both. In the latter case, I'd leave the
implementation up to subsystem code, which again would know what
interface it is using.
