Its was suggested that parts of dtbindings and of_* wrapper merged into 
this patch.  In V5 review comments. https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/4/28/175

Makes sense, will do that in next version.

Yes, we need this to match the compatible string from device tree vs 
driver itself, most of the bus driver do this in bus match functions.

Two cases to consider here,
1> If the device is up and discoverable.
2> Device is not discoverable yet, as it needs some power up sequence.


In first case comparing with ID table makes sense.

But second case we would want to probe the device(for power sequencing) 
before we can discover the device on bus.


This code as it is supports both DT and id_table.

up would be called when a device is discovered on the bus, and down on 
when the device disappeared on slimbus.

It is scheduling a device_up() callback in workqueue for reporting 
discovered device.

This is made inline with __platfrom_driver_register() suggested in v5 
review.

I partly agree with you, as all the devices on slimbus might not be in a 
discoverable state. Such devices would need some sort of power up 
sequence which what the of_wrapper and the match function are trying to 
achieve. Driver probe will be called based on the compatible match which 
would then power up/reset the device so that it can announce itself and 
the device_up() would be called at that point.

Your comment is 100% true, If the devices are in discoverable state, in 
such case we would not need any DT entires as you said.

I think these are the controller ids, just to create a proper name space
