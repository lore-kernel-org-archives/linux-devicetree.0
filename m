Nice! :)

OK, I can see that being a price worth paying. Though it's possible to
include the binding at least for that in this series I'd be even
happier. Actually I see we already have

  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/ingenic,jz47xx-pwm.txt

in mainline - what needs to change with it?

Should this be "ilitek,ili8960"?

Is there a binding & driver for this submitted somewhere? If not then do
we need this at all? It doesn't look like the existing platform data
would actually lead to a driver being loaded so I'm wondering if we can
just drop this until such a driver (or at least a documented DT binding)
exists.

Thanks,
    Paul
