That's fine. Just wanted to let you know about _relaxed() since it will
benefit your platform.

That is pretty nifty, could you explain (or reference me to a arch doc
that does) the exact semantics of that "idly4" instruction?

Correct. The various *_lock() functions only need imply an ACQUIRE
barrier, such that the critical section happens after the lock is taken.

Indeed so, the various *_unlock() functions only need imply a RELEASE
barrier, such that the critical section happend before the lock is
released.

In both cases (lock and unlock) there is a great amount of subtle
details, but most of that is irrelevant if all you have is smp_mb().

Even on 2 cores I think you can create starvation cases with
test-and-set spinlocks. And the maintenace overhead of carrying two lock
implementations is non trivial.

As to performance; I cannot say, but the ticket lock isn't very
expensive, you could benchmark of course.
