This is really a simplification.  If we only had to consider the path
from devices to memory, and if the pretence that the memory is at /
works (almost always true, at least for general-purpose memory), then
we often have a simpler problem.  It is still not always solvable
though, since a device could still have a unique access path with
unique mappings that cannot be described in terms of any of the other
paths.

However, this is not just about DMA any more.  Devices also master onto
interrupt controllers to generate MSIs, onto IOMMUs to provide them
with address space remapping, onto other devices via IOMMUs; and GPUs
can master onto all kinds of things.

The alternative to a completely generic description of bus mastering
would be to consider the specific things that we are interested in
allowing devices to master on, and describe the whole end-to-end
link for each in the bus master's node.

 * memory
 * interrupt controllers (for MSIs)
 * IOMMUs

This could lead to combinatorial blow-up as the number of target
devices grows, since these linkages have to be re-described for
every bus master -- especially for GPUs which could do a fair amount of
device control by themselves.  It could also lead to fragmentation
as each binding solves common problems in different ways.

The downside is that is any path flows through a dynamically
configurable component, such as an IOMMU or a bridge that can be
remapped, turned off etc., then unless we describe how the path is
really linked together the kernel will need all sorts of baked-in
knowledge in order to manage the system safely.  The _effect_ of the
problem component on the path is not static, so we can't describe 
that effect directly in the DT.  For truly weird features that are
unique to a particular platform that's OK, but "how devices are
linked together" seems a much more general and useful concept than that.

I may have missed your point slightly before.  Anyway, I think the
"multiple master roles" issue is sufficiently unusual that describing 
them using multiple device nodes in the DT is reasonable.  So I think
I'm happy to get rid of the ability to specify and distinguish multiple
roles within a single device node.
