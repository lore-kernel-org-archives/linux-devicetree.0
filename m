I intended to make it be the total latency from whatever sources that
should be counted on particular system.  Rather than adding complexity
for the driver to figure out these latencies from every single source,
I would expect that people know the possible maximum latency in total
for their systems and specify it in device tree.

Ok, makes sense to me.

Are you asking for a change on regulator_set_voltage API?  While I agree
with your comment, it's not a thing we need to necessarily do in this
series.  The change on the API requires a touch on all the existing
users.  I do not think it's nice to carry such a patch in this series.

I do not understand it.  The regulator is optional for the driver, and
we can still scale frequency even if there is no regulator.
