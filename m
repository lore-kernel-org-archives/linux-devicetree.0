Fixed locally, will be part of next version.

Yes. But the reason I have added an explicit method is considering other
possible future methods. E.g. SMC is being discussed as one possible
method. And if the function ids become part of some specification, then
only method is sufficient in that case.

Anyways I can drop them if you think it's unnecessary.

Ah, sorry for that. Fixed locally as "arm,scmi-shmem" everywhere now and
dropped all juno specific compatibles. I will have a juno specifc
document when it will get used on Juno platform.
