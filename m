My patch does add BUCK1A and BUCK1B, please refer to the PATCH[4/5] of
earlier series, which is accepted.

Probably that is the only way to handle this.

how about,

As you mentioned, pm800_regulator_info[] is not constant, so I can 
update the constraint before regulator_register() and also do not
register BUCK1B, if dual phase is enabled.

So in summary,

if (dual phase is enabled)
{
	Update constraint of BUCK1 to 6A
	and do not register BUCK1B
} else {
	register both BUCK1A and BUCK1B with default constraint of 3A.
}

Thanks,
