Poslab Savageboard is i.MX6 SoC base, but BSP code from the vendor is 
not mainline u-boot and kernel. Personal reason of using this board is 
testing etnaviv user-space driver, so I re-write device tree files based on
mainline kernel for the first step.

This patchset includes common DT file, dual and quad board files.

Supported components are
  - Display: HDMI and LVDS panel
  - eMMC and SD card
  - Ethernet
  - Pinmux configuration
  - SATA: only for Savageboard quad
  - UART1 for debug console
  - USB host

Missing features are
  - Audio (WM8903)
  - USB OTG
  - PMIC WM8326: default settings are used so no issue to bring-up the system
  - MIPI DSI, CSI

Patches are tested on the Savageboard quad but the dual version should work 
because the only difference between dual and quad is SATA support.

More information in http://www.savageboard.org

v3:
  Specify the dtbs for i.MX6 build.

v2:
  Fix DT node for regulator, phy-reset-gpios and iomuxc node.
