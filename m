For eMMC, vmmc and vqmmc correspond to the pins on the eMMC chip.
vmmc provides power to the internals, while vqmmc provides power to the
I/O buffers on both sides. With SD this is a bit less clear. IIUC the SD
card itself supplies I/O voltage, dropping it to 1.8V if necessary, from
VDD (vmmc). vqmmc only affects the host side, and whatever external pull-ups
that might exist.

For the WiFi chip, there is a separate IO-VCC rail, which is VCC-IO-WIFI.
This, from what I understand of the datasheet, is for I/O signaling, and
thus vqmmc. VCC-WIFI is what powers the chip, which is what vmmc is.

A33 datasheet has a "VCC-USB" power pin, which it says is "Power supply
for the USB PHY". This should probably be tied to the USB PHY node. The
PHY framework has a common "phy-supply" property, though I don't know if
it works with sunxi's multiple PHY per node approach.
