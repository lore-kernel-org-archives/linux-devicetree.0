Nope, the solution you proposed already exists upstream so changing it is not
convienient, it is IMO the correct thing to do and the current upstream solution
is the hack.

Allowing the common CCF to disable this clock during clk_disable_unused is
wrong, and can lead to catastrophic failure which requires a reboot.

IMO Linux needs to be resilient to whatever state the hardware could be left in
by previous software. It can't assume it will be OK to disable this clock, we
*know* there is a HW bug, we *know* that disabling the clock can brick the
board.

So I stick with my initial assertion, if this clock is enabled when Linux is
booted it *should not* be disabled.

This is a odd thing to say. I'm not aware of any other clocks which
will render the platform unusable that aren't already listed as critical for the
STi platform.

But the Linux kernel isn't just used by us. It is not uncommon for STB
bootloaders to get information from the frontend as part of the boot process.

I have, it leads to the same behaviour as turning off any of the other critical
clocks, the SoC is dead and the board needs to be rebooted.

This clock also should never be turned off by Linux..ever. It is unsafe to do so.

Incidentally this isn't the only platform upstream where the requirement for a
clocks criticalness is dependent on whether it was enabled during boot. Take a
look in bcm/clk-bcm2835.c

                /* If the clock wasn't actually enabled at boot, it's not
                 * critical.
                 */
                if (!(cprman_read(cprman, data->ctl_reg) & CM_ENABLE))
                        init.flags &= ~CLK_IS_CRITICAL;

What is your recollection of their views? LIke I said before this should be

STi platform clocks are mainly described in DT in stih407/10-clock.dsti, which is SoC
specific, and binds with code in drivers/clk/st. So the marking of a clock as
critical is done on a SoC basis which is what I want.

A quick grep of CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED or CLK_IS_CRITICAL, will show you where the
equivalent code for other platforms is located.

I don't understand what you mean here. The point of using CCF and the critical
flag is so the reference counting of the clock is held at 1.

You have hardware for Merged Input Blocks, SWTS, TSDMA, Cable Card Stream
Convertor and Tag Counter which is currently unsupported upstream.

I don't understand why if you had a choice you would choose to put the logic
there over the clock subsystem.

The reasoning is the same as with the I2C & SPI drivers. You don't want to have
to put a platform specific clocking knowledge into each driver, when it
could live centrally in the clock subsystem for the platform. You also don't want to
have to change the driver when a different SoC with the same IP has a different
clock tree.

Not only that CCF *has* to have the knowledge internal to the clock susbsytem so
that it doesn't disable the clock during the clk_disable_unused phase on boot.

I don't think there is anything special about it. If when Linux
boots the clock is enabled you shouldn't disable it, just like the other
critical clocks.
