I'm not sure if everyone would like this, but the following trick
works. If we configure the PD2 pin as input with pull-down on the SoC
side and read it, then it still reads as 1 on pcDuino2. Which means
that the pull-up is apparently stronger (by how much and whether this
is really reliable is another question). It should read as 0 on
pcDuino1 and we might use this to detect the board type at runtime.

Still it is probably an overkill for just this really minor thing :-)
