I thought the standard clock binding provided a way to set this flag. Now I
crosschecked the binding, it doesn't ...

My point was I didn't want the flag to be settable from 2 different places,
where consistency was to be kept across different device-tree leafs.

All right, I'm convinced now I undertand the flag was not settable from
devicetree binding before this patchset.

You can add to patch 3/4 :
