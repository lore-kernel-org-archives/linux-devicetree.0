Ok :)

Understood, I recall that thread but didn't have the hardware back then.

Right, I also make use of that kernel, of course. It's just too old
to make me completely happy.

Excellent, so I feel like you ultimately giving me mixed messages here.
You said you need to take care of this licensing issue and I think you
implied you'd take care of the audio and rtc stuff as you have that
patch in your backlog. However, sounds like you've given up on pushing
the bigger things upstream given the problem with getting agreement
on those pieces. Are you just going to be submitting the
less controversial portions like the audio and dts updates? My goal for
HB initially is just to have all the low-hanging fruit (like rtc and audio)
working on mainline...besides the stuff that's already there.

Hrm, I also don't care about WiFi/BT on this board, I also prefer wired,
but on a custom board I'll have to support a different WiFi/BT vendor so
I'll take a look at that reset solution you are carrying.

Thanks,
Matt
