We are changing how shared interrupts are described in DT. We don't
need 2 ways to describe them. We could say this is only for AT91 and
continue to describe shared interrupts as has been done forever. Then
the next platform that hits this problem will have to go thru the same
ABI breakage. Or we change DT practices to describe all shared
interrupts with a demux node. Given the way DTs are incrementally
created, it is not something we can check with review or tools, so we
will still have the same ABI breakage problem.

What's the solution for a platform that an ABI break is not okay and
can't deal with the fallout?

Someone has to. It is a problem that we need to get better at
preventing. It's an ABI. I don't think I need to explain what that
means.

Certainly there are folks who would just prefer DT to be a kernel data
structure so we don't have to worry about this ABI nonsense.
