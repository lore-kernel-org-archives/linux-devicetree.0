FKAN: our system block in your reference would be the system clock unit (SCU).
It handles number of things (JTAG, clock control, power control not
touched by OS).
The register that is relevant to the system reset is this lone
register. I reduce the
range of the dts aperture due to this fact.

FKAN: I could remove this dts node and create another dts node that
describe the range of registers on the SCU and use that node in this driver.
I am not sure which subsystem I can use to handle this case, I do see a reset
subsystem in the kernel but more used for ip resets. Please kindly let
me know. Thanks for the great feedback.
