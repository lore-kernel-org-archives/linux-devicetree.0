Perhaps this would even have been enough. It looks to me that we've
created much better, more rigorous processes as a side-effect. I can
easily imagine that if we had done all of that but without moving to DT,
the end result may have been equally good.

I'm not saying that DT is bad. There are a whole lot of good things
about it that I really like. On the other hand, I've recently realized
that it has become increasingly difficult to upstream even the most
trivial functionality because now everybody wants to design the perfect
DT binding with the effect of new features not going anywhere.

But I digress, and I should probably start a separate discussion about
that.

I have some difficulty understanding what you think should've been moved
out of the kernel. There's only so much you can put into data structures
and at some point you need to start writing device specific code for the
peripherals that you want to drive.

If I recall correctly, the original OpenFirmware that introduced the DT
concept used to have something similar to UEFI/ACPI. Essentially it was
possible to not only pass the DT to the operating system but also allow
the operating system to call back into the firmware to request service.

Of course this brings up the issue about the degree to which we want to
rely on the firmware to do the right thing. If it's difficult to update
firmware (which it usually is), then we'll likely end up reimplementing
some of the functionality in the kernel because firmware might end up
being buggy and therefore we can't trust it.

On the other hand, one thing that I very much like about the concept is
that DT isn't only used as a way to describe the hardware but also uses
the notion of services provided by nodes. That means that a DT binding
not only defines the properties that characterize hardware but also a
set of operations that can be performed on a compatible node. This does
not only apply on a per-compatible basis but also depending on device
type. A PCI device for instance provides standard services to read the
configuration space.

Most of this applies to Linux already because when a device referred to
by phandle is used by some other device, the phandle needs to be
resolved to some Linux-specific object (regulator, clock, backlight...)
before it can be used and the given subsystem already defines all the
operations that can be performed. So perhaps this isn't really all that
relevant after all...

That sounds very much like a sledgehammer solution. Also I'm not sure if
it would solve all that many problems. I guess what it could solve is to
move a whole lot of the underlying specifics of the various SoCs to some
other place (the host). It's fundamentally very similar to ACPI, and it
comes with the same set of advantages and disadvantages.

What will likely happen with such a solution is that we'll have to come
up with a standard interface that the guest OS expects. Once that has
been defined, vendors will have to implement that interface. Naturally
most of them will choose Linux as a host OS. What we'll end up with is
unlikely to be any better than the current situation.

Vendor kernels that implement the host OS will effectively become forks
of their own since there's no incentive to upstream code anymore. Linux
upstream becomes a single unified architecture because all interfaces
are now the same. Vendors are back to brewing their own. Except for the
rare occasions where something needs to be added to the guest interface
there won't be much interaction between kernel developers. We will also
need to specify stable interfaces between host and guest and I think
everyone involved with DT lately has some experience as to how painful
that can be. So instead of being able to add new features to the kernel
within a single release cycle, we'll likely end up having to wait for a
few cycles because it needs to be implemented in both guest and host,
which may or may not have the same release cycles.

The above is the worst case scenario, but the alternative would be that
Linux is still forked into host and guest, yet vendors keep working on
one upstream host Linux. In that case, we're not solving anything. All
the same problems that we have now will remain. Well, we might be able
to make it somewhat easier for distributions, but there are a whole lot
of disadvantages to it as well.
