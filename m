Right. Another thing is that the property handling code (active low
only for now) is duplicated again, but that can be addressed
separately.

I will have a look at gpio-leds and gpio_keys_polled to see if we
cannot make this work at a higher level. It's easier to have the
bindings respected if the code itself enforces them.
