This is the updated version of my RFC patch from [0].

The quick summary for this patch is that the "cpu_clk" seems to have
been copied from the Meson8b clock driver when the GXBB clock driver
was initially added. However, on GXBB (and the other GX SoCs) the
actual CPU clock is provided by a SCPI DVFS clock.
More details can be found in the patch description itself.

This was tested on a Khadas VIM board (GXL S905X).


Changes since the RFC version:
- rebased to the "clk-meson" branch (e65ae3fb97b4 "dt-bindings: clock:
  gxbb-clkc: Add GXL compatible variant") and Jerome's audio clock
  patches (in version 2: [1])
- remove the now unused cpu_div_table (which was left over in the RFC
  version)
- slightly updated the comment for the now unused clock ID 1 in
  drivers/clk/meson/gxbb.h
