If there is no penalty for setting maxburst to 1 (or 2 in the case of
dual fifo I think), then should we just set both the watermark and
maxburst to 1?

I guess the real difference would be when you're in FIQ mode.  In FIQ
mode, the penalty of an interrupt per word would be pretty bad, but in
DMA mode, if we just set both to 1, we should be fine, right?
