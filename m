I already responded to this, but never got any response.  I
was preparing to re-send this series and wanted to try to
pull the added feature (patch 1) out and not be dependent on
it.  But I think it's a bit ugly so I'm hoping to get a
blessing to proceed with what I originally proposed.  For
reference, here's the thread:
    https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/4/3/421

What I'm trying to do is get the value of a "secondary-boot-reg"
property from a node known to have an "enable-method" property
that matches the method name supplied in CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE().

Using the callback function as I originally proposed, this is
very easy.  When arm_dt_init_cpu_maps() parses the "cpus" portion
of the device tree it calls set_smp_ops_by_method() for a
matching "cpu" or "cpus" node, and that function supplies
the node to the callback function. The callback can extract
additional property values if needed.

If I hold off until smp_prepare_cpus() is called, I have to
re-parse the device tree to find the "cpus" node (this is
in itself trivial).  I then need to re-parse that node to
verify the matching "enable-method" property is found before
looking for the parameter information I need for that enable
method.  I would really prefer not to re-do this parsing
step.  It's imprecise and a little inefficient, and it
duplicates (but not exactly) logic that's already performed
by arm_dt_init_cpu_maps().

One more point of clarification.  This "secondary-boot-reg"
value is *not* the secondary boot address--that is, it's
not the address secondary cores jump to when they are
activated.  Instead, this is the address of a register
that's used to request the ROM code release a core from
its ROM-implemented holding pen.  For this machine,
control jumps at that point to secondary_startup(),
defined in arch/arm/kernel/head.S.

So...

Stephen, I'd like to hear from you whether my explanation
is adequate, and whether you think my addition and use of
CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE_SETUP() is reasonable.  (If you have
a suggestion for a better name, I'm open.)

If you still don't like it, I'll follow up with a
new version of the patches, this time parsing the
device tree in the smp_prepare_cpus() method as
you suggested.  I don't want this to hold up getting
this SMP support into the kernel.

Thanks.
