I've been working with David's v7 patch series for a bit of time now
and things have been working well.  v8 looks good.  Feel free to add:

Tested-by: Douglas Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>

...to this patch.  Speaking of which it might be getting very close to
time for this series to land along with David's other series, AKA:

* [1/2] regulator: of: add property for allowed modes specification
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10395731/

* [2/2] regulator: of: add support for allowed modes configuration
  https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10395725/


Specifically I think we are mostly waiting for RPMh to land.  This is
on Andy's plate right now but I think it's happy and just waiting for
the actual push from Andy.


NOTE: I don't know if there anything special we need to do for landing
this and RPMh across two git repositories.  Offline Stephen Boyd
mentioned to me that maybe it was fine to land this in Mark's tree
without the RPMh code since it depends on "QCOM_RPMH", but the "||
COMPILE_TEST" worries me and makes me think auto-builders will start
yelling.  Andy and Mark: what do you think?


If it's helpful to have a link to the latest RPMh, here are patchwork
IDs on linux-arm-msm:

10477501 [v13,01/10] drivers: qcom: rpmh-rsc: add RPMH controller for QCOM SoCs
10477559 [v13,02/10] dt-bindings: introduce RPMH RSC bindings for Qualcomm SoCs
10477545 [v13,03/10] drivers: qcom: rpmh-rsc: log RPMH requests in FTRACE
10477543 [v13,04/10] drivers: qcom: rpmh: add RPMH helper functions
