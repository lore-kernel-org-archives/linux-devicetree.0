Thank you. I'm checking the ALSA drivers of other companies, I found Qualcomm's
QTi LPASS driver is similar with my wanted.

I read Intel's driver, I understand how to define the compress CPU DAI and
snd_compr_ops. The driver of Intel Atom (at sst-mfld-platform-pcm.c) defines
following DAI:
{
	.name = "compress-cpu-dai",
	.compress_new = snd_soc_new_compress,
	.ops = &sst_compr_dai_ops,
	.playback = {
		.stream_name = "Compress Playback",
		.channels_min = 1,
	},
},

But I can't find how to use/map this DAI in machine driver or Device-Tree or
something. I think that it's same as PCM DAI, am I correct?

I read compress-offload.rst, but I can't find how do I test it. It seems aplay
of
alsa-util doesn't know compress audio formats. Should I use PulseAudio or
Android HAL to test compress audio APIs?
