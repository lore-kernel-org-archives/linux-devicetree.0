It's not that I don't get it. I'm just arguing against it.

IMHO, it's wrong to create a parallel universe for v7M multiplatform...

Multiplatform as I understand it is mainly about selecting multiple SoC
_platforms_ but not necessarily multiple CPU platforms. It happens to
work well for V6/V7, but does not for others, and preventing
multiselection for incompatible CPU platforms is the way to prevent
creating such images.

Ok, I don't have such a strong feel for multiplatform, it just feels a
bit better to me. I need a top level ARCH which is able to live with
!MMU. Will try the ARCH_SINGLE_ARMV7M approach then.
