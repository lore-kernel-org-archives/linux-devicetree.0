Your proposal requires extra work from a couple different maintainers to
track all the dependencies, and is very error prone.  Sometimes
maintainers may do this for you if they have time and are feeling
generous, but you will have much more success if you can ease the
process.

Jerome has provided lots of guidance throughout this series and just
above has provided you with a very good proposal above which minimizes
the dependencies, and provides the changes in the right order.

Please follow Jerome's suggestion,

Thanks,

Kevin
