It usually depends on how complex the conflict is and whether your
patches functionally depend on the other patches. I have no idea what
the dependency is here since I haven't tried applying them to mainline.

If there are fixes to the arm64 ACPI NUMA patches that Rafael queued
into linux-next, they should be sent to him and potentially being queued
on top ahead of the 4.8 merging window or shortly after 4.8-rc1.
Non-ACPI NUMA patches (as I can see, most of these patches are DT
specific) could be merged independently.

So how many patches do you have in each category below:

1. NUMA fixes against current mainline (4.7-rc3)
2. NUMA fixes against the arm64 ACPI NUMA patches queued by Rafael
3. New functionality or clean-up. Are these against mainline or ACPI
   NUMA patches?
