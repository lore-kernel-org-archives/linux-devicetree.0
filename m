/I/ don't want to specify virtual groups at all:-)

It's up to individual pinctrl drivers what groups they define. Equally,
it's up to the drivers whether they define their list of groups as static
data within the driver, or as nodes/properties in the device tree.

Nothing that I put into my binding proposal is in any way related to what
I call virtual groups; the "pin configuration nodes" are simply a listing
of mux or config values for whatever pins or groups the pinctrl driver
happens to expose, whether they're real HW pins/groups or not, and whether
the list they expose came from a static table or not.

I don't quite follow that, but I think it's important to allow drivers
flexibility to store their list of pins/groups/functions wherever they
want; mandating that the lists be stored in device tree won't please
everyone.

That's easily handled in the binding I proposed; simply don't put any
mux/config settings into the device tree. Portable drives will still
call pinmux_get(), so there need to be nodes to back that up, but the
list of strings that get applied can be empty if you wish, assuming the
driver doesn't need different configurations at runtime.

Similar answer to (1).

> 3. Dynamic remuxing of pins for the pins specified in the .dts files

Yes, that's handled by simply putting multiple named configurations into
the device tree.

No.

The same TEGRA_PMX_CONF_* parameter doesn't necessarily exist for all
pins or all groups.

Where it does exist, different pins/groups may store the value in a
different bit number in the/some register based on the group, and the
width of the bit field may vary too.

So, the TEGRA_PMX_CONF_* are just a logical name/ID of the parameter to be
configured, which is then looked up in the table of pins/groups known to
the Tegra pinctrl driver, which also determines the register, bit, and
field size for the combination.
