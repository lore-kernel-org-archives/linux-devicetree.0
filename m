No, we don't in the current design. This is only a single process 
acting as a proxy and dispatching commands on dbus to other
processes doing whatever they need to do. So the request/responses 
can interlace. 

The current daemon already handles an expiry list but I thought it 
would be better to move it in the kernel to have a better response
time. The BMC can be quite slow when busy. It seems that keeping
the logic in user space is better. So let's have it that way. Not
a problem.

No it is ok. I will give your fix a try on our system and resend.

Thanks,
