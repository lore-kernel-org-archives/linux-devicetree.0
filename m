Ugh, that is annoying. I would think that having code compile properly
would trump the desire to have all of the documentation merged as one
patch.

On the other hand, I've been asked to not take binding descriptions
through the clk tree. That is a policy that I'm happy to comply with,
but it is at odds with the recommendation for the header and the binding
description to be merged together.

DT folks, what is the right way to do this? An immutable, shared branch
just for a single header file solves the problem, but also feels very
cumbersome for such a trivial issue.

How about allowing binding descriptions to be merged without the header
file, so long as it is merged through another tree?

Regards,
Mike
