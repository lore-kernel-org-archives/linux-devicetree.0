late_initcall() is too late for genpd to be initialized. As you may have
seen with the latest set of patches, we have problems with timer
initialization. After converting to platform devices, PSC and PLL clocks
get initialized post time_init(). We are working that around using
fixed-clocks, which hopefully will work (I still need to test many of
the affected platforms).

Can you please reply with the exact issue you faced with genpd framework
initialization so we do have that on record.

Thanks,
Sekhar
