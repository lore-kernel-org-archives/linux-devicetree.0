That removes the need to define a single group for each pin that
can be used as GPIO.

It is described in Documentation/pinctrl.txt under the heading
"Pin control interaction with the GPIO subsystem"

On a related key I guess drivers/gpio/gpio-msm-v2.c needs
to be patched to call pinctrl_request_gpio()/
pinctrl_free_gpio()/pinctrl_gpio_direction_input()/
pinctrl_gpio_direction_output() before the GPIO back-end
works at all so there is still time to change this (plus it is
not part of the DT binding or anything so it can be changed
at any time).

Yours,
