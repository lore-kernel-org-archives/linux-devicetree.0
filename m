This wasn't really my idea, so I can't take all the credit for it. =3D)

I don't think ARM mandating this is necessary. In the end it boils down
to faster time to market, doesn't it? I mean if you have a device that
exposes a standard set of registers and a driver for that standard set
already exists, then it's very little work to get the device working
with it. You also save a lot of work on validation.

The 16550 UART register set wasn't mandated by anyone as far as I know,
but still the majority of UART devices implement it. I guess the same is
true of EHCI or SDHCI.

Some aspects could possibly be solved by making them parts of a bus
specification I guess. If bus specifications made some provisions for
controlling the power, reset, clocking and other aspects of the IP on
that bus, that would make quite a few things easier. That isn't a new
idea of course, it's been done in other systems, such as PCI, before.

Yes, that's true. The Linux 8250 driver, while generally dealing with
the same register set, still requires an awful amount of code and data
tables to make it work on the myriad of devices out there. And the set
of registers is pretty small compared to other types of hardware.

I guess in the end it boils down to a redistribution of the workload.
While I think we're doing a pretty good job with adding hardware support
in the Linux kernel, we're still struggling to keep up with new hardware
being continually added. One solution to that problem is to keep adding
massive amounts of software engineers to keep up with the changes in
hardware. Typically this has the side-effect of making the delta between
upstream and downstream kernels larger, unfortunately.

Another solution, the one discussed here, is to move more complexity
into hardware, therefore reducing the workload of software engineers by
making the job of hardware engineers harder.
