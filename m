To circle back to the original point: the problem is that (IMHO) the
hardware is doing the wrong thing by still counting Linux's vote for a
voltage even though Linux also voted that the regulator should be
disabled.  So basically we're working around the hardware by
pretending to vote for a dummy lower voltage whenever Linux wants the
regulator disabled.  From Linux's point of view everything works as
normal--we just tell the hardware a falsehood so it doesn't count our
vote for a voltage while the regulator is disabled.
