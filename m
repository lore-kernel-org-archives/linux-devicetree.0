The first one is used to build the board file for all DT based machines,
the second one is used to select the dts file. I would be enough to have just
the first one, but that makes it harder to find for people looking for
dreamplug.

Maybe change the text to "Generic Marvell Kirkwood DT based (e.g. DreamPlug)"?

Putting this into the dtb would require converting kirkwood to use the
pinctrl subsystem first, if we want to have proper bindings. When I
did the hands-on review of the code with Jason during ELC, we decided
to leave this being done the legacy way for now, which also matches
how Tegra does it until we have the pinctrl bindings.

Also note how the patch description says "Driver porting will start
with the uart (see next patch), and progress from there.  Possibly,
spi/flash/partitions will be next." I think this is the best approach
indeed and I'd probably leave the pinctrl stuff until the end.

It's wrong, and the condition is negated. It should be

	if (of_machine_is_compatible("marvell,dreamplug"))
		dreamplug_init();

The idea is that there is one init function for all dt based
kirkwood machines, which contains special setup functions for
those boards that don't (yet) describe all the hardware in the
dt.

Since you mention the name, it should probably be "globalscale,dreamplug"
because the device is made by GlobalScale instead of Marvell.
