The event router via of_dma_router_register() should be capable of =

handling different type of muxers, like the ti-dma-crossbar.c is doing =

for two different type of event crossbars.

Basically with the of_dma_route_allocate you craft a dma_spec which can =

be understood by the dma-master pointed form the router's node.
You do the configuration of the mux in this function, craft the dma_spec =

and that's it. In DT the peripherals are using the router's node for DMA =

binding and everything is transparent for them.

Note: The use of am335x xbar in the ti-dma-crossbar is optional and only =

needed when we need to have different event than the default for a =

specific dma request line.

If you normally use the DMA like this:
dmas =3D <&edma 129 1>, <&ddma_xbar 128 1>;
dma-names =3D "tx", "rx";

If you have DMA event router/mux, then depending on how it works you =

might have different number of parameters. In my case the DRA7 crossbar =

does not need extra parameter, so to get it in use:
dmas =3D <&edma_xbar 129 1>, <&edma_xbar 128 1>;
dma-names =3D "tx", "rx";

The router driver will rewrite the dma_spec and replace the 129/128 and =

pass something different to the dma-master (dynamic event mapping).

On am335x we have different xbar type so there:

dmas =3D <&edma_xbar 12 0 1>, <&edma_xbar 13 0 2>;

Out from this the router driver will create a spec equivalent to
dmas =3D <&edma_xbar 12 0>, <&edma_xbar 13 0>;

But it will change the xbar that DMA request 12/13 will not have the =

default event routed to.

I believe that the dma_router infra we have in dmaengine can cover most =

if not all use cases...
