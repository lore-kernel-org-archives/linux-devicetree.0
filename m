Lochnagar is an evaluation and development board for Cirrus
Logic Smart CODEC and Amp devices. It allows the connection of
most Cirrus Logic devices on mini-cards, as well as allowing
connection of various application processor systems to provide a
full evaluation platform. This driver supports the board
controller chip on the Lochnagar board.

Changes since v1:
 - Made clock name a bit more generic

Thanks,
Charles

+Cirrus Logic Lochnagar Audio Development Board
+
+Lochnagar is an evaluation and development board for Cirrus Logic
+Smart CODEC and Amp devices. It allows the connection of most Cirrus
+Logic devices on mini-cards, as well as allowing connection of
+various application processor systems to provide a full evaluation
+platform.  Audio system topology, clocking and power can all be
+controlled through the Lochnagar, allowing the device under test
+to be used in a variety of possible use cases.
+
+This binding document describes the binding for the audio portion
+of the driver.
+
+This binding must be part of the Lochnagar MFD binding:
+  [4] ../mfd/cirrus,lochnagar.txt
+
+Required properties:
+
+  - compatible : One of the following strings:
+                 "cirrus,lochnagar2-soundcard"
+
+  - #sound-dai-cells : Must be set to 1.
+
+  - clocks : Contains an entry for each entry in clock-names.
+  - clock-names : Must include the following clocks:
+      "mclk" Master clock source for the sound card, should normally
+      be set to LOCHNAGAR_SOUNDCARD_MCLK provided by the Lochnagar
+      clock driver.
+
+Example:
+
+lochnagar-sc {
+	compatible = "cirrus,lochnagar2-soundcard";
+
+	#sound-dai-cells = <1>;
+
+	clocks = <&lochnagar_clk LOCHNAGAR_SOUNDCARD_MCLK>;
+	clock-names = "mclk";
+};
