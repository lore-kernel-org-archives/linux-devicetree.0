DT graphs only have port numbers, the endpoints are not referred to by
IDs --- just phandles. The closest equivalent we have in ACPI is a
device reference as far as I can tell, and this is why the port number
and some identifier for the endpoint is required.

Adding a numeric ID for the endpoint is somewhat artificial. Most would
just have zero there as there are commonly only a single endpoint in a
port. And if there were more than one, one of the most sensible
approaches to number them would be a monotonically incrementing number
from zero --- which is the same than the index.

So my view is that adding an endpoint property simply adds no value.
