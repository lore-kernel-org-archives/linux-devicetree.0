By suggested, you mean implemented because that is what it currently
does. My suggestion now is to do this:

for (endpoint = 0; endpoint < SOME_REASONABLE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENDPOINTS;
endpoint++) {
  ret = atmel_hlcdc_attach_endpoint(dev, endpoint);
  if (ret == -ENODEV)
    continue;
  // handle other errors?
}

And SOME_REASONABLE_MAX_NUMBER_OF_ENDPOINTS is something you make up
based on how many connections any board will have and physics (I
suppose you could have trees worth of buffers, but really what is the
worst case in an actual board design?). I would think 4 would be
plenty. If not, double it to 8.
