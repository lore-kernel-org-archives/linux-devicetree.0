I'm not sure this will be good ideal. We will have one EVB with all
possible peripheries. On the other hand, we are planning 3-4 different
SOM204 modules (A20, A64, RK....). I think this will make the dtsi 
incompatible.

Maybe if there is one dtsi for the base SOM204 module (one for each 
arch) and
multiple dts for boards with additional features. But this will generate 
10-20
dts files. I think this will be better handled using overlays in the uboot.

About the leds, I'm ok to be named after full board name (a20-som204-evb).
