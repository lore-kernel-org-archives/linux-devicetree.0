Yes you are right, we should cover that case too. But maybe we
can wait until we have such an example :)

Yes that's doable.

Yup, I think this is the way to go for now, see below..

..but let's not add this. The reason why I'd like to postpone adding
pinctrl-single,functions-in-register is because we may be able to
do it automatically.

If it was just the naming is the issue, we could use the submask
for the naming the bits with something like 0x0x48002274-3-1 and
0x0x48002274-1-1.

But I think currently the pinctrl framework expects a static pin
table, so we can't create these entries dynamically when the
consumer driver starts using the bits. So the right fix there
would be to improve the pinctrl framework to allow adding pins
dynamically, see some of the REVISIT comments in pinctrl-single.c.

> In both cases we still need to test overlaps in the handled bits.

Yes that's missing too.

So how about we do the following for now:

1. Fix the pinctrl-single,bits naming to use 0x0x48002274-1-1 to
   represent the bit range

2. Automatically create entries for each bit and don't yet support
   bit ranges except in the naming for future use

3. Add something to check the overlaps in the submasks

4. Assume we have one-bit-per-mux until we have a real example,
   then improve the pinctrl framework to allow adding pins 
   dynamically as the consumer driver probes. Or if there are
   other issues, add the pinctrl-single,functions-in-register
   property at that point.

Tony
