My point is that the DT files I _now_ have are quite different in
organisation to the ones I submitted to you, so there's going to be
conflicts if your version goes in.

Moreover, I don't want the old ones in 3.14 as-is, because I don't want
declarations which should not have been in the microsom file but in the
hummingboard file being in a final release of the mainline kernel.
