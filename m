Agreed. In the attempt at probing dependencies before a device is
probed, I considered that a device's parent is also a dependency and
that worked well. From what I saw, few devices will defer their probe
if their parent hasn't been probed yet, assuming that it will have
probed already. But with simple-mfd and simple-bus that shouldn't be
relied upon as things will break if their parents defer their probe.
With async probing enabled this failure scenario becomes more
probable.

Agreed.

Thanks,
