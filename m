Well, it seems that I can't even go back to my original set of firmware
as UEFI has stopped working:

NOTICE:  Booting Trusted Firmware
NOTICE:  BL1: v1.0(release):14b6608
NOTICE:  BL1: Built : 14:15:51, Sep  1 2014

UEFI firmware (version v2.1 built at 14:41:56 on Oct 23 2014)
Warning: Fail to load FDT file 'juno.dtb'.

and UEFI is the most unfriendly thing going - the "boot manager" thing
doesn't let you view the configuration:

[1] Linux from NOR Flash
[2] Shell
[3] Boot Manager
Start: 3
[1] Add Boot Device Entry
[2] Update Boot Device Entry
[3] Remove Boot Device Entry
[4] Reorder Boot Device Entries
[5] Update FDT path
[6] Set Boot Timeout
[7] Return to main menu
Choice:

and dropping into the shell... well, I've no idea how to get a listing
of what it thinks is in the NOR device (or even how to refer to the
NOR device.)  "devices" shows nothing that's even remotely English.

So... my Juno is now useless to me - nothing more than a paperweight,
so this is now _high_ priority.
