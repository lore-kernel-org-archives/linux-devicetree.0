Actually no ;) I started questioning this reply as soon as I sent it.
the moto so far as been "we expose what's needed" but there is many ways to
interpret that.

DT bindings is an ABI. Simply because we don't use part of that ABI upstream,
doesn't mean we shouldn't provide it. My previous statement was clearly wrong
about this, apologies.

Agreed
Since Helmut tested it, this clock should be added to the dtsi.

You are right. This could be part of another series.
I guess this patch fine as it is.
