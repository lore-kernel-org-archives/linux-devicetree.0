I honestly have no idea what you are talking about here. You see
rebellion and argument where there is none.

I am not fighting anyone, but you seem to think we are rebelling.

The reality is that the platform topology is not finalized yet, and
submitting and merging what are essentially draft version of DT
descriptions and then having to update them is something we are trying
very hard to avoid. There is enough churn in upstream DTs as it is.

We are working very hard to make sure the upstream bindings and
drivers in the kernel are in shape to support the SoC we are
developing firmware support for. When the time comes, we may or may
not decide to propose the SoC DT for inclusion in the kernel. But
those are two different things.

This has nothing to do with 'rebelling against linux.git' (your words)

I understand all that. But being able to review SoC DTs is one thing,
and deciding that the kernel repository shall be the authoritative
source is another.

In my view, this argues for having a shared repository, mailing list
etc between the Linux, u-boot, freebsd and EDK2 communities, because
it would increase review coverage, and make it easier to push back
against frivolous DT changes.

By 'these platforms' you mean 96boards? Fair point. But please don't
extrapolate from Hikey (and FYI, Cello has been running mainline Linux
and EDK2 from the beginning)

You say that like it's a bad thing. Do you honestly think it is better
for the OS to pick its own DT from some tarball that shipped with it?

If the kernel driver developers wouldn't keep making backward
incompatible changes to the bindings, they could actually stabilize to
the point where it makes even more sense for the platform vendor to
fix bugs in their DT descriptions.

Who's ranting now?

Again, please don't extrapolate. For the SynQuacer based platform we
are involved with, there will be no vendor trees whatsoever. And I
share your frustration, especially when it comes to HiKey, because
they claim to implement UEFI (but building your own bootloader from
some random collection of EDK2 source files !=3D UEFI), and keep trying
to upstream it.

Everything we need in the kernel and EDK2 will be upstream before the
product ships, and we are trying to do the same for ARM Trusted
Firmware, but this is a bit problematic due to the sorry state the
code is in.

Again, I am not the one who is ranting here. You hit a nerve by
accusing me of 'rebelling against linux.git' while this is quite the
opposite of what I am doing.
