After looking more, I find the main purpose of this switch is
what it writes, FORCE DSI SELECTION TO USB HOST MODE

When the switch is on, the system is host-only.
When the switch is off, the default role is device mode, and
switch the role through gpio USB_SW_SEL_PM by software.

At some designs, this gpio is tied to ID pin at MicroB connector, and
using a Mirco-AB cable to switch the role.

#1 and #2 can't be supported at the same time. For #3, it is not the
use case for this design. #3 is usually used for the single port which
needs to support switching role on the fly without disconnection.
So, you may only need to consider #2, you can't use extcon-usb-gpio.c
directly since you need to set one gpio to mux the dp/dm, Baolu Lu had
USB MUX patch set before which may satisfy your requirement. [1]
