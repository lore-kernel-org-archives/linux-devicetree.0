Integrator/CP, on the other hand, looks much more SP804-like.

If so, I'd expect to see patch 1 changing readl()s to readw()s at least somewhere. Otherwise, if it's merely that the clocksource API needs to know the upper 16 bits of a word it reads are undefined, then since that's the standard behaviour I'd be inclined to add it to the driver as a canonical "arm,amba-timer" implementation, then have your implementation-specific compatible on top of that just in case.

No actually the bus access is 32bit but the counter is 24bit wide instead of 16bit, so the clocksource won't work and the system time will furiously drift. It's not the case of the clockevent since the delay fits in 24 bits.

It also seems is ignores the 32BIT config bit, so it seems based on the initial 16bit only reference design.

How do you think I should implement this ?
