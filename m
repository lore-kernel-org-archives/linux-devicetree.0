Sure.  I thought about that but naming stuff here has been a sort
of ongoing struggle...  "Kona" made some sense, in some cases,
but it's not perfect.  Simlar with "mobile."

I'll propose "kona_smp.c".  OK with you?  Unless I get a better
suggestion I'll plan to go with that next time around.

Thanks.
