Could you look around for AXP808 datasheets?

Is it. Back then when I added USB support I didn't notice the PHYs
had separate power supplies, and 2 even. This will be reworked in
the future.

The hub and device power sequencing stuff is being worked on, though
I've lost track of the progress. I don't think regulators were included
in the initial proposal though.
