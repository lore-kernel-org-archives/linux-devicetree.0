I think your use case may be more compelling than two flavors of Beaglebone
(one of which is pretty much a dead stick), but it's also less clear what your
design constraints are (not that I really want to know, 'cause I don't).

But the logical extension of this is an N-way dtb that supports unrelated SOCs,
and I think most would agree that's not an acceptable outcome.

My thought was that every design that can afford an EEPROM to probe can afford
a bootloader to select the appropriate dtb, and can afford the extra space
required for multiple dtbs.

I'm not naysaying; I just want to elicit enough information so the community
can make informed decisions.

I agree; that would be The Wrong Way.

Agreed; hardware is what it is.

I was thinking back to the introductions of fast DEVSEL# and AGP :(

My thoughts exactly. Apologies if something I wrote came across as
"You Shall Not Pass" :)

One issue seems to be the moving target that is the compelling use case(s).
The initial submission implied it was the Beaglebone, which comes with
4GB eMMC/microSD so naturally the argument for space-savings with DTBs doesn't
fly. That has since been clarified so no need to rehash that.
