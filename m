Hi Rob,

Thank you for the review.

I'll add that.

That appears to be an established practice in the implementation of the
device / fwnode property API.

One option could be to choose the relevant ops struct based on fwnode type
in each function operating on the fwnode.

Alternatively it could be set at the time when the fwnode field is set. A
large number of drivers are manipulating their OF nodes, some do that for
fwnodes as well. Manually setting the ops struct pointer in those cases
might not be robust enough: sometimes one could simply forget. Also, adding
a pointer to struct fwnode_handle would increase the size of the struct
significantly without much gain.

The number of functions operating on fwnode_handle is rather limited. I
wonder if it'd be simply better to keep it as-is.

I have to admit my experience in using them is limited to V4L2, but I have
to say they've been working pretty well for what they're used for. Actually
the graph functionality was originally specific for V4L2, that could be the
reason why the current API is a good fit for V4L2. :-)

The current use ACPI use case is related to V4L2 as well (I'll post a new
version in the near future):

<URL:http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-media/msg106160.html>

Are there any particular pain points that should be addressed?

I noticed Kunimori Morimoto's patchset adding of_graph_get_remote_endpoint()
which is just a new convenience function to the current API.
