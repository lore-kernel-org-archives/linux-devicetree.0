Looks sane to me.  It might be interesting to be explicit about what
happens if "regulator-allowed-modes" doesn't include the mode that was
listed as "regulator-initial-mode".  Does that mean that there's no
way to get back to "regulator-initial-mode" after it's been changed
once, or is it an error to not include the initial mode in the set of
allowed modes?

I'm not 100% sure if going to such detail is necessary though.  Thus,
feel free to add:
