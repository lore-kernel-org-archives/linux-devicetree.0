If there is some reason why it would be desirable to deselect
the DDC I2C bus after transactions, that could be added as an option
to the GPIO I2C mux, but I can't think of a reason.

Only if the mux's I2C slave is on the near side of the mux so that
it's always addressable regardless of mux state, and if it's on the
same I2C.

It's connected to: (a) an I2C, and (b) a GPIO.

It can't be child of both, but I don't see why the GPIO can't be
referred by phandle and the I2C it's muxing be the direct parent.
That seems more natural to me.

All the best,
