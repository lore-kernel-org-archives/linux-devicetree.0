Well, OK.

Can you please have a look at these patchse in v4:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5040161/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5040081/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5040061/

We now have an ACK from Dmitry on the gpio_keys_polled thing and Bryan
said he was OK with the leds changes already in v2 (IIRC).

Also Alexandre is saying that he's not opposed to the changes in
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/5040161/, although there may be a better
way.

And we have AKCs from Greg on the driver core changes, so it looks like
GPIO really is the only missing thing and we need that code to support
our hardware.
