We already have a bunch of DT code that knows about and uses the
external widgets the device has (which are I'd guess the only ones where
this is an issue)?  I was thinking just have a property that lists the
widgets that should never be turned on.

I'm really having a lot of trouble seeing MICBIAS_OFF as a useful
voltage to specify in DT in the first place.
