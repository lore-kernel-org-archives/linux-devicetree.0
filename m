Sorry for the incompleteness of the devicetree conversion. I'm sending a
patch (separately) that makes it possible to specify everything via
devicetree, so you can choose between dt and platform data.

Except in case of callback specification (dma_filter()), you need to
provide platform data.

Interestingly, when I removed the actual platform data from the board
file, I noticed that I still needed to specify a device name (like
dev:ssp0) to make it work. But this seems to be expected according to
the documentation of OF_DEV_AUXDATA(). Are there any plans or ideas how
to fix this?

When we have sorted out this driver change (please check the new pl022
specific dt property names!), I will provide patches for arm-soc to
actually use this new interface via dts files.

Thanks in advance,

Roland
