After reading through a bit of code, I am confident that I can
modify the resolver code to not modify the various phandle
property values.  There are a few tentacles reaching out to
other areas that I will have to fix also.  The biggest task
for me will be to create some good test code.

I'll be unavailable this week, so I'll start on it in about
a week.
