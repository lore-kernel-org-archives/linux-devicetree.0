You are reading the schema wrong. There are 2 cases supported as
defined by each '-'. The 2nd case is all the keywords until the
indentation decreases. So 'description' is just description of the 2nd
case. The first case is just "maxItems: 1". I probably didn't put a
description because why write in free form text what the schema says
(other than of course no one knows json-schema...).

YAML combines the best of Makefiles and python. You can't have tabs
and Indentation is significant. :)

Humm, I probably just made that up based on GICv2 limitations. What
should it be? If there's not any inherit maximum, can we put something
reasonable? There's not really any way to express that it should match
the number of cores in the system.
