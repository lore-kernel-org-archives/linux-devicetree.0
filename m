Why is that? That's why that property is called "compatible", isn't it?
In my understanding a fallback name can be chosen exactly for that
purpose: where an existing driver for a binding is capable of handling
the new hardware. Yes, we add our new SoC specific name anyway (mostly
to be able to handle future driver fixes without changing all DTs).
But for that gates clock case we can do:
1) Add the new name to the bindings doc, mostly to mark it as used.
2) Use compatible="soc-specific", "generic"; in the DT. This is how it
nicely works for the USB host controllers, for instance.
There would be no pointless "code" change in Linux needed.

But that's not how it should work. The DT is meant to describe the
_hardware_, not the driver, especially not one particular one. And we
should avoid changing the DT just because we found that we need to
rework the Linux driver.
So having the actual bits used as indices makes a lot of sense to me.
Besides: any changes in the references would be DT internal, right? So
changing the clock ID in the bus gates node at the same time as the
clock reference in, say the MMC controller, would be quite natural and
ideally wouldn't break anything.

I don't see how rate changes and re-parenting shouldn't be possible with
the new approach. We just do it in firmware, which ideally owns all the
clocks. We can have comparably simple code there since firmware is by
design SoC specific, so we don't need an overly complicated and
abstracted clock framework to cover every clock on the planet.
Also we wouldn't need to expose the basic PLL clocks (like PLL_AUDIO)
themselves if that proves to be problematic, so we can change them at
firmware's discretion.

As mentioned, I don't see a reason why this shouldn't be possible. Again
this may be even simpler, since the firmware code is expected to know
about the SoC, so we don't need to think about abstracting these
relations. We could even code a special case for this I2S/codec setup,
if that turns out to be a nasty corner case. Or we find a different
static setup from the beginning.

If you still see an issue, can you detail one example where this would
clash? I am not a clock export, so eager to learn about those cases.

Why would the kernel need to know? Those SCPI clocks have no parents
known to the kernel, and ideally we don't expose any (PLL) clock that
would need to change frequency and would be subject to reparenting.

Again, if you can show me a particular counter-example, I'd be grateful.

There is supposed to be _one_ firmware for one SoC (or board), whereas
there as dozens of kernels out there - upstream plus various stable
kernels, from various distributions.
So in the worst case a fix in the kernel would have to be backported to
Debian, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Suse, RedHat, you name it.
Also rumor has it that there are kernels beside Linux out there ;-)

Yes. We can abstract this _and_ protect the PMIC from a rogue driver or
module. Accidentally setting 3.3V to a 2.5V-only Ethernet PHY would be
no longer possible, since firmware knows that his board has a 2.5V PHY.

Yes, SCPI at the moment is more "the Juno interface put into a spec".
But I find it quite useful and think we have to start abstracting those.
Also "the other guys do it as well" is not really a good argument, and I
mentioned that we should look more at the server SoCs than those various
"let's replace the A7s with A53s" SoCs.

But frankly "writing" the firmware is more like adapting an existing
version, testing and pushing this out. We don't need to go through a
lengthy process and don't have to wait for distributions to eventually
pick up the upstream kernel with the fixes merged. Look at how much less
changes U-Boot needed to run a (32-bit) version on the Pine64: a few
define's here and some ifdef's there. Then we would push this to some
firmware repository - which would be controlled by linux-sunxi. People
pick up the newest firmware from there and run an _existing_
(distribution) kernel on the board: a few weeks after the board hit some
developer. This is how x86 works (apart from that community firmware
repo) and I don't see why we shouldn't try to reach the same state for
arm (or at least arm64).

Cheers,
Andre
