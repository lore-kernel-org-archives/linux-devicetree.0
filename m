I agree about this not making much sense, but I'm not sure the right way
forward here.

Personally I wouldn't have put MicBias voltage in DT to begin with, it
is runtime configurable and depends on user runtime inserted microphone,
not really a hardware description :/

The enable/disable is controlled by a DAPM and should be wired to enable
whenever we are recording from the related microphone pin. So then
without MICBIAS_OFF the user is forced to select from the above voltages
whenever recording, which may not be correct if they are using a mic
that doesn't need bias.

The best option I think would be to drop this from DT, but I don't feel
like fighting that battle right now.
