The ask here is for the rpmh driver to call cmd_db_ready() in its probe
function and return any error encountered (e.g. -EPROBE_DEFER).

I suppose that specifying the rpmh rsc device tree node as a child inside
of the command DB node could achieve the same result.  However, that seems
a little hacky as the rsc device is describing a hardware block physically
found on the SoC as opposed to a subcomponent of the command DB SMEM data
structure.  I defer to device tree maintainers to comment on the
acceptability of this approach.

While technically it is possible for an rpmh consumer to intrinsically
know the addresses for its resources without polling command DB, do you
have any examples where this is the case?

Thanks,
David
