We have a need of exposing information like SoC ID, revision and such
which is what this nvmem framework proposes to be suitable for. Till
now I was trying a different approach for the same [1].

The On Chip One Time Programmable block on the Vybrid can be handled
nicely with this nvmem framework however I had a few queries with
regards to the framework after trying it on a Vybrid VF61 SoC. 

1. From what I understand, getting the information in hex is the only
way possible as of now? Would it be possible to expose the information
as strings from different paths under /sys/class/nvmem/*/nvmem/?

For example, if I have a sub node as below

ocotp: ocotp@400a5000 {
	compatible = "fsl,vf610-ocotp";
	reg = <0x400a5000 0x1000>;

	ocotp_cfg0: cfg0@410 {
		reg = <0x410 0x1>;
	};

	ocotp_cfg1: cfg1@420 {
		reg = <0x420 0x1>;
	};
};

The values from the above register locations represented by the two
sub nodes above can perhaps be exposed as strings? Even if they are
not exposed as strings, making them available in separate paths, is
that something which can be done? So depending on the sub node as
above, /sys/class/nvmem/ocotp0/nvmem/cfg0/ would give values from
the registers specified.

Basically the output of /sys/class/nvmem/*/nvmem being restricted
to only the subnodes specified is what I was hoping to get along
with separate paths.

2. What if the required information is scattered across different memory
regions? In my case, the SoC ID is available from one OCOTP peripheral
block, the revision is in a separate ROM area at the start of the memory
map and some CPU information I am interested in is in another memory
region. I am not sure what would be the right way to approach it with
the nvmem framework.
