Yes, and no. H3, H5, A64 and R40 have the exact same register layout, but 
different number of channels and ports. They could share a compatible (if DMA 
channels were generalized), and we already have several register offsets/
widths (implicitly via the callbacks) attached to the compatible (so these 
don't need generalization via DT).

Now, we could also move everything that is currently attached to the 
compatible, i.e. clock gate register offset, burst widths/lengths etc. into 
the devicetree binding, but that would just be too much.

The idea is to find a middle ground here, using common patterns in the 
existing SoCs. The register layout has hardly changed, while the number of DMA 
channels and ports changes all the time. Moving the number of DMA channels and 
ports to the DT is trivial, and a pattern also found in other DMA controller 
drivers. *If* the number of dma channels and ports is ever increased, 
exceeding the current maximum, this would amount to major changes in the 
driver and maybe even warrant a completely new driver.

So your argument here basically is - don't do any checks on DT provided 
values, these are always correct. So, following this argument, not only the 
range check, but also the of_property_read return values should be ignored, as 
the DT is correct, thus of_property_read will never return an error.

That clearly does not match the implementation of drivers throughout the 
various subsystems for DT properties, which is in general - do all the checks 
that can be done, trust everything you can not verify.

Kind regards,

Stefan
