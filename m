And I stand by what I've written.

You're missing the point I'm trying to make: either you can and we fit
it into the Linux model of an interrupt controller, or this thing is not
an interrupt controller at all. Either event can be individually masked,
and this can be modelled as an interrupt controller, and they cannot.

So if the IA cannot be represented as an interrupt controller and is so
specific to a particular device, move it out of the interrupt subsystem
and keep it private to your networking device.
