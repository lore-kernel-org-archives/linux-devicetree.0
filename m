The following set of patches does a bit of rework on the existing
Qualcomm SCM firmware.  The first couple of patches deals with turning
the current SCM into a platform driver.  The next couple are cleanups
that make adding the 64 support a little easier.  I added in a patch to
convert the scm-32 to use DMA streaming APIs.

I took Kumar's 64 bit support patch and modified it to use the arm_smccc
calls.  This simplified things quite a bit.

Lastly, there are a few DT patches to add the firmware node for a couple of the
supported platforms.

Changes from v5:
  * Added SCM DT nodes for APQ8064 and MSM8974
  * Make core clk optional in probe
  * Update commit messages to describe some of the changes in more detail
  * Put back some of the SCM64 helper functions
  * Fix other miscellaneous review comments

Changes from v4:
  * Fix Documentation error
  * Fix misc review comments

Changes from v3:
  * Added compatibles for the specific platforms requiring one clock.
  * All other platforms will use the generic binding that requires 3 clocks.

Changes from v2:
  * Added use of streaming DMA APIs for scm-32.
  * Changed DT binding to simplify compats.
  * Removed Kconfig.platform change that selected QCOM_SCM for ARM64
  * Fixed misc comments
  * Changed init function to populate the device differently.
  * Fixed missing of_node_put

Changes from v1:
  * Changed binding to reflect proper firmware node usage
  * Added arch_initcall to populate the firmware device, if present
  * Fixed various review comments
  * Removed extraneous includes from SCM 64 file.
