Ok, I will add these explanation to comment section.

These are the extra options that we used to pass in the kernel. For
normal operation, I couldn't perceive any difference without these
properties. The only reason for adding these properties was to be in
sync with existing auxiliary control value.

No specific reasons for this. I was following "arm,data-latency"
format. We can drop the "arm," prefix.
