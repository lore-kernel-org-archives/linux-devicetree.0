They've been called machine drivers for years. If you find this confusing
I'd suggest qualifying the name ("ASoC machine drivers"), I don't think
renaming them would be worthwhile just for PowerPC. Given the similarity
of their role I'm having a hard time seeing the overlap as a bad thing even
for the people who have difficulty with this.
