It doesn't feel right to obsolete the "hardkernel,odroid-xu4-audio"
compatible, there is significant difference between XU3 and XU4 - there
is no audio CODEC on XU4, this board only supports audio over HDMI interface.
XU4 could be compatible with XU3, but not the other way around.
It just happens we have other DT properties that help to handle such HW 
design difference.

Moreover, only XU4 is still in production and should be in few more years [1], 
others are obsoleted now.

So I think we should keep at least these 2 compatible strings:

- "hardkernel,odroid-xu3-audio" - for boards with audio CODEC,
- "hardkernel,odroid-xu4-audio" - for boards without audio CODEC, 
   supporting only HDMI interface.
