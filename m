To be specific (whether this is 'to shreds' or not, you can decide).

1. amba_bus expects the old ARM primcell ID. The one in the new A9 IP
appears to be different. (b105900d instead of b105f00d)

2. Not only does amba_bus reference apb_pclk, but the driver directly
references emu_src_clk. Neither of these has direct analogs on our
hardware.

3. Implementing the workaround for 2 that you've described requires a
dummy implementation of the 'standard' clock stuff, which is currently
not implemented by mach-xilinx, because we simply haven't needed it. 
Is the right solution here to add more machine-specific code?

4. etm is old, we have ptm and other custom cores, but the driver
combines the etm and etb functionality together. 

OK, some of this is trivial to fix, but some of it isn't.

At this point, I've sortof come full circle.  Since the mainline driver
doesn't solve the problem anyway, we'll probably just look at driving
the
trace hardware from userspace for the moment, until we figure out what
should be exported from a kernelspace driver.

I'm very intrigued by the OMAP strategy that uses platform_bus.  When I
get to return to this, I'll have to look into it in more depth.
