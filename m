I sent a patch that takes the .oper_speed out completely and only applies it for the ACPI based devices where we know that it works.

Once Loic’s resends the patches we can get them into bluetooth-next and start merging these towards upstream. After that, Bluetooth should work just out of the box like with any USB dongle.

I also meet this Frame reassembly failure, Seems we receive a 0x00 byte 
from the controller (unknown pkt type).

Regarding the speed, I'm unable to reach 3Mbps, I selected 921600 
because this is the baudrate used by raspbian bt script.

Maybe they had some issues at higher speed (empirical value ?), However 
2Mbps seems ok on my side (need to double check/adjust).

In a second step, need to check If we can use hardware flow control, I 
heard that pin 16&17 are routed to the bcm RTS/CTS.
Since there is no DMA usage, it could help.

Loic
