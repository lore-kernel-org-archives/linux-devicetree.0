I think that to solve this problem, we need to stop treating
clocksources and clockevent devices as completely separate device types,
and instead treat them as particular cases of a more general clock
device.

That way, a driver can register a single device, with flags saying
whether it is:

* a clocksource only
* a clockevent device only
* both a clocksource and clockevent device
* both, but mutually exclusive at runtime

... and thus drivers don't have to make an impossible decision up-front
as to how the device should be used.

As more devices get registered, the core timekeeping code can improve on
its choices and re-assign devices.

That doesn't solve the case where a clock device may use resources we
want for something else, but I think we can solve that separately.

Thanks,
Mark.
