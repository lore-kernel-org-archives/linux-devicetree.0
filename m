Yes, I figured that out. :-)

Still, the <rev> property value is used for something somewhere in the code I gather.

Yes, I would do that, and actually not using the index for the endpoint too.

Let ports and endpoints be symmetrical in that respect, that is a port is
required to have a { "port", id } property and an endpoind is required to
have a { "endpoint", id } property and let the ids be used in
"remote-endpoint" properties as per the above.

Then, in each case, the id would be whatever the value of the <rev> property
on the DT side would be.

Well, to me, using indices should not even be taken into consideration as
a viable approach in similar cases.

I know that using indices is a common practice in the ACPI land, but IMO that's
not a good one.
