Wow, that's interesting. Seems they invested some real effort to catch =

instead of simply modifying their old patches. Which is a compliment to=

Maybe we should try to get one of the Rockchip developers on board. The=

have thought about this kind of thing as well.

Thanks for providing the register mappings.

Yes, if you do specify the mappings as you proposed it would be a night=
mare.

However, this sheds light on an underlying issue: Rockchip is not treat=
ing the=20
whole GPIO block as one cohesive device as we do currently. Instead, it=
 seems=20
to me, one GPIO bank is one device. Each has its cohesive mux, bank and=
 pull=20
registers - apart from rk3188-bank-0, maybe. But that one is special an=
yway=20
with regards to register ordering (s.b.).

The issues you had with RK3188 and now have with RK3288 seem to stem fr=
om=20
trying to group all banks together into one pinctrl driver.

So maybe we should promote the GPIO banks to full devices in the dt and=
 make=20
smaller mappings for each GPIO bank, i.e. three mappings for each GPIO =
bank=20
(mux, bank, pull). I know we have to stay backwards compatible dt-wise,=
 but=20
that should be doable.

Then we are fully flexible and don't need any conditionals or address=20
calculation logic. And should a future SoC bring another layout inside =
the=20
banks, we can react with a new "compatible"-name (and maybe a completel=
y=20
separate driver, if the change is big enough).

Whatever a "hardware block" is. n:m mappings between devices and clocks=
 are no=20
problems in the dt. So why not describe things a bit more precisely?

Yes, that sounds a bit like the mess we are dealing with ;-)
I still feel that declaring everything as syscon is somehow circumventi=
ng the=20
dt. And I feel more comfortable declaring GRF_SOC_* as "miscellaneous=20
registers" rather than e.g. the iomux space of GPIO0.

Don't get me wrong please, I'm not completely against the syscon idea. =
I'm=20
just trying to have a full discussion on the issue.

Nice, but you needed to introduce flags like "SOURCE_PMU/GRF" which wou=
ld not=20
be necessary with the fine-grained mapping. GPIO-Only could be handled =
by a=20
mask specified in the dt.

       /*
		 * The bits in these registers have an inverse ordering
		 * with the lowest pin being in bits 15:14 and the highest
		 * pin in bits 1:0
		 */
		*bit =3D 7 - (pin_num % RK3188_PULL_PINS_PER_REG);

(from rk3188_calc_pull_reg_and_bit)

That's probably still a peculiarity of rk3188-bank0, isn't it? So we'd =
still=20
need a conditional on rk3188-bank0. That could enable a fourth mapping =
for the=20
split up mux space of bank0 as well.

Compared to your RK3288 patch we'd be moving the information from the t=
able in=20
your driver (which is just describing the hw layout & capabilities) int=
o the=20
dt.

Agreed, that's probably not an issue (if no one wants to do high-speed=20

Okay, sorry for misunderstanding.

Yes, let's hope someone else speaks up. Maybe there has already been a=20
precedent in another mach-*? I'll try to find something similar.
In the end you as the maintainer have to make the decision though. And =
as I=20
said I don't have real problems with the syscon solution, it just doesn=
't feel=20
nice.
