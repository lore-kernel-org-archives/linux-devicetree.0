It's a term I picked up from of_clk_detect_critical()

  * Do not use this function. It exists only for legacy Device Tree
  * bindings, such as the one-clock-per-node style that are outdated.
  * Those bindings typically put all clock data into .dts and the Linux

  * correctly from the driver. Only those drivers may call
  * of_clk_detect_critical from their setup functions.

But they are not exactly the same. For example, PLL0 has 7 PLLDIV clocks while
PLL1 only has 3. PLL0 has PREDIV while PLL1 does not. PLL0 has certain SYSCLKs
that are fixed-ratio but PLL1 does not have any of these. There are even more
differences, but these are the ones we are actually using.

So, if we use the same compatible, we either have to come up with device tree
bindings to describe all of this (yuck) or I suppose we can look at the REVID
register to electronically determine exactly what we have. I went with the
simpler option of just creating two different compatible strings.
