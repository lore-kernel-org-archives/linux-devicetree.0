Ok, let me try to explain the functionality.

Probe time hw pointer registration is only needed for special clocks 
that require extra flags, like adding the spread spectrum flag. There is 
ever going to be only handful of these.

Xlate checks out the sci_clk list, and picks up an existing hw clock if 
it is there. If not, it will create a new one. The reason this is done 
like this, the device IDs / clock IDs don't mean anything to the driver 
itself, the driver just passes these forward to the underlying SCI fwk. 
And, we don't have inherent knowledge of valid device / clock IDs 
either, the SCI fwk returns a failure if a specific clock ID is bad. The 
device / clock IDs are going to be different between different 
generations of SoC also, and in addition there can be holes in the ID 
ranges.
