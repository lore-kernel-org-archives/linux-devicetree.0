I suppose it might even be possible to define the ACPI references to
have an optional string, so you can do

         Package () {
                 Package () { ^ref1, data, data }, 
                 Package () { "foo", ^ref2, data, data, data },
         }

The parser should be able to interpret both anonymous and named
references just by looking at the type of the first member.
You might not want to allow mixing them in a single property, but
that is more a style question than a technical requirement.
