No, this is not must be.

Yes, this is just programming mistake. I'll revise it.

In this case the transmitter should be the last enabled and the first disabled.

Because in Vybrid the transmitter bit clock and frame sync are to be used by both the transmitter and receiver, and only this case can be used here, so now I only handle this case.

I'll implement them later if needed.
