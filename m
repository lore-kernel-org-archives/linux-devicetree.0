Instead of struct property field value being a pointer into the
FDT, I would rather copy the data to newly allocated memory and
have value be a pointer to that memory.  This is required if we
want to make /sys/firmware/fdt optional, which would allow us to
free the memory containing the initial boot FDT.

I also do not want overlay live subtrees to have any pointers
into the FDT that was used to populate the overlay, so copying
the data solves that problem also.

Yes, the resolver code needs to adjust phandle values.

I think I can get rid of the resolver modifying the various phandle
values, and instead just modify the phandle value in struct
device_node.  At the same time, I think I can also remove all
instances of the phandle properties ('linux,phandle', 'ibm,phandle',
'phandle') in the live tree.  These properties should not be
accessed directly by any code outside of the device tree framework
since the phandle is located in the struct device_node.  A quick
grep does not show any such accesses of the phandle properties,
but I want to look more closely.

That would complicate the overlay code.  Once adjustments are done to
the phandle property value, the overlay code does not need to special
case phandle - phandle is just another property.  I am hoping I can
instead modify the resolver code as I described above.

I would prefer not to hide an assignment in the middle of a statement.

Nit: I would prefer 'value' to 'b'.  'value' would make the pr_debug longer
that 80 characters, which could be resolved by removing 'for ':

                        pr_debug("fixed up name %s -> %s\n", nodename, value);

What is the result when all of the files that touch value are compiled?
Any warnings or errors?
