In most cases, the fallback is there in situations when support for the
older or more generic device type can work with the new device, albeit
at lower efficiency or without full functionality.

Using a specific one with the "syscon" doesn't quite make sense to me
either, but some platforms, like Rockchip, do use it. I suppose it would
help them identify the type of syscon, but I think that is really tied
to the consumer.

You mean having something like the following?

    compatible = "allwinner,sun50i-a64-system-control",
                 "allwinner,sun50i-a64-system-controller";

Well, the "system-controller" compatible was never listed in any binding,
and it shouldn't have been there in the first place. And I think having
the compatibles match up with the datasheet is better. Last, it is not
an actual "controller". It is just a set of control registers.
