I don't want to hijack this thread, but in RISC-V land we were hoping to have a 
user ABI free of 32-bit time_t.  Our 32-bit glibc ABI hasn't been finalized 
yet, and when I talked to the glibc guys a few weeks ago they were happy to let 
us wait until 32-bit time_t can be removed before we stabilize the ABI.  We've 
been maintaining out-of-tree glibc patches for a while now, so I'd really like 
to get them into the next glibc release.

Mapping out the schedule more explicitly, as I'm terrible with dates:

* 4.19-rc4 was 2018-09-16
* 4.19 should be 2018-10-21
* 4.20 should be 2019-01-13 (skipping 2 weeks for the holidays)
* 4.21 merge window should close 2019-01-27
* glibc 2.29 is scheduled for 2019-02-01

That's very tight, but assuming we at least have a prototype of the API so we 
can get the rv32i glibc patches in much earlier it might be OK.  There was some 
talk of being able to use some workarounds to do a 32-bit time_t user ABI 
without the cooresponding kernel ABI, so we could always go down that route to 
start and then decide to deprecate or not deprecate the 32-bit kernel ABI at 
the last minute -- not something I'm fond of doing, but an option.

How close to done do you think the 32-bit time_t will be by the end of the 4.20 
merge window?  If it's close enough to start our glibc push then that might be 
OK.
