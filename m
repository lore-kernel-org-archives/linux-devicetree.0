For this option you can use the branch mvebu/drivers located at
 git://git.infradead.org/linux-mvebu.git.

In this branch there is the commit "bus: mvebu-mbus: add mv_mbus_dram_info_nooverlap()"
but not only this one because it depends also on fixes which have been
merged in this same branch.

This branch is immutable and have already been merged in arm-soc.

Thanks,

Gregory
