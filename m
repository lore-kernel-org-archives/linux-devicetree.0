Well, you have to put the date when you worked on the driver.

I didn't come around yet.

ack.

maybe "inactive"? Then then you should better use nconfig as dts name
(as done in the barebox binding) and put the active low information into
the flag.

The barebox driver sends two bytes.

And I think it's hard to detect if the adapter driver supports this or
simply ignores it.
