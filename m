It could be simpler.
Since flexrm_send_data() is essentially about putting the message in
the ring-buffer (and not about _transmission_ failures), the
last_tx_done() should simply return true if requests_ida has not all
ids allocated. False otherwise.

That is already supported :)

In drivers/dma/bcm-sba-raid.c

sba_send_mbox_request(...)
{
           ......
        req->msg.error = 0;
        ret = mbox_send_message(sba->mchans[mchans_idx], &req->msg);
        if (ret < 0) {
                dev_err(sba->dev, "send message failed with error %d", ret);
                return ret;
        }
        ret = req->msg.error;
        if (ret < 0) {
                dev_err(sba->dev, "message error %d", ret);
                return ret;
        }
          .....
}

Here you _do_ assume that as soon as the mbox_send_message() returns,
the last_tx_done() is true. In other words, this is a case of client
'knows_txdone'.

So ideally you should specify cl->knows_txdone = true during
mbox_request_channel() and have ...

sba_send_mbox_request(...)
{
        ret = mbox_send_message(sba->mchans[mchans_idx], &req->msg);
        if (ret < 0) {
                dev_err(sba->dev, "send message failed with error %d", ret);
                return ret;
        }

        ret = req->msg.error;

       /* Message successfully placed in the ringbuffer, i.e, done */
       mbox_client_txdone(sba->mchans[mchans_idx], ret);

       if (ret < 0) {
                dev_err(sba->dev, "message error %d", ret);
                return ret;
        }

        .....
}

This way MBOX_TX_QUEUE_LEN should be more than enough and pose no bottleneck.
