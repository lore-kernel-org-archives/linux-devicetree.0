If I delete imx7d.dtsi and add imx7s.dtsi in a single commit, and then
readd imx7d.dtsi in a second commit, it would break bisect-ability. All
existing device trees which include imx7d.dtsi would fail to build.

As soon as I keep imx7d.dtsi around, even if it only includes
imx7s.dtsi, git diff stats look dramatic with git default options.

Using -B -M makes the diff stat a bit less dramatic:

 arch/arm/boot/dts/imx7d.dtsi                 | 1083
+++++++++++---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 arch/arm/boot/dts/{imx7d.dtsi => imx7s.dtsi} |   79 +------
 2 files changed, 130 insertions(+), 1032 deletions(-)

However, that is only for stats, and only when using those options...

I would rather prefer to keep it in a single commit. What do you think?
