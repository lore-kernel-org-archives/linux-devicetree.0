For some reason, GPIO properties have always been named "gpios" rather
than "gpio", even when only a single entry is expected. I don't really
understand why, but I've been asked (or seen others asked) to
s/gpio/gpios/ in DT bindings before. I explicitly CC'd Grant and Rob
here in case they can shed any light.

I think people filling in platform data should simply be required to
put a valid/correct value in that field. There aren't any users of
this, so it's not like adding a new field where
backwards-compatibility might be a concern (and even then, updating
all users of this platform data type wouldn't be hard), and it should
be obvious if you get it wrong.
