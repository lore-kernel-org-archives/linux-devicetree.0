Simplicity and ease of use should be the goals here.  Testers should
not have to write applications to use this driver.  Can we come up
with a simple/effective method that uses SYSFS/DEBUGFS please?

The easiest way I can think of which avoids markers/separators AND the
requirement for users to have to write applications is to have two
files, 'signal' and 'message' as mentioned before.  Once both are
populated I can get this driver to draft the message appropriately and
fire it off.
