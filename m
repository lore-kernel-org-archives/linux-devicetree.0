Hi Cross:
First of all, Thanks for your efforts to summit the imx pcie support patches.
I looked through your patch-set, and have some concerns:
* PCIe driver used in the FSL linux-2.6.35 BSP, is not good enough,
Based on the latest FSL BSP.
* The PCIe switch/MSI features had been supported.
* In order to support the 8MB memory space size, the mem layout had been updated as listed below,
 otherwise, the memory space size required by PCIe EP device wouldn't larger than 4MB.
        /*
         * i.MX6 defines 16MB in the AXI address map for PCIe.
         *
         * That address space excepted the pcie registers is
         * split and defined into different regions by iATU,
         * with sizes and offsets as follows:
         *
         * RC:
         * 0x0100_0000 --- 0x01DF_FFFF 14MB IORESOURCE_MEM
         * 0x01E0_0000 --- 0x01EF_FFFF 1MB IORESOURCE_IO
         * 0x01F0_0000 --- 0x01FF_FFFF 1MB Cfg + MSI + Registers
         *
         * EP (default value):
         * 0x0100_0000 --- 0x01FF_C000 16MB - 16KB IORESOURCE_MEM
         */

* BTW, the PCIe EP mode had been verified too.

Best Regards
Richard Zhu

I'll pull from arm-soc rather than from Linus' tree and place the driver there instead.

Exynos5440 appears to use the same port logic controller.  However, the PHYs are different.  I'm not exactly certain which comments you want me to notice in that series of patchsets, but I see references to splitting Exynos-specific code into its own project.  Based on that, it seems like the best approach would be to:

    1) Move Exynos code into its own file, say, pcie-exynos.c.  This would leave only Synopsys-specific ATC code in pcie-designware.c
    2) Rename generic exynos functions to reflect the fact that they're designware-generic functions.
    3) Have pcie-imx.c reference this generic designware ATC code.

I'll rework the patch and re-submit it following these three changes.
