Really the error message is quite out of character in general,
we don't normally print the func and it doesn't really say what
failed. I will refactor it.

This is one of those technically situations. We have to do
the reads and we have to have at least 300uS after those.
Normally there will be enough slack in the system but better to
guarantee it. Maybe a comment?

Regrettably yes, or well at least I am sure that despite a lot of
complaining this is what the hardware guys insisted needed done.

Yeah I will update that one.

I will have a look and see if we might do a generic helper
function for this one.

Overall the lock protects anything that changes a rate on the
chip, since we have to do that weird spin_sysclk thing
before/after anything that does that.

It might normally be safe without the lock here I guess, since
you are only really protecting against the reads of adsp_rate_cache.
But suppose that might depend on the architecture if the read/writes
arn't effectively atomic (although that is probably unlikely on most
modern architectures).

Yup will fix that.

No problem to fix that too.

I do vaguely remember some discussion that it was preferred
that people had to think about which delay function to call,
rather than having a generic helper. TBF I could probably
just switch it all to use msleep, for the most part this is
a quite small optimisation of path bring up (although it was
asked for by one of our customers).
