Paul,

You can see on our schematics that the hinged sdhc card slot is an
assembly option and not the default.
https://wiki.solid-run.com/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=3Dimx6:cubox-i:schematic=
s-rev-1.1:cubox-i-lower.pdf

You have either an initial early developer unit (pre-production) that
was assembled like this for testing, or a unit that someone
specifically ordered assembled this way.  You can see from the
schematic that this option does not have a CD-pin because it is meant
to be a more permanent storage option.

That being said, this is not a default option and therefore should not
be merged into the mainline device-tree.  Our soms and carriers are
designed to be very flexible regarding the assembly options and we try
to mainline device-tree files that represent the most common assembly
options.  Once there is a common accepted mainlining for device-tree
fragments for overlays, that would be the proper place to make this
change.  Although in this case you would also need a custom u-boot so
it is probably best to just handle the change there.  If you would
like touch base with me off list and I can point you at the required
u-boot changes.

Thanks,
Jon
