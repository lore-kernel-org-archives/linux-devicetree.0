looking at the git history in arch/arm64/boot/dts/amlogic: it seems
that we don't have a rule yet, even though some (some of
your's/Neil's/my) patches were using that naming schema in the past

maybe it's just a problem of a false initial impression
I read "arm64: dts: meson-axg: add usb power regulator" in the
cover-letter and came to the conclusion that this patch must be wrong
since meson-axg.dtsi should not have any regulators (unless they're
built into the SoC). only when looking at the patch itself I realized
that it's fine because it patches the s400.dts

Martin
