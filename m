Hmm... That's a little sub-optimal in the case that a bootloader is
patching this. Presumably a bootloader that needs an existing node won't
patch the unit-address to match the reg (which might not start at 0).

I'd rather not have the unit-address than have an incorrect
unit-address, though I guess we don't have much of a choice here, unless
there's some override we can place in the dts.

The above might match reserved-memory nodes; it might be better to check
for 'device_type\s*=\s*"memory"'.

I assume that was run after deleting the memory node from the skeletons?

Otherwise, that looks fairly convincing!

Thanks,
Mark.
