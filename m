Good catch. I've added a if (!ci_otg_is_fsm_mode()) check here.

Can you elaborate? Is it bad that we keep it "locked" while we're in
host or device mode? It looked like we paired the start/stop ops with
each other so that the mux is properly managed across these ops. My
testing hasn't shown a problem, but maybe there's some corner case
you're thinking of? I'll double check the code.
