Hi6220 is one mobile solution of Hisilicon, this patchset contains
initial support for Hi6220 SoC and HiKey development board, which
supports octal ARM Cortex A53 cores. Initial support is minimal and
includes just the arch configuration, device tree configuration, the
clock driver has been picked up by clock maintainers in clk tree.

PSCI is enabled in device tree and there is no problem to boot all the
octal cores, and the CPU hotplug is also working now, you can download
and compile the latest firmware based on the following link to run this
patch set:
https://github.com/96boards/documentation/wiki/UEFI

Chnages v9:
* Rebase to linus/master 4.1-rc1
* Remove the clock driver from this version because the clock maintainers
  have queued up the clock driver:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/clk/linux.git clk-next-hi6220
* This version also includes clock header file:
  [PATCH v9 6/6] dt-bindings: Add header file of hi6220 clock driver
  Although above patch is included in clock driver, I add to this series
  because the device tree file includes it, there will be compile error
  without it.
  At last, we just need to keep one when merged together.

Changes v6~v8:
This three versions only modified the clock drivers based on the
Stephen's review advices.
* clk-hi6220.c:
  ** Split the clock header file from clock driver
  ** Delete setting the parents clock of UART1 to HI6220_150M in clock
     driver, we can do that using assigned-clock in dts when enable
     UART1 in the future.
* clkdivider-hi6220.c: 
  ** Reuse some functions exported by clk-divider.c
  ** Remove "pr_err" and CLK_IS_BASIC flag
  ** Fix some programing style problems
* hisilicon/clk.h: remove the "__init" markings on some funcition
  prototypes.

Changes v5:
* Rebase to kernel 4.1-rc2
* Add compatible string "hisilicon,hi6220-pl011" for Hisilicon designed
  UART
* clk-hi6220.c: use __initdata for non-const arrays based on the commit
  692d8328e8c039f9497eb862c6cf835de922c061 

Changes v4:
* Rebase to kernel 4.1-rc1
* Delete "arm,cortex-a15-gic" from the gic node in dts 

Changes v3:
* Verified the CPU hotplug based on the new released firmware
* Redefined the compatible strings of four system controllers in dts 
* Setting COMMON_CLK_HI6220 to a bool symbol
* Keep CONFGI_ARCH_HISI sorted alphabetically

Changes v2:
* Split the DT bindings documents into earlier patches
* Change SMP enable method from spin-table to PSCI in device tree
* Remove "clock-frequency" from armv8-timer device node in device tree
* Add more description about Hisilicon designed system controllers
  in DT bindings document
* Enable high speed clock on UART1 mux
* Other changes based on the discussion in the mailing list:
