Some of the olimex series of boards feature a permanently connected eeprom on
i2c-1. This patch series adds them on all the boards that have them according
to the spec-sheets.

I explicitly added my personal --Tested-by to boards I actually tested. There
are two boards, that according to the sheets have them as well and physically
inspecting the boards shows them clearly, I did not actually test them on
those the boards that are missing the --Tested-by. So while it generally
should be safe to merge those patches as well, if someone with those boards
could add a --Tested-by that'd be great.

Additionally, it brings the eeprom on the OLinuXino a10s in line with the rest
and now follows the binding documentation.
