Try wm8731 I guess, something similar to the device, there's a lot of
variation in device complexity and several generations of hardware?  I'm
not sure what driver you were looking at here.

Paths.

An event callback is the way to go.  However please check what the
datasheet is actually trying to say - I suspect you will find it's
giving you a procedure that's got common elements for core power up and
then is saying something like "keep the outputs muted while you power
them up" but is doing it with lots of examples.

That seems much better.

This is what set_sysclk() is for, letting the driver know what the clock
rate is on the current board (if you are willing to go DT only you can
just use the clock API).

No, there's no way to do that.  Like I say I am somewhat mistrustful of
the clarity/accuracy of the hardware limitations being described here.
