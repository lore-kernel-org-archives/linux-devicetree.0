Yep, I will do that in next version.

Consumer could be any driver for the IP on the SOC, for example an 
ethernet driver which needs Mac Address from eeprom or an thermal sensor 
which requires cablibration values or an cpufreq driver which requires 
OPP settings. Am not sure who could be the consumer for serial number, I 
guess it should some soc specific driver.

I agree, the data layout is very specific to platform and could vary in 
complexity.
This simple framework is attempting to solve most common usecase where 
in the consumer drivers like thermal-sensor/network/cpufreq needs to 
read an location in the eeprom. Am sure we can find a way to accommodate 
the complex layout as well.

There are pros and cons doing it as list of keys.

One reason for doing it as fixed properties("eeproms", "eemprom-names") 
is "consistency and familiarity" like interrupts, regs, dmas, clocks, 
pinctrl, reset, pwm have fixed property names, trying to get most 
subsystems to do it the same way makes it easier for people to write dts 
files.
