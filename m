I see, this is plain wrong. Will replace that with a select ... if MMU
in multiplatform.

I did some research at RFC/v1 time and mainly looked into Arnd's git
trees. Most patches just open up !MMU for multiplatform. What I'm trying
to do here is to enable !MMU with multiplatform while keeping the impact
as little as possible, e.g. by making all other platforms in
multiplatform dependent on MMU.

Also looked at some other messages about this topic, but I guess quotes
from the message above will do to discuss this further:

The platforms I primarily have in mind (heterogeneous multi-processing
SoC's with MMU/!MMU processors) would actually allow such a
multiplatform kernel: i.MX6 SoloX as well as Vybrid have the main memory
in the same location, hence one could build a multiplatform !MMU kernel
for this two devices. Of course, this is possible more by chance. I also
did not tried it yet. I don't have a i.MX6 SoloX device.

I must admit that this was the main motivation for me too. My first
approach was to create a set of completely independent config symbols:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=141756604900611&w=2

However, I'm sure this could be done better and with less config
symbols.

So, if you think it would be worth enabling multiplatform for these
devices (Vybrid/i.MX6 SoloX), I would prepare a patchset which does it
while not converting EFM32 to multiplatform (as patch 08/11 currently
does).

If you think it's also not worth for those devices, I will try to enable
ARCH_MXC/SOC_VF610 with !MMU and !MULTIPLATFORM...
