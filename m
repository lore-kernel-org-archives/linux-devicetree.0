Kind of - it worked with a non-upstream patch against the sky2 driver
which used the dt alias of 'sky2' to get to its mac address.  I've
since learned how to reference PCI dt nodes properly and have patched
the sky2 driver the proper way (see
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git/commit/drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/sky2.c?id=3ee2f8ce1ab8f235bda164295fa0cf39ec1c2400).
 So now, I'm 'fixing' the improper way I did it before.

I'm not sure where its 'best' documented, but it is the way the kernel works.

I'm cc'ing Jason as some of his comments to another thread helped me
understand how to define a PCI device node off a bus in dt properly -
perhaps he knows where its best documented.

I was hoping there was a way to reference PCI nodes by BDF values as
I'm simply trying to define a marvell,sky2 device at 08:00.0.  I found
that the kernel's OF parsing code for PCI requires you to nest the
nodes to match the bus hierarchy.  In order to map a dt node to a PCI
device, the bus the device is on must have a dt node itself, which is
what creates the need for the nesting.  Note that the bus topology
here rc -> P2P bridge -> GigE.
