Just to be clear, if you must have such a property it should come from
the _controller_ node.

However at one point you said,  "Only the A9 (Mbox 0) can Rx."
  Which sounds like the 'simplex' constraint is not coming from the
mailbox controller but from the remote endpoints that don't RX+TX
except for one of them. That makes more sense than a controller with
differently capable physical channels. If that is indeed the
situation, then the controller is actually 'duplex' and there should
be no tx-only/rx-only property anywhere. Everything automatically
falls into place because client drivers are written for specific
targets and, unless you write some code, there can be no TX call to a
remote that doesn't listen.

No, such races are a practical problem. We must own them.

I was talking about problems that arise because someone wrote bad
DT... those are not 'practical' problems because there are too many
ways to screw up with bad DT properties that if we try to check for
them we'll go insane.

I am aware of that. I said expose _only_ physical channels, not _all_ :)
