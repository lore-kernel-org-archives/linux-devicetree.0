I have got very limited access to documentation, which obviously does 
not have any info related to channel capabilities. I was thinking that 
all the playback ports support multi-channel. I might be wrong though.

This naming is very specific to the SBC board.

   I will check the spec to see if the QUAT

External HDMI bridge on the other side only supports 2-channels, but if 
you can re-check on the channel capabilities would be good.
