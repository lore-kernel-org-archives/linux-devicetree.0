This series came about after Mark Rutland brought up the fact that the current
FDT placement logic used by the EFI stub is flawed. But actually, it turned out
that the documentation for both the Image and FDT placement was incorrect as
well, or confusing at the very least.

So this series does two things:
- It relaxes the FDT placement requirements, and updates the documentation and
  EFI stub FDT placement logic accordingly.
- It clarifies the Image placement requirements in the documentation, and brings
  the EFI stub Image placement logic in line with it

Changes since v1:
- patch #1: split off reservation of the FDT binary itself from the memreserve
  processing, since the former assumes the FDT is accessed via the linear
  mapping, which we are about to change
- patch #2: mention the older, stricter FDT placement rules in booting.txt,
  get rid of early_print,
  use correct format specifier for phys_addr_t,
  use R/O mapping for FDT,
- patches #3 .. #5: add R-b, minor style and grammar tweaks 
  
Ard Biesheuvel (5):
  of/fdt: split off FDT self reservation from memreserve processing
  arm64: use fixmap region for permanent FDT mapping
  arm64: Documentation: clarify Image placement in physical RAM
  arm64/efi: ensure that Image does not cross a 512 MB boundary
  arm64/efi: adapt to relaxed FDT placement requirements
