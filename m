Hi,

The following v2 of the series provides a base driver for the support
of TI's message manager hardware block which facilitates communication
between multiple compute engines(or processors) with a central system
controller (called PMMC in K2G SoC). Keystone family of TI processors
incorporate this solution starting with K2G[1].

The hardware specification is available here:
http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruhy8/spruhy8.pdf Chapter 8.1 (Message
Manager - NOTE: complete chapter update is estimated to be around
March '16).

Starting with K2G SoC, TI Keystone architecture is moving towards an
architecture similar to ARM Juno platform with a centralized system
controller where all system control takes place - all power management
and system control functions are now centralized in this system
controller. A protocol called TI-SCI (TI System Control Interface)
is built on top of this mailbox driver providing for communication
protocol (similar to SCPI drivers/firmware/arm_scpi.c) Follow on
patches (once the message manager is accepted) will enable the same.
However, an 4.1 kernel based vendor kernel implementation is available
at [2].

The following series is functional in TI vendor kernel, however, was
tested on K2G EVM using the following test fragment:
http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/15209502/

Boot log: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/15209436/

baseline: v4.5-rc1

Changes since v1:
	- dt binding has been majorly upgraded
	- driver updates for the bindings
v1: http://marc.info/?l=devicetree&m=145469015018996&w=2
