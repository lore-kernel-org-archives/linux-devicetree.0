Some were still helpful (especially the idea to use the chan_init
function for setting the irq), thanks.

Aren't they necessary for the DMA engine core?

How I understand this DMA controller:
There are 16 DMA channels in the DMA controller, but only 13 interrupts
are available at the IRQ controller. Therefore, the upper DMA channels
can just not be used. Maybe because there are to many other IRQs and
they didn't want to implement another IRQ bank.
Furthermore, some of the DMA channels are already used by the
VideoCore/GPU/firmware. This is what dma-channel-mask indicates. This
should be automatically set by the firmware in the future.
Finally, there are some channels with special functionality that should
not be used by DMA engine, too. Therefore, these lines:
		/* do not use the FIQ and BULK channels */
		chans_available &= ~0xD;

I would like to maintain the possibility for board file based
instatiation, because the Raspberry Pi downstream kernel still doesn't
support device tree. If this is a no-go, I will accept that.
