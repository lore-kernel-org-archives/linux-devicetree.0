commit ae8c4209af2cec065fef15d200a42a04130799f7
Author: Stephen Warren <swarren@nvidia.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 19 15:34:43 2012 -0700

    of: Add vendor prefix for Asahi Kasei Corp.

    Their stock ticker is 3407.T which wouldn't make a good DT vendor
    prefix. Use the company name initials instead.
