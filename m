I use the Quad/Dual (not Lite) manual for reference, most of it is
identical.. I keep forgetting there is another one, sorry.

It's at the top of the GPIO section, though (figure 29-1 in your manual).

Just to clarify: set or clear? It should be clear if the PHY provides
the clock to the MAC, and set if the MAC provides the clock to the
PHY. There can be only one, Highlander!

Hmm.. this might be a touch low, but it's not the issue here. The way
I recall this working, the IP has a clock (IPG, AHB as above) and
there is a MAC clock too which you're generating from DIV_SELECT in
the ENET_PLL. They don't have to be the same..

Which definitely implies the clock is input to the MAC...

If the GPR1 bit isn't set right what you're getting is different
clocks when they should be sharing the same one... extra edges from
the internal ref clock (from ENET_PLL by default) might add a couple
extra bytes here and there if the PHY sends on edges it's clock and
the MAC receives on edges on the internal clock.

In 3.12-ish I see mach-imx/mach-imx6q.c:imx6q_1588_init() is setting
the bit, which means the reference clock is coming from
ENET_PLL[DIV_SELECT] and not the pad.

If you set it to 1, it sets pad loopback which means you'd output a
125MHz clock towards a pad you marked as input to the i.MX6 - the
IOMUX block will twiddle some internal flops from clock -> output
block but since it's not hooked to the pad, nothing will come of it.
But the MAC will use it to latch data over MDIO.

None of the boards in the tree right now seem to use an external PHY
clock at all, which is why they all work; they provide the PHY clock
from the i.MX6Q to an RGMII PHY (this is the lowest power way to do
it!).

This is wrong for you... but I have seen a couple that do it this way.
There was some terrible confusion with older MX6 tapeouts where this
bit wasn't documented and using RMII was a complete afterthought...
the manual reflects it now but I am fairly sure there is a quirk that
needs addressing.

In theory the i.MX6SL EVK has RMII but I am also fairly sure the
SoloLite doesn't have the option to use anything but RMII and either
fortuitous software or chicken-bit-does-nothing-here design is helping
it out.

I'm gonna go look at the manual some more.. for reference, this is
also a great design guide - IMX6QD6SDLHDG.pdf (it's on the same site
as you got the RM). Chapter 12 is comprehensive in it's discussion of
i.MX6QD[L] and RMII ethernet evil.

Does anyone at Freescale want to donate a SabreSD for Dual or Quad
(not-lite) and an i.MX6SL EVK this way? I may be able to scrounge up a
couple CuBox-i units but I think supporting the reference designs is
worth doing. Also I kind of want/need JTAG access and I am sure
SolidRun didn't even go so far as putting pads on the PCB...
