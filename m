The way we deal with this in other bindings is that we tie such
requirements to the compatible; i.e. we would say that qcom,qca6174-bt
requires a clock and we would have something like qcom,qca-bt that makes
it optional.

The beauty of this is that the driver will tell you if you forgot to
specify the clock when it actually is required, which saves you
considerable amount of debugging time.


NB. The way the bcm driver handles this is insufficient, as it treats
any error from clk_get as "there's no clock specified". The driver
should accept a clock not being specified, but should fail properly when
a clock is specified but can't be acquired (e.g. due to clk_get()
returning EPROBE_DEFER).

This is completely generic and only relates to getting the electrical
properties of the gpio pin set up correctly. So I would recommend that
we omit this from the binding and example (including the pinctrl
properties for the serial above).
