Yes, revert the "Remove parts that were picoxcell-specific". My 2
patches were not based on your tree, so I don't think they can be
applied there. It was based on the arm-soc with the 4 patches in it.

The 4 patches are fine in arm-soc. But I'll let Arnd, Olof and yourself
decide on what's best. I just know that Pavel's patch will conflict with
the 4 that are in arm-soc.
