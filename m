Nor the guest's, TBH. How do host and guest communicate, what is the
infrastructure, how is it meant to be used? A lot of questions, and no
answer whatsoever in this series.

Well, this looks so far like a code dumping exercise. I'd very much
appreciate a HIDMA101 crash course:

- How do host and guest communicate?
- How is the integration performed in the hypervisor?
- Does the HYP side requires any context switch (and how is that done)?
- What makes it safe?

Without any of this information (and pointer to the code to back it up),
I'm very reluctant to take any of this.

Thanks,
