Before porting that patch I was looking to implementation of the EDAC 
for L2 cache and tried to use the framework. Sorry, but I couldn't 
understand why would the Keystone platform may need it. Most likely 
because I didn't understand the framework itself :(

In order the Keystone ECC works u-boot has to initialize the entire DDR3 
and enable ECC. When kernel boots up it has to install the ECC interrupt 
handlers for Cortex-A15 L1/L2 ECC and Keystone2 DDR3 ECC. As far as 
1-bit errors handled and corrected by hardware the software even doesn't 
need to handle those errors. We need to handle 2-bit errors and just 
reboot the board.

As the ECC detection has to be enable on kernel boot time and cannot be 
disabled there is not sense to make it in a module.

So, shall Keystone use the EDAC framework to install the onetime working 
interrupt handler? What are advantages to use the framework?

I appreciate your opinion.

Thanks,
Vitaly
