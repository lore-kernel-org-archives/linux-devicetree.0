I think I just kept the alias similar to the clock-name. The naming of the 
dma-controllers seems to be inconsistent ... the clocks are named dmac1 and 
dmac2, while the interrupt table in the rk3188-TRM calls them dmac0 and dmac1. 
So I guess I just duplicated the naming for the rk3288.

I guess for the rk3288, the one at 0xffb20000 should be named something like 
dmac_bus and the other one dmac_peri, reflecting what they're called in the 
TRM, but I'm of course open for suggestions :-) .


Also for an upcoming v2, I've also changed the structure a bit, as the first 
dma-controller has both a secure and non-secure version of it.
So currently the rk3288.dtsi looks like [0]:

	amba {
		compatible = "arm,amba-bus";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		/* dma1 in secure state */
		dma-controller@ffb20000 {
			compatible = "arm,pl330", "arm,primecell";
			reg = <0xffb20000 0x4000>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			#dma-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&cru ACLK_DMAC1>;
			clock-names = "apb_pclk";
			status = "disabled";
		};

		/* dma1 in non-secure state */
		dma-controller@ffb60000 {
			compatible = "arm,pl330", "arm,primecell";
			reg = <0xffb60000 0x4000>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 1 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			#dma-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&cru ACLK_DMAC1>;
			clock-names = "apb_pclk";
			status = "disabled";
		};

		dmac2: dma-controller@ff250000 {
			compatible = "arm,pl330", "arm,primecell";
			reg = <0xff250000 0x4000>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 2 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
				     <GIC_SPI 3 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			#dma-cells = <1>;
			clocks = <&cru ACLK_DMAC2>;
			clock-names = "apb_pclk";
		};
	};

and the board is responsible for enabling the correct variant [1], as most 
likely the bootloader decides in which mode to start the dma controller:

	amba {
		/* dma1 in secure state */
		dmac1: dma-controller@ffb20000 {
			status = "okay";
		};
	};

This is based on some mailinglist discussion, I found at some point, about 
this but for the life of me am not able to find anymore. So of course feedback 
would appreciated there too.

correct :-)
