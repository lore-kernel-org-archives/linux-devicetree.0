Ok, I will fix it.

Indeed.  I forgot killing this "two integers array" thing while I was
updating the document to expands PIN_FUNC_ID as <mux_reg conf_reg
input_reg mux_val input_val>.

Ok.

They are documented in fsl,imx-pinctrl.txt.

These numbers have been taken care of by the macros in imx*-pinfunc.h.
You only need to find the corresponding macro for it from the header.

The CONFIG number has nothing to do with imx*-pinfunc.h.  You will need
to translate the setting here into the last number of fsl,pins entry.

Yes, will do.
