Sure!

clk_prepare_enabled will *enable* the clock signal if it currently
disabled or gated. In other words, if the physical line is not toggling
before the call, it will be after the call returns.

Having a positive enable_count will prevent the clock from being
disabled by both clk_disable_unused AND from the Sneaky Sibling
Attack(tm).

The Sneaky Sibling Attack(tm) occurs when clock A and clock B are
siblings and share the same parent, clock C. If clock A is enabled in
hardware (by bootloader, firmware or hypervisor), but does NOT have a
positive enable_count (in Linux), then it is possible that a driver
might call clk_enable(clk_B) then clk_disable(clk_B), which will result
in the disable action propagating up the parent chain and disabling
clk_C, the shared parent. This will of course gate clk_A, which is
clocked by clk_C, breaking things for you.

So you need to be worried about more than just clk_disable_unused.

The simple fact is is that if a piece of software knows that it needs
for its clock to be enabled, it should actively enable it with
clk_prepare_enable.

Doing some weird stuff with CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED or anything else is just
hoping that your clock will not be disabled, and that is the wrong
strategy.

Well, you should not "try to prevent a clock from being disabled", you
should "enable the clock that you need to use".

Right, the flags are immutable and must be set by the clock provider
driver before registering the clock. Toggling flags at run-time is a
misuse of the flags, and clock consumer drivers should never care about
the flags. They are internal to the clock framework.

In conclusion, I think that your patch does the right thing. The Xen
node consumes the clocks that it needs to manage and it calls
clk_prepare_enable on them. The two issues to resolve are:

1) does consuming these hardware resources from the Linux kernel fit
correctly with the Xen model?
2) the language of the binding description makes this way more confusing
than it needs to be. Just claim the resources you need and enable them,
which is an OS-agnostic action.
