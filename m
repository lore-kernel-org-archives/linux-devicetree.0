By "multiple device nodes", I assume you mean device tree nodes? I'm not
sure I like the sound of that.

I believe that DT should represent the structure of the HW in terms of
HW modules or blocks. If there's a single cohesive HW module that
happens to talk to multiple MMUs, or indeed has any kind of unusual case
at all, I don't think that should force the DT representation to be
broken up into multiple nodes. We should have a DT node for that HW
module, and it should be up to the device driver to make the internal SW
representation work correctly.
