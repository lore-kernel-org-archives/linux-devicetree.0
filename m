That implies there are more mailboxes. I wonder if we should
parameterize which to use via some DT properties? I guess we can defer
that though; we can default to the current values and add properties
later if we want to use something else.

I know the PDF mentioned in the comment earlier in the patch says to put
in barriers between accesses to different peripherals, which this seems
compliant with, but I don't see quite what this barrier achieves. I
think the PDF is talking generalities, not imposing a rule that must be
blindly followed. Besides, if there's a context-switch you can't
actually implement the rules the PDF suggests. What read operation is
this barrier attempting to ensure happens after reading all mailbox
messages and any associated DRAM buffer?

If any barrier is needed, shouldn't it be between the mailbox read and
the processing of that message (which could at least in some cases read
an SDRAM buffer). So, the producer would do roughly:

p1) Fill in DRAM buffer
p2) Write memory barrier so the MBOX write happens after the above
p3) Send mbox message to tell the consumer to process the buffer

... and the consumer:

c1) Read MBOX register to know which DRAM buffer to handle
c2) rmb() to make sure we read from the DRAM buffer after the MBOX read
c3) Read the DRAM buffer

Even then, since (c3) is data-dependent on (c1), I don't think the rmb()
in (c2) there actually does anything useful.

Is it safe to read chan->started without the channel lock held?

This also doesn't seem useful?

This one I agree with, at least if MBOX messages contain pointers to
DRAM buffers.

Don't we need to hold chan->lock when adjusting chan->started? Or is
start/stop intended to be asynchronous to any operations currently in
progress on the channel?

That barrier doesn't seem useful?

What are the semantics of "tx done"? This seems to be testing that the
TX mailbox isn't completely full, which is more about whether the
consumer side is backed up rather than whether our producer-side TX
operations are done.

If the idea is to wait for the consumer to have consumed everything in
our TX direction, shouldn't this check for empty not !full?

I expect devm_request_irq() checkes that condition.

Printing ret might be useful to know why.

Are you sure devm_request_irq() is appropriate? The IRQ handler will be
unregistered *after* bcm2835_mbox_remove() is called, and I think
without any guarantee re: the order that other devm_ allocations are
cleaned up. If bcm2835_mbox_remove() can't guarantee that no IRQ will
fire after it exits, then bcm2835_mbox_irq() might just get called after
some allocations are torn down, thus causing the IRQ handler to touch
free'd memory.

Both request_mailbox_iomem and request_mailbox_irq are small enough
they're typically written inline into the main probe() function.

devm_kzalloc() already prints an error, so no need to add another here,
even if it does nicely document the fact that you remembered error
messages:-)

It'd be common to say "sizeof(*mbox->controller.chans) so the type can't
mismatch what's being assigned to.

Same comment about error messages here.

There's no interrupt for "TX space available"? Oh well. I guess that's
why mbox->controller.txdone_poll = true.
