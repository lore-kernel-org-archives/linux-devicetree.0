No, it's the functionally that is most convenient.

You can say that with any of the clocks on this platform.

None of the boot loaders we use do this.

I have never seen the STFE clock crash a platform.

Right, but their clocks can not be turned off, ever.  So all the boxes
are ticked for criticalness.  Not the case with your clock.

The scope was narrowed intentionally, buy the maintainers.  I am
merely reflecting their views.  If you really wish to contend these,
you should take it up with them.

Okay SoC specific.  Is there a SoC specific clock driver?

This still stands.

If they are many and various, we can discuss alternative solutions.

Then the variable would have to be exported.

Right, see above.

Probably best to take your special use-case up with the Clock
Maintainers.  As the author of the critical-clocks patch-set, I would
say that your use-case does not tick all the boxes for use of the
critical-clock mechanism, but at the end of the day, it really isn't
my train-set.
