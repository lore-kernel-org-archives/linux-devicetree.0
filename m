Is there an exhaustive list of available buses (on the ARM platform)
and an overview of when/where each one is appropriate?

I know nothing about DT (aside from the Wikipedia entry).
I'll take a closer look at Documentation/devicetree.
Will that explain what platform/... is?

I see a drivers/platform folder, but nothing ARM-specific there?

Hmmm, color me even more confused. I had really come to believe that
driver registration was a mandatory part of the driver, something
that wasn't left to "infrastructure code".

Please excuse my naive question: what are platform drivers, and where
are they stored in the kernel source tree?

Regards.
