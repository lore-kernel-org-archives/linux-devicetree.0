The DT should just describe how the h/w is hooked-up. What the s/w has
to do based on that is the driver's problem which is certainly
vendor/chip specific, but that is all irrelevant to the binding.

Yes.

Then that should be the default with no properties.

I imagine for phones, vendors want I2S hooked up for voice calls so
audio can be routed directly to/from the modem and the power hungry
apps processor can be kept in low power modes.

Bindings are for h/w description (and config to some extent).

Ah, NM, I missed the wrapper.
