The same solution applies to both: don't describe the memory in the
first place. Don't place it in a memory node, and don't give it
attributes allowing it to be mapped and used in the UEFI memory map.

I do not disagree with this point generally, but it's irrelevant to the
point at hand.

This doesn't follow. If you want to pointlessly change things, you will
encounter pain. That's not an argument for hacking a partial solution
into the DT and ignoring the problems this causes.

As I tried to ask earlier, how is the mailbox memory used? Does the
kernel configure the address in the hardware, or is this pre-configured?
Could the kernel choose a region of memory to use dynamically?

The code might be there, but UEFI can make use of any memory it knows
about for stacks, pool allocations and so on. It needs to be prevented
from using the mailbox memory.

I am well aware of how this works. Please re-read my replies, this is
not the issue I describe.

This is simply not true. If UEFI (or any UEFI application) mapped the
memory as cacheable in the past, you need to perform cache maintenance
to get rid of any stale (dirty) cachelines.

This is one of the reasons that the UEFI memory map needs to not
describe the memory as being available to be mapped and used, and why
having a reserved-memory node is insufficient.

The issue is that the region you describe in reserved-memory also falls
within an existing region in a memory node (or the UEFI memory map).

The no-map forces a memblock_remove after the memory was added to
memblock, but before it was mapped. This ensures Linux won't map the
memory. This does not ensure that UEFI or UEFI application will not map,
reserve, or use the memory for their own purposes.

Unfortunately this is insufficient. This leaves a slew of problems when
using UEFI, and given that, it's not a common solution.

Using reserved-memory in this case only gives a semblance of
correctness, but doesn't mean you are doing the right thing.

If the memory is not in the memory nodes nor the UEFI memory map, there
is no need for a reserved-memory entry. If it exists in the UEFI memory
map, the reserved-memory entry is insufficient for the reasons I have
stated previously.

Likewise for the MCU firmware memory.
