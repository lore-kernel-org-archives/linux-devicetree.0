Hi Sudeep,

Thanks for your comments.

The IPI hardware block has both buffers and registers. The hardware
block has dedicated
buffers for each mailboxes, and thus, in the implementation, we directly access
the buffers from IPI driver. However, the controller registers are
shared between
mailboxes in the hardware, as the ATF will also access the registers,
we need to use
SMC/HVC to access the registers (control or ISR). And the SMC/HVC here is for
the register access.

I am not clear on smc/hvc based mailbox is used for tx, and hardware
based is used
for  "rx". As for both TX and RX, we need to write/read the registers
(through SMC) and
write/read the buffers provided by the IPI hardware block directly.

Thanks,
Wendy
