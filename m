hi, Mark

Thanks very much for your review. I appreiciate your professional
suggestions and comments.

In order to make it clear, i need describe the HW fist.

There are several timer controllers, and we call each one as "timer". Each timer
has its own register space.
A timer will have 3 counters, and each counter can be seperately
disabled/enabled.
Each counter has 3 match registers. Any match of the three matches
will generate the same
interrupt.
>From the timer controller, each counter will export its own interrupt
siginal out of the controller,
but before it is connected to interrupt chip, SOC designer may combine them.

There is a silicon requirment for the timer reading.
Every time read the count, there will be a delay, or you may read a
part of the counter.
So we repeatly read the counter until two reads are same.

There is a slicon requirment for the timer setting
When we set match registers, we need disable the counter first, then
set the match register,
after that enable the counter. Disabling and re-enabling the counter
will make the counter
restart from 0.

There are two clock inputs: fastclk and 32K. fastclk will be 3.25M,
6.5M or somehing else.
Fastclk can not work if the system goes to some deep idle states.
These deep idle states: core subsystem shutdown and some clock unit will
shutdown.
We make use of these deep idle states as part of CPU idle states to
save more power.
For these power states, only 32K clock can work.

So you have questions about the DT settings
1. "marvell,timer-fastclk-frequency" marvell,timer-apb-frequency
You suggest to use  the clock bindings:

       clocks = <&apb_plck>, <&clock_controller 0 3>;
       clock-names = "apb_pclk", "fastclk";
I agree with you. The problem is now mach-mmp CLOCK DT support just starts.
I am afraid in this patch set, i can not do like this, but i am sure i
can change it
after clock DT support is done.

2. "marvell,timer-id" "marvlll,timer-counter-id"
The "marvell,timer-id" i think is not needed, because i do not need to know
the index of the timer. ALL the timer are same to me.
I need "marvell,timer-counter-id" because i need distinuish it when
set the registers

3. "marvell,timer-counter-rating"
I agree with you. It need to be fix in the code not exported in DT file.

4. "marvell,timer-counter-clkevt", "marvell,timer-counter-clksrc",
marvell,timer-counter-delay
For UP SOC, it need at least 1 clksrc and 1 clockevent device

For SMP SOC with arch timer, it need at least 1 clksrc, 1 clockevent
device for broadcast, 1 delay timer
The reason for needing delay timer: It will be running at fastclk to
achieve more accurate delay. clksrc need to be
 set 32K or i will lose the count if system goes to deep idle.
The reason for needing broadcast clkevt: arch timer will not work if
core subsystem is down, i will make them switch to
broadcast timer, so timer can still wake up cores out of idle.

For SMP SOC without arch timer, it only happens for some early version
of SOCes. except the clock devices
needed buy SMP SOC, we create the per cpu clock event device to
replace the arch timer.

So i still do not understand your suggestions "Why can you not just
describe the set of timers available to Linux and
allow it to allocate them as required?"
Can you describe it more clear?

5. marvell,timer-counter-nodynirq
The reason is couple idle.
The couple idle implementation implies that CPU0 will be first core wake up.
So, we can not have CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_DYNIRQ because it may make CPU1 to
be first core wake up.
