Yes, that would have been better, I didn't know that existed...
After this point we can find per-cpu variables easily, they just need mapping to
HYP.

This pointer is just for the panic message, I'm not sure how useful it is.
For kdump the kvm_arm_running_vcpu array holds the same information, so is
printing this out just so we can spot if its totally-bogus?


As your fine with this for now, I'll put tidying it up on my todo list...
