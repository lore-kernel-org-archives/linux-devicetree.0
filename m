Yes, I found this on a couple of more places and fixed them all.

There is currently no need for reg property, so let me replace this with:

CPU_PD0: cpu-pd0

This follows existing bindings for power-domains as per
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt. I guess it's
better to stick to that!?

Each node represents a power domain, which contains devices (in this
case CPUs) that are specific to each power domain.

In other words, we are trying to describe the HW using a hierarchical layout.
