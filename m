Yes, the request source id is defined in the data sheet.
each eDMA controller has two muxes, some SoCs have two eDMA controllers
while others have only one. The 1st eDMA's muxes are named mux0 and mux1,
while the 2nd eDMA controller's muxes are named MUX2 and MUX3 in the datasheet,
and I index them in each eDMA controller from 0 in the driver to handle them commonly.
I defines the macro tending to give the info from the macro name, such as
for the VF610_EDMA0_MUX0_SAI2_TX request source, implying the eDMA engine id 0,
and the mux id should be 0. While VF610_EDMA1_MUX1_FTM0_CH0 implying eDMA engine id 1,
mux 1. The request sources are shared between the two eDMA controller but need the user
to select one manually when reference.
I think this could ease the dma reference for the eDMA controller, or I will remove them.
Thanks!

[Lu Jingchang-b35083] 
Yes, these definitions are highly depending on the arm32 arch. This device is only
integrated in our arm32 SoCs currently, so I have only considered arm32.
In arm32, it seems that the ioread32 and readl are the same in arm32,
I will try your recommendation below to simplify the caller.
Thanks.

The values written in fsl_edma_set_tcd_params() are pre-swapped in fill_tcd_params().
The eDMA support hardware SGs, but the eDMA engine's sg format is required the same as
the eDMA Controller's endian, so the SGs in memory to be loaded automatically by the eDMA 
engine also required swapped properly. So they should be swapped specifically here.
Thanks.

The binding in DTS is to the eDMA engine, and the binding indicates the eDMA node
(by <&edma0 ...>), the dma engine framework would find the proper eDMA engine device
referenced in dts. This driver only supports dts reference, so I think the dma engine
framework could guarantee the eDMA instance properly in of_dma_find_controller().
Thanks.
