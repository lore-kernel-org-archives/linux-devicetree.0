My comment was going to be along the same lines. It is an optional
parameter, which is what I would expect for a firmware-specific type of
property.

I also don't agree that this is "copying that bug to ACPI". This line of
code has no impact to ACPI. No ACPI implementation should add this,
certainly not if it was actually tested as it would not run if it was
present in the _DSD. So... what's the problem exactly? Or perhaps more
specifically:

Mark, what would you propose we do differently to enable this driver to
be firmware-type agnostic?
