There is already a binding for ESP8089, which is supported out of tree.
There are also bindings for Mali GPUs which are, again, supported out
of tree.

AFAIK there was some discussion about this during the submission of the
Mali bindings. A set of stable bindings allows the vendor to create stable
device trees. Given that the binding for this WiFi chip is relatively simple,
and it might be compatible or similar to an existing chip already supported
in kernel (but without a binding), it should be straight forward.

So it doesn't support in-band SDIO interrupts right now. Is that a hardware
or driver limitation?
