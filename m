Yes something like that is probably needed.

Alternatively (I didn't try if this works) we could do it so that
when we see:

	gpio = devm_gpiod_get_index(&pdev->dev, "shutdown", 1);

we check first for the property ("shutdown-gpios"), and check if it has
more than one entry in the value, like:

	Package () { "reset-gpios", Package () { ^GPIO, 0, 0, 0, ^GPIO, 1, 0, 0}}

and in that case return the second entry. If we find this instead:

	Package () { "reset-gpios", Package () { ^GPIO, 0, 0, 0 }}

we just ignore the index.

Last if there is no _DSD the index refers directly to the GPIO resource
in _CRS.

This would support both _DSD and non-_DSD at the same time but it makes
the implementation more complex.
