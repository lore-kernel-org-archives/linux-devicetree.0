This doesn't sound to different from any of the other supported audio DSPs. 
ALSA seems to have 95% of what you need. And the missing 5% is probably 
stuff that is not specific to your hardware but rather something that other 
hardware will need as well. The framework is not set in stone you can make 
modifications and add the features that are missing to make your hardware work.

E.g. look at sound/soc/intel/ for an example of a audio DSP.

No integrating this into ALSA will quite likely result in a quite messy 
situation for you on the long run.
