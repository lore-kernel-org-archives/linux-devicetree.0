I would not get any console output progress around the time we
initialize the MMU (roughly), neither would I get an exception since
that is too early in the boot process.

I think you are right, I was in the 3rd case where accessing the UART
using its virtual address would make the system. Reading through
devicemaps_init(), defining a custom map_io() functions means you are
in control and you explicitely need to call debug_ll_io_init(), which
I was not doing when I removed my custom map_io() implementation.

Thanks!
