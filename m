I'm not 100% sure what you mean. Given this and other comments on
TEE_IOC_CMD, I give up on TEE_IOC_CMD. I'll replace it with several more
specific TEE_IOC_* that will give a less complex and unified interface
to user space.

Each client opens a the same /dev/teeX and communicates over their own file
descriptor.

For OP-TEE (and I guess most other TEEs) it handles file system access.
Having a separate user for tee-supplicant makes it easier to have strict
permissions for created files etc.

Defining all those bits for OPTEE_SMC_SHM_CACHED didn't help much. I
took the liberty to contact Catalin directly on this and my
interpretation of his advice is:

/*
 * Normal cached memory (write-back), shareable for SMP systems and not
 * shareable for UP systems.
 */
#define OPTEE_SMC_SHM_CACHED            1

This is closer to my original proposal, but with the crucial difference
that OP-TEE doesn't need to know how the kernel maps other memory.
OP-TEE requires the kernel to map memory shared with secure world with
the attributes specified in the comment.
