This will get rather complex too though, because most codec and cpu dais 
can act as clock source xor clock consumer, depending on how the 
hardware is built. Would you want to represent everything, bit clocks, 
frame clocks, master clocks etc as clock nodes?

If that's the case, could you depict how the DT bindings should look 
like by example?


Thanks,
Daniel
