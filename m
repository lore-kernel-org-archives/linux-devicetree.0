Probably.

Since this appears to be about an ARM SoC according to your To list, in
general, you create a device tree binding, that binding is registered
within your platform/... driver code and referenced in the device tree
for SoC or board, and then your driver will automatically be probed.

Most likely you do not need to call either yourself.

Just compare other platform drivers on the one hand, and temparature
sensor drivers on the other (such as I2C based gmt,g781 / LM90).
Did you already check whether there is a driver that is both?

Andreas
