This patch set fixes the following issues that were reported during regression.

Patch 1/2: Disables 10GbE and SGMII based 1GbE by default for backward
	   compatiblity with older firmware (<= 1.13.28).  Newer firmware
	   will enable these interfaces based on its configuration.
Patch 2/2: Use separate hardware resources (descriptor ring, prefetch buffer)
	   that are not shared with the firmware
