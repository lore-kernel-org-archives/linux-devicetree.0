There's existing device tree code for PowerPC which seems to figure this
out by doing a DT lookup in the machine driver which appears to be sane
enough.  If we can't look up a struct device via the device tree we'd
seem to have a fairly serious problem as struct devices are how we talk
about devices at runtime in general.

To be honest I've not paid too much attention to the device tree code
people are currently using since discussion around it has always
involved repeatedly going over all the reasons why we actually need
machine drivers and that gets tedious after a while.

This isn't a scalability thing and it's not related to binding, it's
because the AUXMUX isn't properly represented as a driver.  It probably
wants to be moved over to use the soc-dsp stuff Liam's doing at the
minute.  Currently we don't tell the core about the AUDMUX at all so
it's unreasonable to expect it to do anything except a static route.
