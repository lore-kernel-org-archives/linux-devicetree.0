Just using the binding seems fine to me.

No, you can't select ARM_LPAE because that would break machines that
do not support it in the same configuration.

Losing half the RAM or PCI should not be a problem, you'd just run
with reduced functionality. You wouldn't want to do that in practice,
but it's different from a hard dependency.

Hmm, that seems like a hole in the API. Maybe you can come up with
a solution for it that doesn't take too much effort. It seems the
way that MCPM was integrated is suboptimal. We don't have too many
users yet, can you try turning the logic for MCPM around so it fits
the CPU_METHOD_OF_DECLARE()?

Then for now put them into one local structure and pass around the
pointer where you can but access the local one where it's too early.

The effect will be the same, but it's easier to grasp by someone
who is used to reading regular device drivers. Also add a comment
in front of the data structure explaining the reasons for having
a static copy.

I don't think the mailbox framework should allow that much
flexibility, because that would break portable drivers that
rely on a particular behavior from the mailbox provider.

I understand that your driver is not portable to another mailbox
provider, but it still seems like a mistake in the API that should
better be fixed sooner than later.

Do you know how long it takes normally? If you can prove that the
reply normally comes within a few microseconds, you can instead call
WARN_ON() once after too much time passes, and then continue polling.

The case to avoid here is just accidentally polling for multiple
milliseconds with interrupts disabled, which would cause a lot of
problems.

That would be '__packed __attribute__((aligned(4)))'. A struct of 'u32'
already has no padding on any architecture that is supported by Linux.
The only reason you need the packing here is because the u64 member is
unaligned. Note that marking the entire structure as packed means that
accesses are no longer atomic because the compiler may prefer to do them
one byte at a time, which can break the protocol on the shared memory
area.
