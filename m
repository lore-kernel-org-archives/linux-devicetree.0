No reason, only a type, indeed it was lower-casing on the v1.
Will fix in v2.

The GXL and GXM differences are very small :
 - They share the same clock tree
 - They share the same pinctrl and even the same pinout (S905D and S912 are=
 pin-to-pin compatible)
 - They share all the peripherals

The only changes are :
 - Enhanced video encoding and decoding support, this will need a family-sp=
ecific compatible when pushed
 - Slightly differences in the Video Processing Unit, this is why I introdu=
ced family-specific compatibles
 - A secondary Cortex-A53 cluster
 - A secondary SCPI cpufreq clock entry
 - A different Mali core, but with the same interrupts (less but they share=
 the same lower interrupts), clocks and memory space

This is why it was decided to have a sub-dtsi, having a secondary dtsi will=
 simply copy 99% of the GXL dtsi,
but surely we could also have an intermediate dtsi but for boards I'm ok wi=
th it, but less for a SoC dtsi,
since it could lead to some confusion.

Finally, yes I could have added the mali node to the GXL dtsi, but the midg=
ard Mali dt-bindings are not upstream
and the family is too big and recent enough to consider having stable bindi=
ngs for now.

Nevertheless, nothing is final, this gxl-mali.dtsi could be merged into the=
 GXL dtsi in the future when we
have proper dt-bindings and a real support of the T820 Mali on the S912.

Kevin, what's your thought about this ?
