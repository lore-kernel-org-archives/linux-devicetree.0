If I read the diff correctly the only change in the syntax is moving the 
bitclock-inversion and frame-inversion properties to DAI nodes also for 
the new style bindings.

I am Ok with that.

The document does not indicate that the same properties could be also 
placed to DAI link level like they used to, from where they would apply 
to both DAI nodes.

I am Ok with this too, but this breaks the backwards compatibility, 
which I guess is generally considered a problem. However, I doubt anyone 
but me has yet used this part of the new syntax and I am happy to fix my 
dts files.

Best regards,
Jyri

ps. I could not find the corresponding code changes in the previous 
patch, so I assume they are coming later.
