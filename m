For Layerscape Chassis(gen3) based chips, the Reference Manual named
the power management IP as COP_PMU instead of RCPM which makes sense
to me as the register map is also quite different from the reg map of
RCPM.  So I think it is reasonable to create a new binding and driver
for the Chassis Gen3 based PMU.  However, the
arch/powerpc/sysdev/fsl_rcpm.c driver probably should be moved to
drivers/soc/fsl, as the Gen2.x Chassis and RCPM IP are also used in
some non-PowerPC Layerscape SoCs.  From what I know, all the RCPM
based IP are all big endian, so there is no need to add this property
for the old binding.

Why do you have to move the wakeup information from device nodes to
the RCPM/PMU node?  For information related to both on-chip device and
SoC integration, the information normally goes into the node of
on-chip device instead of the integration IP's device node.  Existing
example like: interrupt, clock, memory map, and etc.  It is much
cleaner than listing all the interrupts in the interrupt controller's
node, right?
