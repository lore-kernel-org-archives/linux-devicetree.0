So, would you like to accept the generic solution like below:

- Create a generic power sequence driver, and it will be probed
according to compatible string at device tree. At its probe,
we can create a power sequence structure, and let this structure
as the private data for this power sequence device.

struct pwrseq
{
	(*on) (struct pwrseq *);
	(*off) (struct pwrseq *);
	...
};

At power sequence driver ->probe
{
	pwrseq = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(*pwrseq), GFP_KERNEL);
	pwrseq->on = generic_pwrseq_on(pwrseq);
	pwrseq->on = generic_pwrseq_off(pwrseq);
	dev_set_drvdata(dev, pwrseq);
}


- At device driver which need to use power sequence operation
	- Get the node according to phandle, and get its private data
	accordingly. The driver can assign its pwrseq to its structure
       	or not.
	- The driver can call its pwrseq->on and pwrseq->off
	accordingly.
