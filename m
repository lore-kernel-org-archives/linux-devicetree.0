The patch

   ASoC: meson: add axg sound card DT bindings documentation

has been applied to the asoc tree at

   https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/broonie/sound.git 

All being well this means that it will be integrated into the linux-next
tree (usually sometime in the next 24 hours) and sent to Linus during
the next merge window (or sooner if it is a bug fix), however if
problems are discovered then the patch may be dropped or reverted.  

You may get further e-mails resulting from automated or manual testing
and review of the tree, please engage with people reporting problems and
send followup patches addressing any issues that are reported if needed.

If any updates are required or you are submitting further changes they
should be sent as incremental updates against current git, existing
patches will not be replaced.

Please add any relevant lists and maintainers to the CCs when replying
to this mail.

Thanks,
Mark

+Amlogic AXG sound card:
+
+Required properties:
+
+- compatible: "amlogic,axg-sound-card"
+- amlogic,name : User specified audio sound card name, one string
+
+Optional properties:
+
+- amlogic,aux-devs : List of phandles pointing to auxiliary devices
+- amlogic,widgets : Please refer to widgets.txt.
+- amlogic,routing : A list of the connections between audio components.
+
+Subnodes:
+
+- amlogic,dai-link: Container for dai-link level properties and the
+		    CODEC sub-nodes. There should be at least one (and
+		    probably) subnode of this type.
+
+Required dai-link properties:
+
+- sound-dai: phandle and port of the CPU DAI.
+
+Required TDM Backend dai-link properties:
+- dai-format : CPU/CODEC common audio format
+
+Optional TDM Backend dai-link properties:
+- dai-tdm-slot-rx-mask-{0,1,2,3}: Receive direction slot masks
+- dai-tdm-slot-tx-mask-{0,1,2,3}: Transmit direction slot masks
+				  When omitted, mask is assumed to have to no
+				  slots. A valid must have at one slot, so at
+				  least one these mask should be provided with
+				  an enabled slot.
+- dai-tdm-slot-num : Please refer to tdm-slot.txt.
+		     If omitted, slot number is set to accommodate the largest
+		     mask provided.
+- dai-tdm-slot-width : Please refer to tdm-slot.txt. default to 32 if omitted.
+- mclk-fs : Multiplication factor between stream rate and mclk
+
+Backend dai-link subnodes:
+
+- codec: dai-link representing backend links should have at least one subnode.
+	 One subnode for each codec of the dai-link.
+	 dai-link representing frontend links have no codec, therefore have no
+	 subnodes
+
+Required codec subnodes properties:
+
+- sound-dai: phandle and port of the CODEC DAI.
+
+Optional codec subnodes properties:
+
+- dai-tdm-slot-tx-mask : Please refer to tdm-slot.txt.
+- dai-tdm-slot-rx-mask : Please refer to tdm-slot.txt.
