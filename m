The problem I see with that is that it splits what is essentially a
single array with phandle+specifier+pin-id+count into two separate
arrays. Anyone reading/editing the DT needs to fully understand this,
and keep the entries in the two properties in the same order. Putting
everything into a single property makes this much more obvious to me. I
personally don't see any issue with the
of_parse_phandles_with_args_ext() function; it seems pretty clean to me.

In the case of a generic pinctrl IP block that can support an external
GPIO controller but happens not to be hooked up to one within a
particular SoC, that might not be an error. However, that situation is
pretty unlikely, so I think it's find to call dev_err() for now, and we
can change it later if we need.

I believe Grant wants to change the of_xlate prototype in order to be
able to return a different gc value, so this will probably need slight
rework work with that change, once they're both approved. Still, I think
this is fine for now.

I wonder if this shouldn't happen until the pinctrl device is free'd,
and all the GPIO ranges are removed from it?

If we don't do that, I would argue that we shouldn't store ranges[i].gc,
since it might become invalid - I believe the only use of it is within
this function?

Aside from the comments I've made, this series all seems reasonable.
There certainly are alternative ways of doing some of it, but I don't
see any other approach having any particular advantage over this one.
So, the series,
