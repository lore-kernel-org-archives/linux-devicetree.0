nvmem sounds sensible name, I will rename framework to nvmem in next 
version.

Correct me If am wrong.

Regarding write protection/read-only, regmap already has provisions to 
support this feature. regmap would bail out with errors if any attempt 
to write to non-writable regions. It all depends on the data providers 
how they setup the regmap and the bindings for those are specific 
individual data providers I think.

This would protect the user space side and kernel side consumers as well.

This should address your original query, I guess :-)


Thanks,
