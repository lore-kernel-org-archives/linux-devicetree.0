I meant default updates here. These magic values and list came from 
downstream android code, so I will have to audit them before I can say 
that it will be useful for them to be exposed to user.
Most of things that made sense to provide a user control for the 
usecases of playback/capture/sidetone/speakers are already exposed via 
mixer controls.

My view point atleast from hw side was that Codec is Parent which is 
encompassing these different blocks and bus interface. DT representation 
clearly showed that relationship between the parent and child devices.
Binding it through DT will make sure that resources are ready before 
they are instantiated.

All the child devices also have some machine/board specific properties 
and dependency on resources from parent like regmap, clks, and bus.

In ACPI case, am not 100% sure how these will be represented inline with 
hw representation.

Are you suggesting to use MFD here?

These are already modeled as platform devices, except the fact that 
these are children of Codec device.
