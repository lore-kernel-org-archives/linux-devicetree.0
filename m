No, the array index is error prone, that's my point.

Say, two people work on ASL at different times.  One of them sets
everything properly and then the other one removes one of the
endpoints (say, the first one) such that the indexes change, but
doesn't update the remote-endpoint properties somewhere else (eg. by
mistake or lack of experience etc).  Mess ensues.

If you use an identifier instead (the key or a separate one, like the
"endpoint" property value), this particular problem cannot happen.

So, please don't design things to rely on array indexes.

Now, you can use the key (endpoint name) for that too, but having
different conventions for endpoints and ports would be confusing,
wouldn't it?

Rafael
