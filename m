Yes, this is more clear. Thank you for the suggestion.

I consider "dc-gpios" to be a generic name since it is used by many 
different panels. But I would be OK with calling it "a0-gpios" as well. 
It will just require more explanation that this is the A0 *signal* and 
not the A0 *pin*. The actual pin used is labeled *D1* on the controller.

On the other hand, it is labeled as A0 on LEGO's schematic, so perhaps 
a0 is better.
