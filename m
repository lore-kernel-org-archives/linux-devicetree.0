Richard, glad you retrieved our driver. Comments below.

It's just the incrementing local NCO time. Whatever the value of it is
is the timestamp time. When we add the timestamp to the s/w FIFO we
adjust the time to a reference time.

The input events may occur at a rate greater than we want to generate
timestamps at. Maybe we need a better term than divider. The h/w sees x
input signals over x period of time and then samples the input signal at
a divided down period of time to limit the timestamp rate. Timestamp
input sample rate?

I was wrong. It can't. The DTE doesn't know anything about the inputs
hooked up to it nor the frequency of the input events. It needs to be
set by user space and the value can change at run time whenever we want
to change it.

Yes, this isn't a problem.

See above.

Thanks.
