OK, maybe a more serious message would just be fine.

As I said, if you use CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT all interrupt isr will be
threaded (running by threads).

I ask for both tests but I missed the bus-off forther down.

OK, but why is CAN_ERR_CRTL set?

Who does trigger the message above?

Yes. On state change or another error, e.g. the lost-arbitration above.

Obviously the device restarts automatically after bus-off. Can this be
switched off. The normal procedure is to call "ip ... type can restart"
or to set "restart-ms" for automatic restart after the specified delay.

>> Also a sequence to bus-off including the recovery would be nice.

The sequence with no cable connected would be nice as well.

Please fix the error handling first.

Thanks,
