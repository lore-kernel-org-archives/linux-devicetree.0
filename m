Okay, I still don't understand the outdated style. I looked at clocks
defined in arch/arm/boot/dts/stih407-clock.dtsi which is the only file
that uses clock-critical and don't particularly see anything wrong with
the way clocks are defined there.

Anyway, I guess we digress. As long as this patch series is not using
the "legacy style", we are good :)

We need each element of the PLLC to be modeled individually as a clock
node. That is, PLL should only model the multiplier, the dividers
including post and prediv should be modeled as divider clocks (hopefully
being able to use the clk-divider.c library). The sysclks can be
fixed-factor-clock type clocks.

Without this flexible mechanism, we cannot (at least later) model things
like DIV4.5 clock which is the only clock which derives from the output
of PLL multiplier before the post divider is applied.

Since with DT there are are no retakes, we need to get this right the
first time and modifying later will not be an option.
