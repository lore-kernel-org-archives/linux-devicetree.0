Daniel,

sorry for the late response, I just came back from a boat trip around
Capri :D

About the clocks and deferred probing, the issue here is that you might
have trouble to find out if that clock will ever come up. Therefore, I
suggested the easiest heuristic which is "let the DT author decide".

I am fine with allowing more than one clock from DT and get or wait for
all/one clock.

True, do not link dcon node with any of lcd, tda998x or anything else.
If there is support for it in the driver we just use
of_find_compatible_node and let the driver do the magic. From a physical
POV, lcd0 is directly connected to tda998x through dumb RGB pins. DCON
can control data flow to those pins but should not be DT linked.

About clock names for Armada 510 LCD: I suggest "axiclk", "lcdpll", 
"extclk0", "extclk1". IIRC axiclk is 333MHz (or maybe 2xTCLK),
lcdpll can be derived from 2GHz core PLL with min integer divider
of 5. extclk0/1 are dedicated pins and can be used from both lcd0
and lcd1.

DCON and IRE are summarized in the same register description in Dove FS.
Maybe we can split them up and have two nodes or just one if registers
overlap. Anyway, not that important for now.

I suggest to choose the same names v4l2 did, they are the first and
as long as the use case matches, we should reuse their names.

Of course, compatible string of both (virtual) video devices should
be "marvell,armada-510-video" or if you prefer to follow Sascha Hauer's
suggestion reuse the lcd controller node instead of the "super node".
