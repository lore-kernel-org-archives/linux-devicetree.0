Hi Jens,

The driver looks very well implemented, but as you are introducing a new user
space API, we have to very carefully consider every aspect of that interface,
so I'm commenting mainly on user-visible parts.

What is that double indirection for? Normally each command gets its
own data structure, and then you can handle each command in the common
abstraction.

Why -ENOSYS? ioctl does exist ;-)

Add a .compat_ioctl function, to make it work on arm64 as well.
If you got all the data structures right, you can use the same
tee_ioctl function.

Minor nit: put a comma behind the last line in each struct initialization
to make it easier to add another callback.

Try to avoid forward declarations by reordering the code.

Since a lot of callbacks are empty here, I'd probably change the
caller to check for NULL pointer before calling these, and remove
the empty implementations, unless your next patch fills them with
content.

Can you explain why you picked dmabuf as the interface here? Normally this
is used when you have multiple DMA master devices access the same memory,
while my understanding of your use case is that you just have one other
piece of code running on the same CPU accessing this.

Do you need more than one such buffer per device? Could you perhaps just
implement mmap on the chardev as a lot of other drivers do?

I think it would be better not to have 'cma' as part of the function
name -- the driver really should not care at all.

What is the typical and maximum allocation size here?

This belongs into include/uapi/linux/, because you are defining ioctl values
for user space.

I would remove these macros and open-code the users of this as:

#define TEE_IOC_VERSION		_IOR(TEE_IOC_MAGIC, TEE_IOC_BASE, struct tee_ioctl_version)

The reason is that a number of scripts try to scan the header files for
ioctl commands, which will fail if you add another indirection.

That does not work. When you introduce commands, you have to keep them working.
If you get an interface wrong, you can add another ioctl, but you can never
become incompatible. If a user applications wants to see if an interface is
supported, they can use a compile-time check. Building against a version 4.xyz
kernel header means that the code will not run on older kernels.

You can also copy the definition to user space and then do runtime checks
by trying out commands and falling back to something else.

Don't use uuids. You can probably just remove this entire command for
the reasons explained above.

Drop this one too. If someone wants commands that are not implemented
by the core, let them ask you to add them to the core, provided they are
useful and well-designed.

See my questions above. Ideally we should be able to just use mmap here.

Why do you want both directions, exporting a kernel buffer to user
space, as well as using a user space buffer to give to the firmware?

If you can get by with just one of them, drop the other one.

What other driver do you have in mind that would provide the
file descriptor?

Better make that two distinct commands to avoid the union and the flags.
