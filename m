Ok, so as the thread I started on this shows, doing auto-detect is actually
more or less impossible when it comes to the touchscreens, so I do believe
that having separate dts files for clearly identifiable non q8 boards is
best.

I do like the idea of sharing some more stuff though, I'll do a v2 of
the Polaroid MID2407PXE03 and inet86dz dts additions based on first
introducing a sun8i-reference-design-tablet.dtsi which will take most
of the content currently in sun8i-q8-common.dtsi
