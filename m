It has to be

a) identical what we pick from UART, timer, etc

b) compatible to the kernel's clock API

No?

With these two requirements I have some difficulties to imagine how it 
could be different to the clock binding from clock-bindings.txt?

Sounds like an additional argument for clock-bindings.txt ;)

Fine with me :)
