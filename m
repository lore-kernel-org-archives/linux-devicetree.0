Well, that may be true, but the only way to guarantee that the DT
compatible property is matched correctly is to match it in the order
it's written. Forcing driver writers to write the of_match table in a
particular order is quite a hack, and doesn't guarantee the correct
match order in all cases, only typical cases.
