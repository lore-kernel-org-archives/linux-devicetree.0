The early_platform code is certainly not a way to make things simpler,
it just adds one more way of doing the same thing that OF_CLK_DECLARE
already does. We removed the last early_platform users on ARM a few
years ago, and I would hope to leave it like that.

I haven't seen the discussion about your clock drivers, but I know that
usually only a very small subset of the clocks on an SoC are needed
that 'early', and you should use a regular platform driver for the rest.

Can you elaborate on which devices need to access your clocks before
you are able to initialize the clk driver through the regular platform_driver
framework? Do any of these need complex interactions with the clk
subsystem, or do you just need to ensure they are turned on?
