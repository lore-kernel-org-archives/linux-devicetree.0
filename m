The video-interfaces.txt bindings text defines bus-width and data-shift.
The last one would define 'which 8'.

Only if the hardware can do weird stuff like using pins 4-7 and 16-19 would
this be insufficient. But in that case we would need something more detailed
in video-interfaces.txt.

Frankly, unless you've seen anyone do something weird like that I would stick
to bus-width and data-shift.
