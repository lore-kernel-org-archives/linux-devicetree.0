Nit: Elide the blank line? In some other structs too.

Are there #defines or names you can use for those initializers?

This function allocates/initializes a lot of resources without using
devm_ versions of APIs.

.. consequently if probe() fails later on (such as here) then resources
allocated earlier are not released. probe() should either switch to APIs
such as devm_kzalloc() or add some cleanup handling.

I'd expect that to happen right after allocating cprman, since it feels
related to having allocated the cprman object.

Does this need to be dynamically allocated? I think you can just make
these fields in struct bcm2835_cprman; even the array of clks could be:

struct clks clks[BCM2835_CLOCK_COUNT];

These can fail; shouldn't there be error-checking? Or, does
of_clk_add_provider() check for this?
