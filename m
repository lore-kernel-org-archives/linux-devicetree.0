List-Id: devicetree@vger.kernel.org

From: Fabio Estevam <fabio.estevam-3arQi8VN3Tc@public.gmane.org>

According to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mtd/jedec,spi-nor.txt:

"- #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has
sub-nodes representing partitions."

Remove the occurrences of #address-cells/size-cells where no sub-nodes
representing partitions are present.
