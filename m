IMHO this SoC-based identification looks much better, especially considering 
the fact that IP version isn't something easily determinable, as even the 
documentation can sometimes be not really clear about that.

However the s3c6410-i2sv4 string looks a bit unfortunate. AFAIK there were 
two types of I2S IPs on S3C6410 - normal I2S and I2S multichannel. What 
about having a compatible like s3c6410-i2s-multi?
