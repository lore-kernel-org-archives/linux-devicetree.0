I was not happy removing the layout at first, too. However, they are
added rarely (at least recently) and the binding documentation [1]
states that they shall only be added if there are "strong conventions".

Moreover, it is really easy to pass the layout via firmware/u-boot.
Unfortunately, the u-boot provided by CompuLab does not have the
mtdparts commands built-in but the layout can be passed via cmdline as
well. This seems more flexible to me (and I consider this to be good).

Even if we want to have the layout in the devicetree one day (e.g. to
use the same file for u-boot) we can send another follow-up patch adding
them (and discuss this matter in more detail). But let's not prevent the
remaining part of this patch series to enter mainline if there is a
good, easy and flexible alternative.

Cheers,
Christopher
