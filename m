Ideally, if we knew which IP blocks in each SoC were compatible with
each other, we wouldn't need "per-SoC" compatible strings for each
block. However in reality this doesn't happen, due to a combination
of lack of time, lack of / uncertainty of documentation, and lack of
hardware for testing by the contributors.

The per-SoC compatible we ask people to add are a contigency plan,
for when things don't actually work, and we need some way to support
that specific piece of hardware on old DTs. At which point we will
add that SoC-specific compatible as a new compatible string to the
bindings. But not before.
