i don't understand function modules involved with FDT_SW_MAGIC very well
i just think it isn't a bad thing to keep consistent with fdt_check_header()

no, i have no problem about fdt magic in practice

BTW
it seems FDT_SW_MAGIC is involved in fdt_create_empty_tree()@fdt_sw.c which
operate fdt in runtime
in kernel, this function is used in drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/fdt.c
in u-boot, in arch/sandbox/cpu/cpu.c an arch/sandbox/cpu/state.c
the sources mentioned above maybe help you for further decision

okay, make sense
FDT team maybe help decide whether to expose FDT_SW_MAGIC to users
