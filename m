Hmm...actually imx_pcm_init() is just a shell calling dmaengine while it
has its own config and flags. So we still need to extinguish these two
elements for them even if using devm_snd_dmaengine_pcm_register() eventually.

But the idea to merge them into one entry should be great for 3rd platform
or even further one. And a patch for imx-pcm-dma and all callers of it
would be needed then.

Thank you,
Nicolin
