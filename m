Really?  How exactly does it know that each record is longer than
#gpio-cells specifies (I'm speaking from the binding level; not having
custom code that just "knows" the the records have additional
padding).

I have no interest in creating exceptions to the phandle-with-args
pattern since it adds yet more implicit knowledge about how to parse.
For example, the common gpio code can no longer parse a gpios property
that is padded out because the common code doesn't know anything about
padding.

Oh, I see....  Does this gpio-maps property sit beside a normal
"gpios" property?  Or is it in a completely separate node?  If it sits
beside a normal "gpios" property and lines up with the gpio properties
there, then I would just make it a tuple for each gpio.  Ie:

gpios = <&gpio1 13 0>, <&gpio1 14 0>, <&gpio2 0 0>;
gpio-pinmux = <1 1>,   <5 1>,         <20 1>;
