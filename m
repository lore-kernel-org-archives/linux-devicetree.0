Yes, I have now made it clearer that this is a very serious error.

I have now added it, even though I am still not sure if it is needed. Under 
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_FULL a spin_lock_irqsave is just a plain spin_lock anyway 
(plus type checking on the flags argument).

Maybe I am just confused with the terminology. What I mean is that the only 
error reporting that is supported by the hardware (apart from AMBA bus errors, 
but that is unrelated to the discussion) is the error counter related errors.

 From what I can see CAN_ERR_BUSERROR is not reported in the error counter 
related cases by the other drivers I looked in. The grcan hardware does not 
support reporting errors like form and stuff errors and which bits the errors 
occured in and the like.

Have I understood it correctly that reporting about protocol errors like that is 
what it is to support CAN_CTRLMODE_BERR_REPORTING? This seems to be the case but 
the janz-ican3 driver connects CAN_CTRLMODE_BERR_REPORTING to all error frame 
reporting, so I am not entirely sure.

Sorry for confusing the matter. There is no interrupt for error warning, but 
there are interrupts for increases of the error counters and the other state 
changes. So to be able to report on error warning I check the error counters and 
do it manually.

Yes, the hardware becomes error active after having monitored 11 consecutive 
recessive bits on the bus 128 times (as allowed by the 2.0 CAN spec). There is 
no way of turning this off, so to conform to the normal linux procedure of not 
doing this, I shut down the device on bus off interrupt.

In addition I have thrown out the arbitration lost error frame generation as 
arbitration errors can not be singled out. The TXLOSS interrupt might be due to 
arbitration error, but is also triggered in great numbers when there is no one 
else on the can bus or when there is a problem with the hardware interface or 
the bus itself.

This is how things look currently with no one else on the bus:
~ # cansend can0 123#45
   can0  20000004  [8] 00 08 00 00 00 00 60 00   ERRORFRAME
         controller-problem{tx-error-warning}
         error-counter-tx-rx{{96}{0}}
   can0  20000004  [8] 00 20 00 00 00 00 80 00   ERRORFRAME
         controller-problem{tx-error-passive}
         error-counter-tx-rx{{128}{0}}
~ #

And this is how it looks with a short-circuited bus:
~ # cansend can0 123#45
   can0  20000004  [8] 00 08 00 00 00 00 90 00   ERRORFRAME
         controller-problem{tx-error-warning}
         error-counter-tx-rx{{144}{0}}
   can0  20000004  [8] 00 20 00 00 00 00 98 00   ERRORFRAME
         controller-problem{tx-error-passive}
         error-counter-tx-rx{{152}{0}}
   can0  20000040  [8] 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ERRORFRAME
         bus-off

Thanks a lot for the input! Much appreciated!

Cheers,
