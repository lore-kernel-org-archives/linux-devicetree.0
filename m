Sorry, but this is not quite right :(
Patches from Geert will add only first clock for device and not all
of them. The right way to add all clocks for device from DT using 
generic PM domain represented in my series:
 
 ARM: keystone: pm: switch to use generic pm domains

This might not work if more then one device connected to PM domain.
Then some clocks might be part of GPD if they needed to power on/off it.
But Kevin is right and even in this case, pm_clk infrastructure can still be used,
because RK PM domain is Platform device and clocks can be attached to it
using pm_clk API. I did it in my RFC series https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/25/365
- all clacks attached to PM domain in .probe
- then pm_clk_suspend/pm_clk_resume used in .power_off/.power_on callbacks

Benefits: there is no need to implement custom lists of clocks
struct rockchip_pm_domain {
	struct clk			**clks;
