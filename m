Are there two clock controllers? Sorry I don't understand the
architecture here very well. Nodes with reg properties in the
same range should be near each other. We don't group all i2c
controllers into the same node because they're logically i2c
controllers. We express the hierarchy of devices with container
nodes. The clocks node is only useful for board-level clocks, not
things that are inside the SoC.
