We only support continuous register offset in pinctrl-single driver.
GPDRx is in range of 0x40e0000c~0x40e0010c, GAFRx is in range of
0x40e00054~0x40e00070.

So I suggest you to split them as two pinmux controller. If you define them into
one pinmux controler, it's also OK. But they are still two pins in the on pinmux
controller. And you should avoid to access those spare pins in the middle.

I don't suggest you to support multiple reg/value/mask pairs for each pin in
pinctrl-single driver. It's too complex. It already exceeds the design scope
of the pinctrl-single driver.
