I don't think the symlinks should be in arch/arm/boot, since that's not
where the source files are. They should either exist in
arch/arm/boot/dts (since that's the source file location, and that
generally determines the object/binary/output file location in the
kernel build system), or in some user-specified directory, created as a
side-effect of e.g. "make dtbs_install". There have been some small
discussions of a dtb install target before, but I don't remember the
details.

I don't think a distro should need to know the DTB filename at all.
Rather, the/a bootloader should know which platform it's running on, and
provide a variable/... to the boot script/... that defines the DTB
filename. That would completely remove all the knowledge of DTB
filenames from distros.

I don't think there's anything stopping you from renaming
dts/armada-370-mirabox.dts to globalscale,mirabox.dts, as a one-time
ABI-breaking event, if you want the compatible value to be the filename
for those DTs. Is there a reason you'd want the .dts and .dtb filenames
to differ? You'd mentioned flexibility in renaming the .dts files, but
why would you need that flexibility?

Perhaps if we had to, we could just rename all .dts to conform to the
new naming rule and then I can deal with the bootloader fallout for Tegra:-(
