I just took a brief look at this. My first impression is that the
fw_dev_node structure is weird when all callers just do (in patch 2)

+	struct fw_dev_node fdn = {
+		.of_node = dev->of_node,
+		.acpi_node = ACPI_COMPANION(dev),
+	};

I'd much rather see an interface that passes the 'struct device'
pointer down to dev_get_named_gpiod() and all other exported
functions, and then internally does the conversion at the point
where the access is done.
