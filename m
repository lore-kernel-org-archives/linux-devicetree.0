This series adds device tree support for TI EMIF SDRAM controller
driver. For this, a binding has been added for representing AC timing
parameters and other details of LPDDR2 memories.

This series depends on the series for adding EMIF driver [1]

Changes in RFC v3:
* Removed support for DDR3
* Incorporated review comments from Olof

Changes from RFC v3 to RFC v4:
* Added a new patch to add DT support in the EMIF driver
