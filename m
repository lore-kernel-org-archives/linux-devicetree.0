 *sigh* except if that idiot manager [whom we're keenly aware of]
orders them to delete absolutely everything (find . -name '*sunxi*' |
xargs git rm) and overwrite it with their internally-managed tree,
causing absolute mayhem in the process...

 yes. http://libv.livejournal.com/24735.html

 at $7.50 for a dual-core processor, and i am *not* going to tell you
the quad-core price, i don't believe it can be considered to be a
race, or even a competition.  they're *OUT*, man.   really.

 oh wait - did you mean for "1st to have fully supported upstream GPU
driver"?  that would be veery nice.

 i'll put that on the list of recommendations, but - again - i need a
list of clear benefits and returns as to why that should happen.
