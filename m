OK, thanks, as I understood something which covers more than simple
CPU<->CODEC point-to-point connections is needed.

I have also been working on adding proper HDMI audio support for Exynos. 
One issue I can see with proposed binding is that when we use the graph 
binding for both video and audio with a device that supports both, 
e.g. HDMI transmitter we need to somehow differentiate the purpose 
of each port.  To avoid the sound subsystem parsing video port/endpoint 
nodes and the other way around.

For instance in arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036.dtsi we have already:

	hdmi: hdmi@20034000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3036-inno-hdmi";
		reg = <0x20034000 0x4000>;
		...

		hdmi_in: port {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			hdmi_in_vop: endpoint@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				remote-endpoint = <&vop_out_hdmi>;
			};
		};
	};

And with the sound binding added it could have become:

	hdmi: hdmi@20034000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3036-inno-hdmi";
		..
		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			/* video */
			hdmi_in: port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				hdmi_in_vop: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&vop_out_hdmi>;
				};
			};

			/* audio */
			hdmi_audio_out: port@? {
				reg = <?>;	
				endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&i2s>;
				};
			};
	};

	i2s: i2s@10220000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3036-i2s", "rockchip,rk3066-i2s";
		reg = <0x10220000 0x4000>;
		...
	};

Now within individual device bindings the type of the port (audio, 
video) could be determined by reg property, by assigning specific 
values for video and audio.  But if we wanted to make this more generic 
we would probably need something like a property determining the port's 
purpose, e.g.

	type = "audio";

Regarding compatible string for the card, how about "soc-sound-card-v1"
instead of "asoc-simple-graph-card" ? Or "soc-simple-graph-card"? 
Appending version now could let us avoid inventing funny names when 
it turns we need some different binding in future.
