It looks to be much closer representation of the hardware in dt. It also
enables to have more control of each individual PHYs. For example, we can have
something like status="disabled" for channels which is disabled.

right. Can't we use of_address_to_resource here?

You anyway iterate while creating PHYs based on some constant. Now you have to
iterate over the sub-nodes.

ah.. there isn't any. The author of the other multi-phy driver [1] also feels
this will just add to the complexity of the driver.

Maybe we should ask the opinion of others?
