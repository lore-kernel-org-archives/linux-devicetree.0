Hi,

Here are a few simple patches for the jz4740.

First adds dynamic sampling support to jz4740-i2s.
Then two to add a simple binding and DT support.
Then a patch to enable the codec clock.

These are in preparation for jz4780 and ci20 later on.

These are based on 3.19-rc6. 

If you would like to have them rebased to a different tree, please tell.

Thank-you
