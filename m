Doing it that way will also catch platform_devices that were created
apart from of_platform_populate() and manually attached to an of_node,
which is done some times. It will also break whenever multiple devices
reference the same node if they call of_device_node_put().

For example, a platform device providing an i2c bus will have a child
device that represents the i2c bus, and that i2c device will point to
the same node.

The flag clear really does need to be kept in the
platform_device_unpopulate path because it is only to be used internally
by of_platform_{populate,depopulate}

Yes, that is a bug. I want to get some unittests added to the DT code to
verify that reference counts are being tracked correctly. Right now it
is an utter mess.

This new code looks good to me. I haven't done any testing though.

Right, that was just a side comment. I like to avoid recursion as much
as possible in kernel code, but I'm certainly not going to NAK on that
basis.

:-) Good to know.
