Hi,

This series adds irqdomain and device tree support for both the
interrupt and GPIO controllers of AT91 SoC.

The series has already been sent some time ago but has been
reworked to address Rob and Grant comments. The reworked patches
are marked with corresponding "vX" tags...

The series can go on top of Grant's patch series and depends on it:
"[PATCH v3 00/25] irq_domain generalization and refinement".

It also depends on the material already sent for at91 (base, pm_cleanup,
device-board, 9x5 branches on arm-soc).

The 3.3-rc3 is needed if you whish to test them (ioremap fix by Russell).

The USB driver modification will need a "Acked-by" from someone at linux-usb.

Note that I have remove all "Acked-by" form first round as the patches are
deeply modified.

All this is available here:
