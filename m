Yes, this mask is actually an "I am not using this channel"-mask.

This statement hits the nail on the head. Thank you!

That is meaningful. So would the following be ok?

+ .....
+       if (pdev->dev.of_node) {
+ .....
+       } else {
+               dev_err(&pdev->dev,
+                       "Failed to initialize channels, because device
tree not available: %d\n", rc);
+               bcm2835_dma_free(od);
+               return rc;
+      }
+
+       dev_dbg(&pdev->dev, "Initialized %i DMA channels\n", i);
+
+ .....

The most common comment about this is that people will not put effort in
the upstream kernel as long as there is no comfortable way for debugging
in the upstream kernel (i.e. at least USB support).......
