Ok, let me think about it and propose something, an approach.

I must admit I like the structure I saw in drivers/amba/bus.c, ie. to have
something like :
 - a bus driver core (sound/ac97/bus.c ?)
   Split between this and sound/pci/ac97_codec.c I don't know yet.
   => an instance of this bus will be instanciated from each snd_ac97_bus() call
      just as now
   => bus_register(&ac97_bustype)
   => ac97_bus_probe/remove(), match/uevent/dev_attrs
   => ac97_driver_register(struct ac97_driver *drv)

 - a ac97 driver structure (struct ac97_driver) with :
   => u32 vendor_id (vendor_id = lambda(vendor_id1, vendor_id2))
   => u32 vendor_id_mask (mask of bits to match)
   ...

 - each ac97 controller will call snd_ac97_bus().
   In my case, that's sound/arm/pxa2xx-ac97.c or sound/soc/pxa2xx-ac97.c,
   whatever.

 - each ac97 codec will subscribe to the bus
   ac97_driver_register(struct ac97_driver *drv, u32 vendor_id, u32 vendor_mask)
   For example wm9713.c will call :
     ac97_driver_register(drv, AC97_VENDOR(0x...., 0x....), 0xffffffff);

Well, if I'm totally mistaken, tell me. If not it will take me a bit of time to
write is down properly in a Documentation/ file.

Cheers.
