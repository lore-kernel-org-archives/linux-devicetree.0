That's essentially what we're saying here: ACPI isn't ready, let's use =
DT while
it's sorted out and if someone wants to try to require ACPI at some lev=
el
today, they should figure out how to translate it into DT. In reality, =
it might
be easiest to ship a static DT file while ACPI is being developed and s=
orted
out.

I think we're getting bogged down by the hypothetical AML-in-DT case. W=
e won't
know if we want/need it until we see what kind of stuff vendors think t=
hey will
need to do in AML. On x86 it's mostly used to abstract out per-board
differences, not whole SoC behavior. It also depends on how much of the=
ir
hardware differences the silicon vendors decide to punt to software to =
manage
-- that's going to work a lot less well in this type of environment tha=
n it
does on 32-bit today.

I agree that there should be engagement, but not at the expense of forw=
ard
progress using the technologies we're finally sorting out how to use
successfully. In other words, we should continue enabling DT on these
platforms while ACPI happens in the background for now. People who
will longer-term depend on ACPI should of course get engaged in that,
but things aren't going to work well if they=A0abandon working on the
short-to-medium term solutions of continued DT usage.

I think we're in full agreement on this.

I don't think anyone is arguing for board files here, that's a dead end=

There might however be quirks needed for drivers here and there, at lea=
st for
new platforms (chipsets), errata workarounds, etc. That's expected, and=
 it's
something that they need on x86 today as well.

I think we're getting bogged down in details here, unfortunately. Let's=
 see
what people have in mind to implement in AML before we go too far down =
this
path. In theory it could be a nightmare to deal with it given the featu=
re set
and complexity of AML, but in reality chances are we can do quite well =
with
just device-tree (as Arnd and others have been arguing as well).

So I think we can postpone much of this debate until we actually have e=
xamples
of what people will use in the real world.

Yeah, it would need to be generic enough to not require per-board chang=
es.
Again, let's see how things turn out in reality before we go too far do=
wn that
path, doing it on theoretical needs is going to overly complicate thing=
s.

There's going to be need for both, and we can't sacrifice work on the
short-to-medium term solution because I really don't want things to
stumble right away. As Jon is saying, lots of companies are spending
significant resources on this, and we need to make sure things are as
successful as possible right out the door.

That means not restricting short-term solutions with promises/wishes/ho=
pes
that things will magically get sorted out by themselves down the
road. Given the initial output from the ACPI side of things, that's way
too scary a bet to make.

UEFI already allows this, as far as I know? Even if both are passed, we=
 can
easily make DT take precedence over ACPI, just like DT overrides ATAGs =
today.

Yes, but so is doing a native ACPI implementation. Anyway, let's hold o=

we know what we're actually going to need.

Right -- as we've seen with DT where it was easy-peasy on PowerPC since=
 there
were only 2-4 real vendors involved, things get substantially more comp=
licated
when you increase that by an order of magnitude. In this case, we'd be
increasing it with an order of magnitude _and_ bring in their firmware
engineers to be involved too (since we would no longer have control ove=
r what
gets put into the tables).

While there are people who have a lot of ACPI experience today, the env=
ironment
around it (community/participants and technical diversity) _and_ the ne=
w need
for more complex things is new to everybody. As we've seen with DT, we =
can't
always rely on the existing people to have capacity for the onslaught o=
f
activity that will come down the pipe.

As mentioned in other replies in the thread, I was a bit careless in ho=

I phrased this. We can't just wait until they're done, but we also shou=
ldn't
do it all ourselves. And we definitely shouldn't bet our house on it re=

in a useable solution at this point.

I think it'll depend on what will actually be needed on real systems. A=
nd
I'm not making many assumptions on long term here -- we can't let that
distract us from getting the first few years sorted out first.

We agree more than we disagree on this whole discussion, I believe.
