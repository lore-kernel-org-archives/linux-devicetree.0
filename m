Thanks for the clarification. Couldn't you assure the device is in a
defined state by calling qca_power_shutdown() as one of the first
things in qca_wcn3990_init()?

Some more comments on the functions, for if the retry loop is kept:

A failure here is not caused by a communication problem, so this
should probably be a 'return' instead of a 'goto'.

nit: add a space between ':' and '%d'

Is qca_power_shutdown() needed or would qca_power_setup(hu,
false) be enough? This is qca_power_shutdown():

static int qca_power_shutdown(struct hci_dev *hdev)
{
        struct hci_uart *hu = hci_get_drvdata(hdev);

        host_set_baudrate(hu, 2400);
        qca_send_vendor_pulse(hdev, QCA_WCN3990_POWEROFF_PULSE);
        return qca_power_setup(hu, false);
}

It additionally sends the power off pulse, which is also done in the
loop (though it is currently called QCA_WCN3990_FORCE_BOOT_PULSE).

The code flow with the gotos and the error handling at the end of the
loop is a bit messy. Moving the power down to the top of the loop
(basically in line with my comment above to get rid of the loop) would
help here. In this case checking 'ret' in the loop condition (which I
suggested to remove) would make sense, since it elimninates the need
for the break/return in the success case. But if we can do without the
loop even better :)

Ok, thanks for confirming.
