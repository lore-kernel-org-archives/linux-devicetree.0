The key point is that *description* of the requirements for coherency
becomes independent of kernel configuration. Yes, whether or not a
kernel can support those depends on the configuration.

Sorry, but that is not quite what I said.

I said that if you read dma-coherent as specifying *the requirements*
for coherency (i.e. "coherent iff Normal, Inner Shareable, Inner WB
Cacheable, Outer WB Cacheable"), rather than specifying that there is
coherency given some unspecified requirements, then it is possible to
use it in a manner which is consistent and independent of kernel
configuration. If the kernel uses memory attributes that don't meet
those requirements, it can know that the device cannot be used in a
coherent manner.

If we take that stance, then we can cater for other requirements (e.g.
Outer Shareable on Keystone) by having properties to specify those
requirements (e.g. dma-outer-coherent). The tricky part is how the
kernel decides how best to use that information, but that is a problem
regardless.

Yes, we would need to either alter the OF code, or some code which makes
use of this. Surely it's possible to have this logic in an arch
callback?

No, we do not necessarily have to try to dynamically handle every
possible case, especially as the vastly common case is the one I called
out above.

For those boards where we're going to have some code special-casing
those regardless, automatically deciding to have the kernel use the
preferred set of attributes is fine. However, to do this I don't think
we should provide board+kernel specific semantics to dma-coherent, and
should at least precisely specify the coherency requirements.

Thanks,
Mark.
