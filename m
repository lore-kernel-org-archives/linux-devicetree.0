Okey, I'll ditch it for v4 unless someone yells out.

Being a micro controller there are a lot of parts with small
variations in peripherals and Flash sizes.
For the clock stuff; the LPC43xx series added 3 base clocks to the CCU
over the LPC18xx series. One of these clocks is only present on the
LPC4370.

So for the CGU base clocks there aren't a whole lot of variants I guess.

Good question.

For now my approach have been to stick everything in one common file
(lpc18xx.dtsi), but this can be changed of course. Right now I think
we should just wait and see which parts that are added to mainline and
then split things as required.
