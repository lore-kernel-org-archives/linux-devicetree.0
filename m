Please consider prioritising this over writing e-mails; talking about
device tree does often seem more popular than solving the harder
problems.

The missing bit with generic card drivers has been anyone other than
Morimoto-san working on it; I don't think anyone thinks that is a bad
idea for the simple cases.

Please, as I have repeatedly asked you, go back and look at the previous
discussions on this topic and familiarise yourself with the needs of
advanced audio subsystems.  This has been covered ad nauseum in the
past, there's no need to go through it all over again.

That is a rather strongly worded statement which doesn't appear to
correspond to reality; for example there are a number of Linux based
smartphones in production many if not most of which have complex audio
needs and components with lots of flexibility.

Please do the research I have been asking you to do and/or contribute
code, this will be less time consuming for all of us.

Look at where the names come from...

The clock configuration bindings don't currently exist, won't cover the
dynamic cases and won't help non-DT platforms.  Remember also that we
don't even have a clock API of any kind on a good proportion at the
minute and don't have the common clock API on some of the rest.

This is the sort of information that you should be able to discover if
you review the previous discussions.

One of the devices you're looking at here is WM8962 - it does actually
have the ability to do a bunch of the things that make decisions about
clocking interesting.
