That sounds like a better approach if we don't care about
failures to register a clock. Returning a value from a function
and not using it isn't really a great design.

I worry that if we start returning errors from clk_hw_register()
that something will go wrong though, so really I don't know why
we want to ignore errors at all. Just for debugging a boot hang?
Can't we use early console to at least see that this driver is
failing to probe and debug that way?
