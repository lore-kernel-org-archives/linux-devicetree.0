Something like this should do it:
#!/usr/bin/gawk -f
# find arch/arm/boot/dts/ -type f -name *.dts* | xargs
./mem_node_add_dev_type.awk -i inplace
BEGIN { go = 0 }
/[^-]memory ?{/ { go = 1; idx = 0; device_type = 0 }

go == 1 {
        buf[idx++] = $0
        if ($0 ~ /device_type/)
                device_type = 1

        if ($0 ~ /};/) {
                print buf[0]

                if (!device_type) {
                        buf[0] = buf[1]
                        gsub(/[^\t]*/, "", buf[0])
                        buf[0] = buf[0] "device_type = \"memory\";"
                } else {
                        delete buf[0]
                }

                for (i in buf)
                        print buf[i]
                delete buf

                go = 0
                device_type = 0
        }
        next
}

{ print }

Gives me: 249 files changed, 249 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-) on v4.6-rc1.

Running the my check script after this reveals that 83 DTs lack the
device_type parameter, but these seem to also lack the memory node as
well. Wonder why my script didn't pick up the missing memory node in
those... I also doubt that the memory node is set by the boot loader
in some of these boards.
