I would object to dropping the shift :-)

If you look at the two clk extensions in my rockchip patches you can see that 
they use a different regiment to set values.

Using the lower 16 bits to set the value and the upper 16 bit to mark which 
values are changed, i.e. (mask << shift + 16) | (val << shift).

(I'm not sure, if the naming or solution could be improved though)
