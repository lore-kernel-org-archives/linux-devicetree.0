After a chat w/Martin on IRC, It turns out runtime PM wont help here.

The reason is because there are physically two PHY devices[1].  Those 2
devices will be treated independely by runtime PM, and have separate
use-counting, which means doing what I proposed would cause a reset to
happen when either device was probed.

So, I think it's OK as it is.
