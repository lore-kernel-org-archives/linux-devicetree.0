Thank you for the clarification. Rob's comment was logical and made me 
re-think this. He pointed out that I was causing a kernel panic in the 
case of Uncorrectable errors which is not the desired response and will 
need to change.

I'll update this patch to only count errors. I'll need to re-think how 
the network driver can be alerted that there was an uncorrectable error 
but that could be a later patch.

Great feedback. Thank you Mauro and Rob for reviewing and commenting!
