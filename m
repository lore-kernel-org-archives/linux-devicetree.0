On the surface, the patch looks reasonable.  But it is not obvious to me why
the error message is occurring.  I would like to understand the cause before
saying the patch is good.

What kernel version is showing the error?  For a specific architecture
(the patch lists 'riscv, nios, etc'), which config and device tree source?

And again, what is the calling path?
