Definition of clock signal and it's inversion varies between chip 
manufacturers and sometimes it may not be possible to get all the dai 
drivers to work identically in this respect. Because of this in some 
cases there may be a need to set the inversion bit only at one end of 
the link.

I think there was an example of this in some mail regarding the 
simple-card DT-bidings, but I can't find it ATM.

Best regards,
Jyri
