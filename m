Yep, I meant 'return false'.

Isn't that the purpose of the
IRQF_NO_SUSPEND_SAFE/IRQF_SHARED_TIMER_OK/IRQF_SHARED_WAKEUP_SIBLING_OK
flag ?

Yep, that was the plan, just wanted to make sure I had correctly
understood the problem before posting an RFC.

Actually if we force users to pass the IRQF_XXX_SAFE (I'm tired writing
all the potential names :-)), when mixing IRQF_NO_SUSPEND
and !IRQF_NO_SUSPEND handlers, we shouldn't bother deactivating normal
handlers (those without IRQF_NO_SUSPEND), 'cause they claimed they could
safely be called in suspended state.

I thought they were always safe...

I'm not sure to understand that one. Where am I traversing irq_descs
(irq_to_desc, which is called when testing wakeup_armed status, is a
direct table indexing operation) ?
Moreover, I'm not sure when the PM_POST_SUSPEND event is sent, and
testing the WAKEUP_ARMED flag should be safe in all cases, right ?

Yes it does.
Thanks for the review.
