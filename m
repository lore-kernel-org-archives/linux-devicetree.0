that was quick, thanks!

actually I think that the Meson6/MX/<however it is called> clock
controller is different (based on a quick look).
so we may end up with a similar situation that we have on
GXBB/GXL/GXM: the clock controller will stay in the corresponding
.dtsi and we have to "duplicate" the clock assignments for each SoC

however, I guess at some point we can create a .dtsi with all the bits
that are shared between Meson8 and Meson8b (during my experiments
meson8m2.dtsi just inherits meson8.dtsi and overrides a bunch of
compatibles). we can discuss whether we want to move the clock
controller to that shared/common .dtsi as well once we start
generalizing this
