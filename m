Dealing with 2 versions of PSCI bindings rather than simply extending
the existing binding will be more pain for the kernel, kvmtool, qemu
and xen than any benefit of using a hyphen will provide.

This binding was written by Will Deacon and acked by Arnd and Nicolas
not to mention the follow-up patches to use it over the last 9 months.
Hardly a bunch of newbies that don't understand DT. That binding had 3
postings. No one complained about the underscores then. It is
precisely because it has been reviewed that I don't think we should be
changing it. I don't see simply adding additional function ids as
grounds for redoing the binding. The 32/64 bit calling convention
handling may be a different discussion which is fine with me. Dealing
with that was not my goal here.

That's fine, just mark it unstable and we can change it later. I'll
sit quiet for 9 months first and then complain about it. I'll be
waiting for your patch to change all the '_' to '-' in all the binding
docs and dts files. Since everything is unstable, that shouldn't be a
problem to change. :)
