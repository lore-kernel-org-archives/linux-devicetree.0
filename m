This is fine as an intermediate step, but I'm afraid that the overhead of 
work needed to describe all the bindings using C language directly will be 
pretty big. C language isn't really best fitted for such purposes.

If we agree to base on this, but solely as a mechanism and a base for 
further work, my idea would be to introduce a schema description language 
anyway and then some code generator that would generate C code from 
schemas described using such language (and possibly also something to 
generate textual documentation from schemas, so we could have a central 
repository of indexed DT bindings, for example on [1] - maybe kerneldoc 
could be reused here).

Such design would allow for describing a lot of cases using a simple 
description language, while leaving the possibility of adding inline C 
snippets, like PHP in HTML, to handle those super complex ones.
