Up to now I have used the PCI smmu description as described in Suravee's
patch and this does not work anymore with 4.6-rc1 since the default
domain was introduced. So now I see 2 SMRs matching a single streamid
(in my case 256, one steming from the "platform device" side of the host
controller and one steming from the PCI device) and this causes SMCF
(stream match conflict fault). So PCIe PF does not work.

I observe the fault only when I override the PCIe ACS property in my
case which was pretty confusing (each PF/VF is put in a separate group).

What is the correct syntax then: mmu-masters = <&pcie0>?

instead of

+			 mmu-masters = <&pcie0
+				/* 1:00:[0,3] */ 256 257 258 259
+				/* 2:00:[0,3] */ 512 513 514 515
+				/* 3:00:[0,3] */ 768 769 770 771
+				/* 4:00:[0,3] */ 1024 1025 1026 1027>

Is there a plan to update/upstream the dt description for PCIe smmu.

Thank you in advance

Best Regards

Eric
