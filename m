No. I get the point about the bridge driver, but that's not what I want.

I agree that the bridge driver configures the chip selects, address ranges
and timings, but it shouldn't do that at the time the bridge driver is
instantiated. 

That would mean that all configuration is fixed at boot time.

That's where we disagree. I don't want the drivers to be children of the bridge.

All the drivers that are controlled by a chip select and/or bus access method are
written without ever dealing with the bridge; they just expect the configuration to be
valid and need to only know the address range they reside.

As you pointed the i2c component, which was a child of the device node, it is better to become a 
phandle reference.

That's what I'm proposing for the bridge configuration as well, so that the configuration is applied
only when a device requests it. This is important for hot-plugging, and or when using stuff like
device overlays.
