The developers who create the driver and modify it.  Only upstream 
contributions count.

The upstream reviewers verify it, and if they see a problem, they reject 
the patch.

I'm not sure what you're getting at. Everything is best-effort. The 
binding for a given device is supposed to accurately, but minimally, 
describe the hardware so that the driver can program the device 
properly. Specific properties are added to the binding to handle 
specific cases. If a binding includes a description of properties that 
are not used by the driver, the developer is typically asked to remove 
those.

So I don't understand the "100% right" comment.

1) The effort = the effort by upstream developers to review the binding.

2) lack of benefit = proprietary and out-of-tree drivers do not benefit 
the community.

Why bother creating a binding if there's no driver to use it?

If a developer creates a binding without a driver, then it's very hard 
to know if that binding is correct.  That's like creating a recipe 
without attempting to make the food.  How do you know it actually tastes 
good?  No one would ever ask a chef to create a "technically correct" 
recipe without cooking it first and tasting it.

I'm not sure how many times we need to repeat this, but the idea that 
the DT binding documentation can be used as official documentation for 
the hardware is absurd.  What's wrong with the ACTUAL hardware 
documentation provided by the manufacturer in PDF format?  The DT 
binding has no value without an actual driver.
