Not sure about that, the approach you describe there sounds entirely
reasonable to me. The DMA specifier is not just a feature of the consumer
(the DMA slave) but of the connection between the consumer and the
controller (slave and master). This connection consists of the combination
of a request line and a bus master that is able to access the fifo
register, so it makes sense to list both here.

As far as I understand, the controller has to pick two master numbers
here: one for the memory side and one for the fifo side. The memory
side is a property of the dma engine, and that should always be the
same one, while the fifo side depends on the slave that is connected.
