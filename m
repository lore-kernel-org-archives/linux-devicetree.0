This patchset adds sound card support to APQ8016 SBC board aka DB410c.
APQ8016 has 4 MI2S( Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary) which can be routed
to internal wcd codec or external codecs. This routing and various board specifics
are controlled by 2 mux registers.

All these patches are tested for HDMI audio via adv7533 bridge and Analog audio
on APQ8016-SBC, msm8916-mtp boards.

Changes since v4 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/5/22/628)
  - moved all the dt parsing to single function, spotted by Mark.
  - removed unnecessary setting of card->dev = NULL spotted by Mark.
  - renamed the dai links to the correct codec names.
  - removed the special case for EPROBE_DEFER in probe, spotted by Mark.
  - Dropped all the Changes since comments as most of the patches
   in last series are merged to topic/qcom branch.
