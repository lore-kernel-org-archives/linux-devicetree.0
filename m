Hi all,

This patch series updates the ARM NSP DTS and BCM958625HR in order to
support the SFP connected to port 5 on these reference boards.

I will be submitting the functional changes to drivers/net/dsa/b53 once
net-next opens back up, but this is largely independent from getting
these 3 patches out.

Thank you

Changes in v3:

- changes i2c controller node name from i2c to i2c (Ray)
- updated binding patch to have bulleted reg-names and interrupt-names
  (Rob)


Changes in v2:

- added missing managed = "in-band-status" property
- reworded the commit message to explain the limitation of i2c-proc
  is of 63 bytes per transfer, not 256 bytes
