Yes there are documentation and helpers I looked into, but to the best 
of my limited knowledge not for the gate + dual-rate case. Then you jump 
to complicated configurations combining multiple base clocks that don't 
really make sense here. After one frustrating day of trying to wrap 100 
lines of code into the clock framework I gave up and kept the simple 
custom driver. There is a single client for this clock so I don't quite 
see the benefits/ROI of mapping a simple piece of hardware with a 
complex model.
