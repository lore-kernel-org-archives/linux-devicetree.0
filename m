That looks a bit strange. As I said in another email, MU physical does not have multi
Channels (here you mean are virtual channels).  And one whole MU instance is
Exclusively used by SCU, why we need abstract them into 4 channels to use separately
with extra unnecessary resource hold and code path executed.

This part of code has been used for a long time and we've never met the stall
Issue which means SCU firmware guarantee it well. But I agree a timeout
mechanism Is better. However,  if only for this reason, we can simply add a
timeout mechanism in MU library function as well, but still is far from a strong
enough reason to switch to a more complexed mailbox one.

In our implementation:
1) One channel per MU
2) Tx using the same way to send msg as sc_ipc_write() in polling mode
3) Rx enables the first word interrupt and polling for the rest of them in
a hrtimer.

The possible extra cost comparing to simple polling way:
1) Extra unnecessary code execution path of mailbox which is not used by SCU MU
2) Interrupt latency
3) Extra memory copy handling RX message separately.
4) Extra schedule of hrtimer polling

Some of them probably could be optimized. However, besides the slow problem,
the extra unnecessary complexity and can't be generic (specific to SCU) are also
important ones. 

And the MU general purpose interrupt feature and general purpose flags feature
may also not supported by mailbox well.
