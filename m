We had AUDMUX, so "AUDMIX" doesn't sound bad to me at all. The only
reason that we are discussing this is because RM uses more "AUDMIX"s
over "amix"s. I'd have chosen AUDMIX if I were you, yet not strongly
as I said. And it looks like Rob is asking you to use AUDMIX in DT
binding doc.

OK. I am actually more wondering how you connect it with SAI on
the software level: for imx8qm, SAI4/5 are used, but later SoCs
might use other SAI blocks. So it might be necessary to indicate
the connections in DT.

Ah, it sounds like a looping block then, receiving bclk from SAI4
-- slave, and routing the bclk back to SAI4 -- master; SAI4 works
at ASYNC mode?

DPCM? So you are having the links in the sound DT nodes, i.e. the
machine driver?

Thanks
