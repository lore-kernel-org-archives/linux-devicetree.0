Hi Ulf,

I will suggest some wording changes not of which are not compulsory and
left to you to pick up or drop.

Since we are trying to avoid usage of "clusters"(as it's not architecturally
defined, but I know it's too late as it widely used everywhere). Also this
binding is not just OSI specific, it can be used for Platform Co-ordinated
also so let's not specify them at all.

How about:
"ARM systems can have multiple cores sometimes in hierarchical arrangement.
This often, but not always, maps directly to the processor power topology
of the system. Individual nodes in a topology have their own specific power
states and can be better represented in DT hierarchically"

> For such topologies the PSCI firmware driver acts

PSCI firmware can be represented as a pseudo power controller ?

I assume it should be  "..definitions of the idle states for CPU and the CPU
topology" above, otherwise they should conform to topology binding :) rather
than domain idle state bindings.

I would rather drop the above statement or specify in Example 2 that it can be
used for both OSI and PC.

Can we avoid using poweroff as it's one of the idle states and not the only
one ?

Other than that, the examples look good to me.
