According to the reference driver (and the datasheet of the newer
Meson8b/S805 and GXBB/S905 SoCs) there are 14 registers, each 32 bit
wide.
Adjust the register size to reflect that, as register offset 0x20 is
now also needed by the meson-ir driver.

changes in v1 -> v2:
- new patch, this is needed because we are now trying to read/write
  offset 0x20 which is beyond the space which was reserved previously
