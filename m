There are gaps (about 50-100m) between the buildings here indeed. And
you have to cross a road... Thankfully we have some network cables
underneath it.

I was remember when Will was adding the tile-detection code. That seemed
the best solution at the time (and spared us getting new mach type
number for every new tile), with no DT at the horizon. Situation changed
since and the tiles are just separate DT-only machine descriptions, as
your original implementation. There will be no more users of the
ct_desc.

It's not a improvement, just a workaround because that:

 void __init smp_init_cpus(void)
 {
-       ct_desc->init_cpu_map();
 }

implies existence of the ct_desc. But fair enough, I'll simply create
fake ones for the DT cases so this code won't have to be changed. As
soon as the platform SMP calls are abstracted, which as I understand is
one of steps on the mythical "single binary kernel" way, the problem
will disappear.

Thanks for spotting that, fixed.

All comments appreciated as always, thanks!
