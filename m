Right.

The user interface could eventually be the only part of the kernel that
uses the numbers, but you are right that we cannot change that.

I think it would be reasonable to force everybody to use gpiolib,
that's much easier than converting everyone to the descriptor based
interface.

Only legacy users did this. Initially there was only the header file,
with the API declared but several different implementations of it.
gpiolib was introduced later to reduce code duplication and allow having
multiple implementations in the same kernel.

I agree. Ideally we would convert them over as well, but there is no
need to rush that, or force it on anybody. We should just make sure
we don't grow any new platforms doing this.

I don't know enough about pinctrl to have a specific idea yet, but maybe
someone else has ideas. Regarding the integration of pinctrl with gpio,
I was thinking in the past that we could make pinctrl provide everything
that gpiolib does, and have a generic gpiolib driver on top of pinctrl
so that platforms don't need to implement both interfaces but only need
to provide a pure pinctrl driver. Not sure if this makes any sense.
