No Shawn, they don't.

To me, encountering this for the first time, the documentation is
_wrong_ no two ways about it - as I said in my initial email.  Please
fix it, or delete it.  Don't leave it in its current crap state.  Bad
or misleading documentation is worse than no documentation.

I am a "user" of this crap, and it is _very_ confusing that the
documentation is wrong, and the fact that I sent my initial email in
this thread is proof that your statement above is wrong.

For instance, "two integers array" is a lie, plain and simple.  Yes, it
may be true that what users care about is a macro and a number but that
is not a "two integers array".  It would be helpful here to explain that
PIN_FUNC refers to a macro in the imx*-pinfunc.h header file, which
expands to four or five integers.

Bit 31 (or even bit 30) in the config number are not documented
either.

All the numbers come into play when you're trying to port a platform,
because when you encounter something like this:

+       IOMUX_PAD(0x05E0, 0x0210, 3, 0x0790, 1, PAD_CTL_PKE | PAD_CTL_PUE | \
+               PAD_CTL_PUS_100K_DOWN | PAD_CTL_SPEED_LOW |     \
+               PAD_CTL_DSE_80ohm | PAD_CTL_SRE_FAST | PAD_CTL_HYS),

you need to be able to find out which of these C macros that corresponds
to for the pinfunc.h mess.

As it is, sorting out the pinmuxing on IMX is a nightmare - I've so far
spent almost 8 hours on this problem trying to work out what the right
way to describe this stuff is in DT, and its far from what I'd call fun.
And I've still more to do on this.

Please fix the documentation.
