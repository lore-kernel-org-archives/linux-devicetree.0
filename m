+postcore_initcall is not enough. Could you use postcore_initcall? So people
can hack right after populate devices.

imx_pinctrl_set_gpr_register is SoC specific. People who use it must
have sense of related registers and driver loading sequence.

Maybe we can do it, but why? It's kind of over-engineering.

Isn't it BUG ?
Normally, people like write_register(addr, mask, value),
and read_register(addr, mask);
