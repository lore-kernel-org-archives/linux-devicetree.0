Well, I considered it. My main reason for doing it this way was one of
debugging convenience. The debugger loads an ELF file and while I was
making lots of device tree changes in the tree and in the code, it was
more convenient to have one ELF file to deal with rather than an ELF
file and a dtb. And the thought was to get rid of it altogether once
bootloader support comes along. Maybe the thing to do would be to just
rip it out of the kernel. It can almost as easily be post-processing
step outside the kernel.
