Thank you for pointing this to me. I didn't realize the GPDR needs to
be configured
in PXA2xx. It's totally different from PXA3xx.

Since you need to configure both GPDRx and GAFRx. If we are talking
pinctrl-single
as reference, we can make it work by this way.

We need to define two pinmux controllers. One is for GPDRx, and the
other is for GAFRx.
Both of them need to support pinctrl-single,bits property. For any
alternate pins in DTS,
we could include these two pins from two pinmux controllers. What's
your opinion?

Haojian
