The bindings did not change here really, we still use "sound-dai" 
property to get handle to codec, previously the code was able to handle 
only one codec but with snd_soc_of_get_dai_link_codecs() it will now be 
able to handle multiple codecs.

Infact I have tested this series with ADV7533 audio codec(single codec) 
along with this msm8916 multi codec on this card.

I think a note in the bindings about the ability to handle multiple 
codecs be worth mentioning.
