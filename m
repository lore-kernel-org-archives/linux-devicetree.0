Only suitable / necessary if what the options are is dependent on the hardware
in some way that is not adequately described by the compatibility element.

To be cynical because it is PITA to change the assumption of it being
fixed :)  Oh well, another design decision that we got wrong a long time
back.

Hmm.  It is in theory acceptable to put default values that make sense
for a given set of hardware in device tree.  They are kind of a 
'well this will work' state.  Make sense if there are states that
don't make sense for a given hardware setup.

If all states make equally good sense, then perhaps we should look at
fixing up the IIO core to handle variable resolution devices.
That strikes me as a non trivial exercise, but could probably be
done.  We'd need to keep the simplicity of the current code
for the vast majority of devices, but provide some relatively clean
way of changing it when needed.

Whilst I'm happy if someone else wants to look at this, it is
nowhere near the top of my list!
