Haha. The entire device is just one big compatible string! I love
it! </sarcasm>

Seriously though, once the PMIC stuff appeared I started thinking
about some way to detect that dynamically because you're right,
it's already in DT somewhere and these huge compatible strings
are gross. Using aliases as Rob suggests should work nicely so
that we can find most of the elements with some simple tree
traversal. In the example above we would be left with
apq8074-v2.0-2-dragonboard/1-v0.1. Is that palatable?
