About 7 months have passed since I became a sub-arch maintainer (ARM/UniPhier),
and I am hoping now I deserve to have the gpg key thing you mentioned.

Could you help me get a key and a kernel.org account to host a git tree?

It would make it easier to get SoC-specific things in
without loading you and Olof.
