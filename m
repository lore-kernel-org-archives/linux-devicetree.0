We have to distinguish between state changes, bus error and other
errors. To make that clear, I have added an (old) annotated output from
the SJA1000, which is the defacto reference. Bus error reporting is
enabled and no cable is connected. Watch the TX error count increasing
and how the state changes:

CAN controller normally report state changes and some, like the SJA1000,
also individual bus errors including more information about the cause of
the problem. That information is not available for your controller and
therefore it does not make sense to report empty bus errors to the app.

The "berr-reporting" has been introduced some time ago, because the
bus-error rate can be quite high and may hang the system, especially
low-end systems. On the SJA1000 or Flexcan this can be simply achieved
by enabling bus-error interrupts. Signaling of state changes should
always work, though.

OK.

This should be handled in the following way:

1. If priv->can.restart_ms == 0: do *not* allow automatic restart
   That's what you alredy have implemented.

2. If priv->can.restart_ms  > 0 : do allow automatic restart.
   This requires to send CAN_ERR_RESTARTED when the system goes
   bus-on. See at91_can and mcp251x as example.

This looks good now. Just the automatic restart is missing as described
above.
