In that case the sysclk variable will remain cleared (0) and the
code that follows will trigger the PLL section with the N divider
for clock master mode (that mode is always used in clock slave mode).

Ooops, that is a leftover, and I think it can be removed. However, your
comment suggests that I have misunderstood the workings of
SND_SOC_DAPM_REGULATOR_SUPPLY. I thought dapm would take care of the
regulators (and the clocks for SND_SOC_DAPM_CLOCK_SUPPLY) so that
disabling regulators over suspend was handled by the asoc core?

This function is only called during probe, but yes, it needs to
do probe deferral. I'll fix that for the next version.

This is the same situation as for the regulators, I thought dapm
handled it and would prep/enable clocks when they were needed?

Me neither. I'll kill that export for the next round.

I'll wait for further input on the regulator/clock interaction with dapm
before I send a v2.
