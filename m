Well, U-Boot seems to deal with it just fine. The only SoCs where we
do it are SoCs where had to use the Allwinner bootloader.

I guess I don't really care, but if it's to indicate where the RAM is
mapped, we'd be better off by putting the max memory size there
instead of 0, and a comment saying that the bootloader is supposed to
patch this node.

And what happens when you simply don't have that information?

The issue is broader than that. It basically boils down to that: What
is your fixing strategy in case one of the clocks you put there
doesn't belong to the right parent?

If the driver is generic, it should not be just about the A64,
otherwise it's simply not generic.

So basically, you just tell "if you want to be as bug free and
featureful as possible, always keep your DT as up to date as
possible". Isn't that the exact same situation than before that whole
DT ABI debate?

Do you know a single linux distribution that doesn't update the kernel

It's true to some extent, but it's also something that is not critical
in any way: a typo'd name or a missing index will not affect the
system in any way. A wrong parent relationship might completely crash
the system if the actual parent is not enabled and you try to access
the device.

Which is something that you already have to do for any other drivers.

Since the "other OS developers" don't care about our bindings anyway and
make up their own, is that really something we should care about?

It's an argument that has been used since basically the switch to the
device tree, and it never happened, because there's basically no such
thing as a generic driver.

Let's take the example of the A64: we had a driver that was common to
all the SoCs so far for the MMC and MMC clocks, which was working fine
for all of them, so I guess it would be elligible to your definition
of generic. Comes the A64, with its modified phase behaviour, and a
MMC clock factor. Is it really something you expect to support without
a single change to the MMC driver and clocks driver?

This also goes against the whole policy of the clock framework for the
past couple of years to put less information in the DT. Mike asked
repeatedly to switch to a single clock controller node, and have a
driver that is registering everything, instead of exposing each and
every clock in the DT.

It's something we never took the time to do because we knew that we
could switch to it at any point in time. If you want to really have a
stable DT for the A64, then please use that scheme so that we never
have to switch to it in the future and break the ABI.

Who would provide that firmware? The vendor? Whose binding were never
ever reviewed?

I think we can have RTS/CTS alone in a separate node, just like we
already do for the SPI and its chip select, where each board can then
pick the combination it uses, without duplicating pins definitions.
