Ok will make the sequence like below
dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_LAYERSCAPE) += fsl-ls1012a-frdm.dtb
dtb-$(CONFIG_ARCH_LAYERSCAPE) += fsl-ls1012a-qds.dtb

OK, will include the #include <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h> in fsl-ls1012a.dtsi and edit the interrupts like below

Still not clear whether we need to  add "compatible = "fsl,ls1012a-clockgen";" in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/qoriq-clock.txt as there are contradictory thoughts that whether we need to add each compatible string in the bindings or not ?

Same clarification needed that whether we need to add each compatible string in the bindings or not ?
If we need to add I will  add [compatible = "fsl,ls1012a-scfg", "syscon";] in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/fsl.txt

That again need confirmation that whether we need to add each compatible string in bindings ?. If we need to add, I will add in

The u-boot will fix up the clock-frequency property with the correct value. So we can drop this property.

Amba-base is no longer used for QSPI driver in kernel, So I will remove this property.
