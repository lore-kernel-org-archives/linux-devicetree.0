It is a quite complex connection pattern and I am not sure if the modem=
 is really
a logical child of the USB interface. Powering up/down the USB interfac=
e has nothing
to do with the modem power. Rather, it continues to operate if USB is s=
uspended
and the modem notifies USB that it has become active.

The connections on this GTA04 board are:

Modem USB <=97> CPU USB
Modem PCM <=97> TWL4030 Voice <=97> OMAP3 McBSP4 (yes, it is a 3-way co=
nnection)
Modem Power control <=97> 1 or 2 GPIOs (depending on board variant)

The reason for the 3-way connection is that user space can chose if the=
 GSM
voice is routed directly to the TWL codec (low latency, independent of =
CPU) or
goes through the CPU (e.g. for DTAM or voice scrambling by software) an=
d
then through the other PCM link between the CPU and the TWL.

This is why I would make the McBSP4 a separate sound card.

And, this is why it needs some control and tri-state of the TWL4030 and=
 OMAP3
McBSP4 since only one can provide a digital PCM stream to the modem.

One more thing to consider for a general solution is that there are mod=
em modules
that communicate data through UART or SPI - but otherwise have a simila=
r connection
for digital audio. So forcing the power control driver to be a subnode =
of USB doesn=92t
appear general enough to me.

=46inally, this connection pattern is not specific to this modem (OPTIO=
N GTM601) on this
GTA04 board. We plan to use a Gemalto PHS8  in the Pyra-Handheld and th=
e Neo900
devices - but the general connection pattern as defined above remains t=
he same.

So my proposal is to have a specific wwan-power driver for this type of=
 modems.
And power control can and should be kept separately from USB (except th=
e case
where only 1 GPIO exists and USB must be tapped to detect the modem pow=
er
state). You can find work in progress for this approach here:

What I wonder a little is that we have all these dai-links working sinc=
e your 3.7
kernel for GTA04. Is it necessary to re-invent a solution or should we =
just make
the solution device tree compatible?
