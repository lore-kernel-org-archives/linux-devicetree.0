We are totally limited with hardware to test other devices on this 
codec. Given the fact that no one is actively working on adding support 
to other devices ATM.
Also IRC discussions with you suggested that I should move this driver 
to codecs for now and when a new device support comes up we can move it 
back to mfd.

Regarding other comments, I will make sure that address them if the code 
is still there after moving to codecs.

thanks,
