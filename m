Any further comment on this? I'd like to submit v10 of this patch soon.
As of now, my patch will still look essentially the same (with only
minor changes for some of the review comments), since I'm convinced
neither that my current per-cpu flag-based solution is unsound nor that
a delayed work queue can solve all of the same problems.

BTW, I think this delay can be dropped. It was retained from an early
non-production release of this CPU.
